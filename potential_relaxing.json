        "Content": "Some games hide mystery in their titles, practically begging for every narrative thread to be pulled on to discover the secrets behind those words. PowerWash Simulator is not like this. Its direct name reveals that it is exactly what you think it is: the chance to live out your fantasy(?) as a water gun for hire, moving from job to job until all the dirt is blasted into oblivion. There's not a great deal of variety in such a career, and monotony can sink in, but a fundamentally simple yet satisfying style of gameplay provides a great way to chill out across numerous generously sized levels. Yes, it is just simulating the usually mundane act of hosing down your patio once a year, but PowerWash Simulator elevates itself above what could so easily become tedium by subtly gamifying the chore and shoving the most annoying parts under the rug. Anyway, let's try not to get too philosophical about it: Here's my review, in which I analyse a game about washing a 30-foot high shoe. There\u2019s something therapeutic about PowerWash Simulator. Maybe it's because, at the time of writing, I'm sweltering in 39 \u00b0C (102\u00b0F) weather and incapable of moving without sweat clouding my vision, but the sheer amount of water being blasted onto the screen is borderline intoxicating. It's like a form of visual white noise, and I've lost hours on end to this meditative sim about nothing more than taking your time to clean the hell out of whatever is put in front of you. It removes all the irritations of real-life power washing - lugging a bulky machine around, tripping over extension cables etc. - focusing instead of the act of sending water screaming into a wall. The complete lack of music and voice acting only adds to the calm, with only the sound of water breaking the silence \u2013 aside from the 'ding' noise that sounds each time an object is fully clean which adds a real Pavlovian edge to proceedings. PowerWash Simulator Screens (Xbox version) 7 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Each job starts the same way: a scene resembling the aftermath of a Splatoon round where the brown team won faces you, and your mission is to clean the mess and return it to its original spotless state. If you're feeling a bit obtuse you could even call it a first-person shooter \u2013 if the aliens or army men were replaced with inanimate plastic flower pots and delicate wooden trellises, that is. During the surprisingly lengthy career mode of more than 20 hours you\u2019re faced with building your small business up as you take request after request, cleaning up buildings and vehicles before reinvesting your earnings into better power washers and their accompanying attachments and soaps. You repeat the same routine no matter the job at hand, equipping the widest angle of the five available nozzle types to blast away large swathes of dirt on bigger surfaces before dialling in a more aggressive, narrow nozzle to deal with the finer details. A more concentrated burst of water is needed to get rid of those extra-stubborn materials \u2013 lichen, moss, rust \u2013 you know the stuff. You do have to change your angle in order clean gunk out from various grooves, nooks, and crannies, but that\u2019s about it. It really is the definition of a rinse-and-repeat job \u2013 low on challenge, but reliant on sound methodology. It\u2019s a highly satisfying loop though, as a daunting 100-square-foot roof gradually becomes a clean slate to be proud of \u2013 not before leaving a second-rate Jackson Pollock and childlike messages in the dirt, that is. A majority of the levels are extensive, often taking well over an hour to scrub to 100% and gain that valuable five-star rating. And with 38 jobs in total, there\u2019s a significant amount to keep you busy. The more stars you collect in career mode, the more complex the levels you unlock. Earning both stars and cash is how you progress, allowing you to splash your earnings on better power washer equipment to make future jobs that much easier. Progression may be limited to only a few options over the course of the whole campaign, but the tangible improvements to each tool can be felt - with each, more expensive, power washer increasing in power. That being said, there's not a great deal of experimentation needed and I soon settled on my loadout of choice, complete with a long extension that maximised the washer's range, and the second-widest angle nozzle, which offers a satisfying balance between pressure and area of effect. I enjoyed it so much that I even found myself blurting out the phrase \"25-degree nozzle OP!\" as I hosed down the side of a fire station, like I was on a rampant Call of Duty killstreak. I must have looked like an idiot. Cleaning liquids \u2013 one for each relevant surface such as metal, wood etc. \u2013 can be applied, but come in fairly short supply, so have to be used smartly to maximise their effect. While they do make some challenges a bit simpler, in truth I neglected them for the most part, favouring a sharp burst of water instead as it just felt more enjoyable due to the satisfying nature of the blasts and the base level of skill it encourages. Tools, such as ladders and scaffolding, can be moved around each area to help reach dirt in high places and get a new blasting angle, which adds a light puzzle element but nothing that strays too far into challenging territory. Is power washing in real life fun? Yes No I haven't tried it, but now all I can think about is giving it a go Answer See Results Very occasionally, the levels themselves throw something different into the mix as well to keep things moderately fresh. Examples include a mansion that tests your sniping skills as you clean it from a distance behind a gated wall, and a carousel which requires you to turn it on and off \u2013 making it rotate \u2013 in order to scrub every inch of dirt. These challenges are few and far between though, and require spending only a little more brain power than usual. In truth, PowerWash Simulator is not a game that\u2019s worried about difficulty spikes or introducing complex mechanics, but much more at home treating us to a relaxing, casual affair. In this endeavour, it often found a sweet spot that kept me coming back for more. Every so often, frustration can set in when trying to find the smallest speck in quite a large area, though. I found myself scouring the seemingly endless floor of a skatepark looking for smudges of dirt with a highlighting tool in a manner not dissimilar from using a UV light to uncover the more unsavoury stains at a crime scene. However, it\u2019s a bit less exciting than that because the only crimes being committed here are unforgivable levels of uncleanliness on show from whoever owns these properties. It's not taking itself too seriously, and it would be frankly bizarre if it did. \u201c Maps range from the mundane to the fantastical, with riffs on fairytale homes, a suitably red-dusted Mars rover, and a statue from an ancient civilization. There\u2019s a very loose plot to trace, but PowerWash Simulator clearly isn\u2019t too worried about telling a great story \u2013 it\u2019s all about getting you cleaning as varied and interesting a set of buildings and vehicles as possible. It's not taking itself too seriously, and it would be frankly bizarre if it did, with some genuinely amusing moments coming from the texts you receive from clients and their oddball messages. There\u2019s no voice acting to interrupt the silence. Outside of the single-player campaign, there\u2019s the option to play the whole of career mode with a friend in co-op, or any job unlocked in free-play with up to five other players. There are no competitive options aside from racing against the clock to clean like the wind in the challenge mode, but it does serve as a relaxing space to treat as a chat room while you subconsciously hose down a carousel inexplicably covered in a field\u2019s worth of mud."

        "Content": "Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. Without question, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-ass foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.  Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic. Much of the credit goes to the artists at Rockstar North who created as believable a city as possible. Liberty City is inspired by New York, but not beholden to it. While there are many parallels, Liberty exists in its own universe and rightfully so. Many open-world games have cities that feel as if they existed only from the moment you first turned on your console, but Liberty City looks lived in. It's an old city and each block has its own vibe and its own history. Drive around Liberty City and you'll be able to identify each individual block. Though Liberty is filled with brownstones and a myriad of similar brick buildings, you can tell one from the other, just as you can in New York. Go to an affluent neighborhood and the street is likely to be newly paved, the pedestrians better dressed, the cops more plentiful. But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying on the weak.  Niko is fresh off the boat. Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents. Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship. Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself.  You never have to be alone. A high-priced call girl is always at the ready. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored. To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade.  The explosions are wicked. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight. This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough. There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.  You don't need a posse to rule the streets. Just a bat and balls of steel. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good. The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller.  GTA IV plays out like a high-octane action flick. Michael Bay just got served. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary. Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location. Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next. I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact.  Is it suicide if you take someone with you? You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.  The world is yours online. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud. If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from.  A meeting of the online minds. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it. And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer. As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing.  The Special Edition Those who want a little more bang from GTA IV can purchase the special edition for $89.99. Packaged in a large, attractive cardboard box, the Special Edition includes some nice swag, but lacks the traditional \"Making Of\" DVD that generally proves most enticing for gamers willing to shell extra cheddar. GTA IV: The Special Edition includes the following:   Metal lock box with GTA IV logo embossing  Rockstar Duffel Bag  Soundtrack Sampler  Art Book  Rockstar key chain  Standard copy of GTA IV  The duffel bag has a nice yellow lining and a large Rockstar logo. It's big enough to fit a cat or mob boss's head. The lock box is the better container. This non-descript metal box is the perfect place to lock up your game to keep it away from children. There's enough bonus space to hide rolled up Playboy's and your relaxation medication. Perhaps this is what Al Gore was going on about back in 2000. Makes sense now. There is no official soundtrack box set for GTA IV, because songs can be purchased individually through the Rockstar Social Club. So getting 16 of the best tracks on one CD is actually a pretty solid deal. You'll get the GTA IV instrumental theme along with a new Nas song, Busta Rhymes and Mobb Deep. I'd still rather have a full-fledged soundtrack release, but this is the next best thing.  Worth the extra $30? Complete track list:   Michael Hunter - Soviet Connection (Theme from GTA IV)  Mobb Deep featuring Havoc & Prodigy - Dirty New Yorker  The Rapture - No Sex for Ben  Munga - No Fraid A  Busta Rhymes - Where's My Money  C.J. - I Want You  Joe Walsh - Rocky Mountain Way  Bob Marley & The Wailers and Damian Marley - Stand Up Jamrock  Seryoga - Liberty City: The Invasion  Greenskeepers - Vagabond  Electrik Funk - On a Journey  Qadir - Nickname  David Axelrod - Holy Thursday  Nas - War is Necessary  Fela Kuti - Zombie  Global Communication - 5:23  Lastly, there is the art book, which features concept art, wireframe models, screenshots, and a small amount of insight into the art design process. It's not going to be enough to satisfy those who want to understand what it takes to make an epic such as Grand Theft Auto IV, but it's all you're going to get. Should you get GTA IV: SE? That depends on what you expect from a collector's edition. The lack of a making of DVD is a major letdown -- so if insight into the creative process is what you're after, save your $30 and buy the regular game. If you like chotchkies, then there is a little more for you. The duffel bag is average, but the lock box is pretty swank. It's certainly the best case for a collector's edition that I've seen. I won't deny that the soundtrack has some great songs -- but great enough to add a $30 value to GTA IV? That's a tough call. The game is no less great, but the Special Edition is only for those with money to burn and a desire to have a metal box to lock their game inside each night."

        "Content": "At first I was afraid, I was petrified \u2013 I kept thinking \"how could Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?\" But then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now we\u2019re back, in outer space\u2026 okay, okay, don\u2019t leave! I\u2019ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order\u2019s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this. Especially considering that there\u2019s no reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven\u2019t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired \u2013 there\u2019s no corny amnesia or other, \u201cOh no, my powers are gone!\u201d gimmick to make you re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as we left him five years prior. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch has been rocky, especially on the PC version, which Respawn has publicly apologized for and already begun to patch . Before you buy it, make sure to watch our in-depth Performance review. So we\u2019re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape. You\u2019re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that\u2019s just the beginning \u2013 the Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with your double-jump, things really take off \u2013 you can cover such crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was possible. It\u2019s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles. Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star Wars melee battles I\u2019ve ever seen. You don\u2019t even have to be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids \u2013 not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded \u2013 makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations. Lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. \u201c After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that answers the question of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if Han Solo were also a Jedi?\u201d The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy broadsword that\u2019s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor, while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in close. It\u2019s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning slash to cut them all down like blades of grass.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You can only equip two of the five stances at any given time, which at first seemed artificially limiting \u2013 and it is, when you think about it \u2013 but I came to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more personality as a fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own skill tree, so you\u2019re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no regrets. By the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorite stances, and no regrets. \u201c It\u2019s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate what\u2019s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That\u2019s very much in keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for a game like this, it seldom feels like there\u2019s a lot of time pressure to rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you\u2019re presented with by locals doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re neglecting a responsibility to save the galaxy. What We Said About Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order It\u2019s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. \u2013 Dan Stapleton, November 14, 2019 Score: 9 Read the full Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order review Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain unspoiled here, but they\u2019re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away. In any case, at least they\u2019re written and acted with enough depth that they don\u2019t feel like retreads of anyone Cal\u2019s faced before, and neither is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There\u2019s more to them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot for the most part. The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force. \u201c The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan\u2019s Cal is not so easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about more than simply fighting the Empire now: it\u2019s about whether he can live a life where he\u2019s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of his guilt, and find a home that\u2019s safe. His path after escaping Order 66 is contrasted against what could\u2019ve been if he\u2019d had different priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much more realized protagonist this time around. Every IGN Star Wars Game Review 113 Images Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal\u2019s side, but the rest of the crew are all given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and why they\u2019re coming back together now. Greez\u2019s loveable cantankerousness made him a favorite, and he\u2019s happy to deliver more of that along with some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his \u201cgrab some seat\u201d catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she\u2019s less of a constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. Cere's power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. \u201c Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of the group is Bode. He\u2019s another roguish mercenary type who, much like Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the two bro it up to establish the friendship they\u2019ve struck up fighting the Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however, he does become a more interesting companion. Dan's favorite Star Wars games I've been playing Star Wars games since the late 80s - here are my picks. See All Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Aspyr Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Obsidian Entertainment Star Wars: TIE Fighter LucasArts Star Wars: Empire at War Petroglyph Star Wars Battlefront II [2005] Pandemic Studios Star Wars: Dark Forces LucasArts Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Vicarious Visions Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Respawn Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Respawn Star Wars: The Force Unleashed -- Ultimate Sith Edition LucasArts Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor\u2019s single most thrilling action sequence). They can\u2019t be killed or downed in action so there\u2019s no management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy while you thin out his friends\u2019 ranks. Beyond that, they\u2019re only really used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1\u2019s adorable bleeps and bwoops couldn\u2019t do alone. Survivor takes advantage of that fact that it takes place at the midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. \u201c Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial Inquisitors it\u2019s a relief to see that the Empire\u2019s role here is more in the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are mostly here to provide variety after you\u2019ve been fighting the main enemy army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It\u2019s a clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy enemies together into the same game \u2013 one that takes advantage of the fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. There\u2019s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen Order \u2013 no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It\u2019s a good mix of enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order\u2019s already respectable lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I\u2019d temporarily Force-confused to my side) it\u2019s a great time. On the subject of creatures, one of Cal\u2019s many new abilities is to tame non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn\u2019t ever used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than Cal could\u2019ve run on foot. Given that running doesn\u2019t drain his stamina, it seems that it\u2019s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There\u2019s also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very specific points, so it\u2019s not much of a game-changer either, but it does play nicely into environmental puzzles. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor. \u201c Speaking of environments, this journey takes us to a handful of never-before-seen planets, some of which are expansive and include a variety of extremely different areas within them. Koboh, for instance, has everything from grasslands to swamp to underground facilities, a massive crashed Separatist ship, and even its own version of Cloud City. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor that are either 100 percent desert or completely covered in redwoods, respectively. Every time I entered a new area I\u2019d circle the camera, looking for the telltale signs the level designers leave to indicate a wall is runnable, a ceiling can be clung to, a crack can be squeezed through, and more. By the time I was done with my 30-hour run through the story I had trouble even remembering to use all of the abilities I had learned because there are simply so many. Levels are meticulously thought-out puzzles in and of themselves, and only rarely did I run across something that didn\u2019t feel intuitive or fair once I took into account all the tools at my disposal. The Enemies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor 11 Images Considering that this adventure is roughly equal parts combat and puzzle-solving, the fact that there\u2019s such a broad selection of types works in its favor. Puzzles that deal with directing energy beams and even painting paths are clever and well done, on par (and sharing some ideas) with a lot of what we saw in God of War Ragnarok last year. Some involve using BD-1 to launch projectiles to trigger remote switches, some have rolling homing bombs, and some use deployable balloons you can grapple to and launch off of. A few of the main storyline puzzles gave me cause to scratch my head for a few minutes before the solution sprung to mind, which is just about the right level of challenge. They aren\u2019t groundbreaking in their design, but consistently fun nonetheless. Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game. \u201c Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game with beautifully detailed environments and characters\u2026 and perhaps as a result, not one of the best performing. My PS5 playthrough saw some fairly gnarly slowdowns from the expected 30 frames per second in 4K Quality Mode, especially when fighting around smoke or fog, which made timing by parries and dodges difficult. Disappointingly, even the 1440p Performance Mode isn\u2019t close to holding a locked 60fps. I also saw a few crashes and bugs that forced me to quit and reload my save to progress (though this was before the day one patch). EA has naturally promised more patches will come with improvements on all platforms, but if history is any guide it might take a little while before it\u2019s completely ironed out. A smooth frame rate is certainly important when battling Survivor\u2019s multiple lightsaber-wielding bosses, because there\u2019s no shortage of challenge in learning the timing of parrying their strikes and dodging their unblockable attacks. I must confess: after several hours of banging my head against the brutal final boss I finally resorted to turning the difficulty down a notch to see the ending in time for this review, which hurt my pride because I\u2019d made it to his final phase but couldn\u2019t quite get over the finish line. That said, there\u2019s not a lot that felt especially novel about these fights; they\u2019re well made, but conventional and one aspect that hasn\u2019t seen a great improvement from Fallen Order. One smart tweak that does stand out, however, is that when a boss kills you, the next time you come at him he\u2019s not glowing yellow signifying you\u2019ll get your health back the first time you hit him like a normal enemy does. Instead, there\u2019s a glowing pillar of light where you fell, and picking that up heals you. That allows you to save the full-health pick-up for when you need it rather than just as the fight begins \u2013 it\u2019s a smart and welcome evolution of Fallen Order\u2019s already ingenious system of tipping the scales in your favor when you need it. I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack. \u201c When it comes to tracking those bosses down in the first place, I certainly appreciate that the Jedi games give you a map (unlike other games of this style that I could name that delight in making you figure it out) but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to usability. Just like in Fallen Order, this map seems so dedicated to the idea of resembling a light-blue Star Wars hologram that it\u2019s not always easy to figure out what you\u2019re looking at and the directions its waypoints give you aren\u2019t always accurate. However, its dotted lines were generally good enough to point me in the right direction when I struggled to find a path forward or was feeling lost, or redirect me when I was trying to figure out a way past an obstacle I didn\u2019t have the right gear for yet. Also, this time Respawn has granted us the ability to fast-travel between save points, which feels like an act of mercy when the objective is on the other side of one of these large, labyrinthian maps. These maps are dense, too, and Survivor is packed full of stuff to do around the edges of the main story, including bounty hunters and legendary creatures to track down and kill, combat challenges, and more. Some of them are seriously tough, even on the default Jedi Knight difficulty level; I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack, other than that it was literally dozens. But I got him in the end! You\u2019ll also unlock a full New Game+ mode once you beat the story, which is a welcome feature that Fallen Order didn\u2019t have until more than six months after launch. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images On top of all of that, there\u2019s an intimidating amount of stuff to collect, including plants and fish which can then be displayed in the cantina in your base town on Koboh. But while there might be some unlocks at the end of those sidequests, it doesn\u2019t do much to convince you that these are activities you should spend a lot of time on\u2026 unless you really like plopping down seeds on rooftop gardens or watching a virtual aquarium. Of course some rewards are much more enticing to a Star Wars fan. Cal\u2019s lightsaber and blaster both have many customizable cosmetic parts that you can mix and match to form your own creation, and even though you can barely make out those details when you\u2019re using it in a fight unless you zoom in with the photo mode, it\u2019s a fantastic, loving bit of Star Wars detail to obsessively mess with whenever you find a new piece. Plus, all of the available lightsaber blade colors are unlocked shortly after the start so that you can make Cal more your own from the very beginning. That also goes for his range of clothing options, which is far more extensive this time around, as well as his entirely new haircut and beard options. He\u2019ll always be the same Cal Kestis underneath it, but your soul-patch and mullet-wearing character will have a very different vibe from mine, whose crew cut and beard resembles a redheaded version of Amos Burton from The Expanse. Yes, it\u2019s a little silly to find hair and beard options in treasure chests, but sure, why not? Similarly, I\u2019m just delighted at the customization for BD-1. In the first game, you could only change his paint job, but his enduring popularity (which led to his Mandalorian cameo) has paid dividends because now we get many more options for components on his face, head, \u201cears,\u201d body, and legs, as well as detailed color options and even the level of wear and tear. Just wait until you see the way his body reacts to having pieces swapped out in the customization menu! It\u2019s another lovely little touch in a game that presents so many.

        "Content": "Note: This review exclusively covers the multiplayer modes of Splatoon 3. For our thoughts on the campaign, check out our Splatoon 3 single-player campaign review. At first glance, you might not notice too much that\u2019s wildly different about Splatoon 3\u2019s multiplayer options when compared to its predecessors, but diving into its ink-covered warzones reveals a heaping helping of quality-of-life changes lurking just below the surface. It has better lobby systems, multiple practice ranges, and even more customization options to make your character shine \u2013 not to mention stylish new weapons and terrifying new Salmon Run foes that mix up its familiar formula in exciting ways. It may forego any drastic additions or changes, but Splatoon 3 skillfully fine-tunes everything that made its team-based multiplayer so extremely compelling already. For those not familiar with Nintendo\u2019s cephalopod shooter, Splatoon\u2019s main multiplayer modes pit two teams of four against each other, using ink-spewing weapons to satisfyingly coat both the ground and your enemies in shiny goop. Your squid or octo-based character can seamlessly shift forms to glide through your team\u2019s ink and rapidly advance, popping up out to fire a variety of weapons and build out further territory. Splatoon 3\u2019s main mode \u2014 Turf Wars \u2014 tasks your team with covering the most ground before time runs out, while other modes for more experienced players add in specific objectives like protecting payloads or towers. The modes themselves may not have changed here, but they are still as fun as ever, bolstered by new weapons, specials, and tactical moves to take advantage of within them. Nintendo Switch OLED Splatoon 3 Special Edition 7 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Matches are as fast as they are frantic, but are approachable enough that anyone can easily get into them and have a blast. Even if you miss inking another player to eliminate them in Turf Wars, you\u2019ll still be inadvertently painting the ground to help your team towards victory. Splatoon 3 has also made a smart tweak by moving your starting position and respawn point from an easily abused spot on the ground to launchpads up in the air, letting you pick which part of your base to launch into (and see where your teammates are going to launch), or check the map to easily target a teammate on the field to give them backup. This does wonders for letting teams escape getting camped in their own starting area, so long as they coordinate their efforts. I really came to like the tall towers in Scorch Gorge that made for excellent sniping spots. \u201c Each map is nearly symmetrical, with tricky terrain elements that offer tactical opportunities like mesh walkways to slip through, ink rails to zip along, paths to ambush from above, and multiple routes with different strategic advantages. The Turf Wars mode in particular never loses its chaotic fun, as there are plenty of chances for last second comebacks and extremely close matches. Even if your team gets totally demolished, the quick match time for all of its modes ensures you\u2019ll be back at it again in no time, and the calling of \u201cjust one more match\u201d is hard to shake. Many of the best maps from previous Splatoon iterations have returned \u2014- that includes Mahi-Mahi Resort and its changing water level that reveals more turf to ink, as well as the MakoMart that has you splatting foes along the aisles of a giant supermarket. Of its new additions, I really came to like the tall towers in Scorch Gorge that made for excellent sniping spots (or points to ambush using the new Zipcaster special), and the Hagglefish Market\u2019s various routes that let me tear through boxes of debris. Most maps are tweaked slightly for ranked battles to allow the addition of moving towers or goals, but they all provide lasting fun whether you\u2019re trying grinding against other competitive players or casually repping your chosen team during the new three-way Splatfest events. One great change from Splatoon 2 is the ability to keep playing with your current group to let the good times continue to roll (both for PvP and PvE modes). It\u2019s awesome to be able to stick with a good group of random players after a win, and even nicer to not have to remake a group with your friends after every match when you just want to have some more relaxed fun together. The only downside I\u2019ve noticed is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to cancel out of matchmaking when you choose to stay together, which seems like an odd oversight that left me in matchmaking purgatory a few times when the rest of the group bailed. As you level up from playing matches, you\u2019ll be able to browse Splatoon 3\u2019s huge assortment of weapons, which range from traditional blasters and speed-increasing ink rollers to literal paint buckets and precise snipers. All of Splatoon 2\u2019s best options can be found among those offered at the store, including two new weapon types. The allure of the Splatana (a giant squeegee on a wiper blade) caught my sword-loving eyes, though I have yet to master its extremely precise swipes that emit projectiles that remind me of The Legend of Zelda\u2019s Master Sword. The other new armament is a bow called the Tri Stringer, which can be charged up to unleash three ink bolts that explode after a short pause. It\u2019s a fun concept that has great potential in pinning down foes or keeping them away from objectives. What We Said About Splatoon 3's Single-Player Splatoon 3\u2019s single-player campaign takes all the highs of Splatoon 2\u2019s creative Octo Expansion missions and places them in a satisfying hub world where freedom of choice lets you get as much as you want out of your playthrough \u2014 confident that you\u2019ll be back for more. Even when it relies heavily on familiar enemies, smart level design and objectives, and bosses brimming with personality keep things fresh for the whole ride. Score: 8 Read the full single-player review. Each weapon is paired with a special move, and the sheer variety of both new and returning specials add a wonderful sense of unpredictable mayhem to the battlefield. From deployable shield domes to buff dispensers and exploding dolphins (complete with an \u201cAkira slide\u201d), I encountered many instances where a well-timed special turned the tide for my team at the last moment. My favorite by far has been the Zipcaster, letting me tether and fling myself to almost any surface, which has opened up so many fun new opportunities for ambushes and taking down sniper nests \u2014 though it\u2019s extremely limited duration before I\u2019m sent back to where I started is a clever way to keep it from being abused. Earlier Splatoon games required players to accumulate currency from matches to buy different weapons, but Splatoon 3 has done a great job anticipating the needs of returning players in order to make weapon acquisition easier. Here you get a token each time you level up (or level up an armament from repeated use) that can be exchanged for one weapon, and while there\u2019s a slow but steady roll-out of beginner friendly weapons at first, you can also choose to spend three tokens to pick out any weapon regardless of its level requirement. This benefits both veterans who want to go right to their favorite, and also newer players who might not want to wait 10 levels to get another bucket-type armament if they\u2019ve come to love the one they\u2019ve been using early on. Splatoon 3 has done a great job anticipating the needs of returning players. \u201c In fact, many of the new tweaks and changes in Splatoon 3 seem to have its experienced players (especially competitive ones) in mind. You\u2019ll find not just one or two, but four different firing ranges to try out weapons depending on where you are and which mode you\u2019re practicing for. The inclusion of a Recon Mode is also an extremely welcome one, letting you freely explore any of its 12 launch maps in order to get an understanding of the level's terrain and choke points on your own. After playing multiplayer matches, you can now view replays of your last 50 battles too, which included a wealth of great options like being able to swap to another player\u2019s view on either team with a quick button press, or quickly scrub through the timeline and set up highlights to share online. The best addition by far is the new lobby, as you will no longer be trapped in a nebulous menu while you wait for matchmaking to begin. There\u2019s now a wonderful open space to wander where you can see holograms of your friends to check what they\u2019re up to (or if they have a spot you can join), and make use of the giant practice range\u2019s many neat features \u2014 and even clean up all the ink with the press of a button. In between matches, you can quickly swap out stat-boosting clothing and weapons (something that wasn\u2019t available when Splatoon 2 first debuted), and also see other players running around the practice range before the next match starts. The best addition by far is the new lobby. \u201c Not only are these new additions sorely needed, they\u2019re presented in a cool and stylish way that perfectly echoes the fresh fashion and design of Splatsville. A locker room even lets you customize your very own cubby with stickers and gear as another place to express your personality, or create dioramas as quirky and bizarre as the player social posts and art that can appear all over the square. You\u2019ll also earn new titles, badges, banners, and more that add even more customizable style to your inkling character \u2014 many of which can be gained from a new Battle Pass system (that thankfully requires no opt-in purchases) that\u2019s given me yet another great reason to keep diving back into multiplayer. Splatoon 3 still holds a strict and sometimes nonsensical insistence on gating certain features that were present in previous incarnations. I understand why new players really should try playing Turf War before anything else \u2014 including the PvE Salmon Run mode that unlocks at level four, and the ranked objective modes in Anarchy Battles that unlock at level ten \u2014 but you\u2019re also banned from shops and even your own locker room until level four for reasons I\u2019m still trying to justify. Even the mediocre new tabletop card game seems needlessly gated, despite it being only against AI for the time being. At least for those returning players with Splatoon 2 save data, you\u2019ll be able to hop right into ranked battles and buy a few choice weapons early on. What is your favorite Splatoon Weapon Type? Shooters Blasters Chargers Rollers Brushes Sloshers Splatlings Dualies Brellas Splatanas Stringers Answer See Results The aforementioned PvE Salmon Run has returned, and thankfully it\u2019s now available to queue up for 24/7 instead of the bizarre decision the previous game made to close it down for hours at a time. You\u2019ll still be given random weapons from a set as you and three other players battle hordes of encroaching Salmonids, and the new Splatana and Tri Stringer can really shine here. I particularly love the new intro that showcases you and your buddies preparing to launch out of a helicopter like you\u2019ve been dropped into Metal Gear Solid 5. The act of surviving waves of enemies while collecting golden eggs from the various boss monsters that show up is still a lot of fun, and there are some great new tweaks here too. Most notable among those changes is the ability to launch a golden egg you\u2019re carrying ahead of you like a grenade. This opens up a huge realm of possibilities for maximizing your time on a map as you can bank shots like a pro basketball player. Working to create an egg tossing relay with my team was incredibly satisfying, and proved even a random group without voice chat could sync up like a well-oiled machine. Of course, the tradeoff is that launching eggs requires a ton of stored ink just like a grenade, and may leave you vulnerable and out of ammo as a result \u2014 which is another great risk vs. reward choice to introduce to a mode already full of them. These modes are only great when fighting with or against other players, which is something I haven\u2019t been able to do enough of quite yet. \u201c New boss enemies also bring fresh strategies to the mix, like the \u201cFish Stick\u201d that drops a giant spire into the ground to harass you from above. Being able to take them out and then use their pillar as an attack point is a great touch. To reward players for repeated wins, a new Godzilla-like salmon boss can now appear too if you\u2019ve been on a roll, and the atmosphere instantly changes when it does. Instead of stockpiling eggs, you\u2019re encouraged to use them as ammo to launch into the beast to take it down \u2014 but you\u2019ll still be rewarded for making it as far as you have even if your team is defeated. Defeating this fishy kaiju also lets you unlock even more exclusive rewards, which is a great way to show off your salmon-hunting prowess to the masses, and gives even more reasons to keep coming back to survive the ever more difficult waves."

I fell in love with its calming music, stress-free exploration, and incredible aesthetic in 2009. On Vita, it's the serene bliss of Flower suffers from notable problems for the first time. Imprecise motion controls, and touch controls that take time to learn, occasionally contribute frustration to an otherwise zen experience. If you already own it on PS3 or PlayStation 4, it\u2019s yours for free on Vita -- but it's the worst way to experience this amazing game. The Greatest Outdoors Flower is a bit bewildering, conceptually, but its clean systems make it accessible and understandable despite the lack of explicit explanation. Levels begin with you controlling the force of the wind, guiding a single petal through fields of flowers. Breezing through grass and over hills brings dim, dark places to life, and each flower you touch blossoms, earning you another petal. By the end of a stage, your lonely starting petal is the centerpiece of a majestic floral trail, sailing through the sky of a gorgeous place you\u2019ve helped create. Vibrance and change is an inspiring form of visual feedback -- colorful plant life represents progress, success, and the mark you\u2019ve made in these incredible spaces. Every time I play through its 90 minute story, Flower leaves me with the same strong lasting impression I felt the first time. You are not just an explorer here: You are a creator. The uncomplicated input of its motion/tilt controls leads to a satisfying sense of minimum effort/maximum gain, allowing you to revive dead plants and open canyons by casually coasting through field and finding life to unlock at your own pace. Unfortuntely, the imprecision of Vita's motion sensor means you won't be making sharp turns in the same, effortless fashion you would on a DualShock 4. It's functional here, certainly, but takes time to learn -- in a game as brief and simple as this, spending time learning hardly ideal. The touch controls also require some effort to understand. Katamari Damacy fans will find themselves swiveling and spinning with ease, but using the left and right sides of the Vita's touch screen to guide the wind feels odd and out of place comparatively. Both inputs are fine, but come with frustrations that have no place in Flower -- and don't exist in other versions. The mechanics rarely change, but the simplicity of your interaction has a wide range of rewarding results. You achieve wondrous things, and it becomes clearer as you proceed that there\u2019s a reason for it -- despite its minimalism, Flower has phenomenal ambition and a clear goal in mind. Throughout its relaxing, stress-free discovery, Flower subtly conveys a story of life, destruction, fear, and rebirth. It has something to say about nature, humanity\u2019s destructive tendencies, and whether or not they can coexist. Games rarely feature thoughtful or relevant commentary. Flower has meaningful messaging, but it never preaches gospel or intrudes on the sublime meandering and resurrection. If metaphor or symbolism don\u2019t do anything for you, Flower is just as enjoyable as a game where you explore a dying world, discover the tasks required to resurrect it, and move on having accomplished something beautiful. Flower - PlayStation 4 Review Album 4 Images Machine Power Flower on Vita looks more like the PS3 original than the PS4's spectacular 1080p resolution and 60 frames per-second performance. It still runs smooth, looks marvelous, and is every bit as visually and aurally excellent as Flower was. After an hour or two, when it\u2019s all over, there\u2019s little room for Flower to do anything more with what it has.

        "Content": "Yearly sports titles tend to face an uphill battle. While the likes of EA\u2019s FIFA and Madden could easily get by on roster changes alone, most other games really need to prove their mettle to get punters to pony up their hard earned cash again. Yet for its third outing with the Formula One license, that\u2019s just what Codemasters have done with F1 2012, delivering numerous small-but-notable improvements over the last two years\u2019 offerings. Everything starts with the young drivers test in a meticulously recreated Yas Marina Stadium and racetrack in Abu Dhabi. Taking you through everything from vehicle handling, acceleration, and breaking to the more advanced elements of the sports such as KERS and DRS, a mixture of hands on time and short instructional videos prove invaluable to those either unfamiliar with the sport or new to its digital recreations. Depending on your inherent skill, the young drivers test will take about 40 minutes to 1 hour to complete but this solid foundation in gameplay mechanics will prove time well spent. Even returning F1 players should appreciate this refresher course in basic training, as there are plenty of nuanced differences to pick up on that reflect the changes the FIA has introduced to the motorsport since F1 2011 hit shelves. It\u2019s just one small aspect of the game\u2019s commitment to authenticity. Obviously, a number of recognisable drivers were practically a given \u2013 Raikonnen, Button, Hamilton, et al \u2013 but appearances by real-world team members, such as Red Bull\u2019s team principal Christian Horner and race commentary from former F1 driver Anthony Davidson, helps craft a truly immersive experience. From the training mode onward, F1 2012 does a fantastic job of placing you in the mindset of an up-and-coming driver. Emails from agents and teammates advise you of race specifics or analyse your performance afterwards, helping put your head in the game. The tension, the weight of expectation of your colleagues, almost feels palpable, all creating a determination on your part to improve. Improvement is something you\u2019ll have to work hard for though, and rarely does a game make you fight so hard for a fraction of a second\u2019s performance on a lap time. The overall difficulty could be placed somewhere between the brutal F1 2011 and the challenging F1 2010. \u201c Improvement is something you\u2019ll have to work hard for though, and rarely does a game make you fight so hard for a fraction of a second\u2019s performance on a lap time. The overall difficulty could be placed somewhere between the brutal F1 2011 and the challenging F1 2010 \u2013 not easy then. With even minute deviations from the track resulting in time penalties or outright disqualification, learning to control the cars properly will be your number one priority. Given just how specific the game\u2019s demands are though, there\u2019s temptation to become over-reliant on Codemaster\u2019s trademarked Flashback feature; zooming backwards to take one more pass at an awkward hairpin or avoid a collision. As such, it can become difficult to gauge any sense of genuinely improved performance. Throughout the game, vehicle handling proves simultaneously precise and punishing. Veering onto the grass causes the green stuff to accumulate on your wheels, adding a perceptible slide and minimises traction, while deploying KERS (strip back the complexity of the rules and it\u2019s a horsepower-boosting equivalent to a speed power-up in lesser titles) affects your braking times and accuracy as a side-effect of its eye-watering forward momentum. Thankfully, with a range of braking assists, traction control and a racing guideline available, F1 2012 remains accessible for newcomers who want something perhaps closer to a typical racing game but still serving as an entry point to the sport. Ramp the difficulty up though, and every turn of the car, every gear change, and even aspects of pit time are your responsibility. That responsibility is even felt prior to races, with your car\u2019s customisations \u2013 best tires, engine optimisations, fuel types \u2013 largely determining victory before you\u2019ve even hit the tarmac. It\u2019s more to learn and can feel frustrating if you just want to jump into a game, but the results really pay off once you know what you\u2019re doing.  Moving into the main game content, the Proving Grounds area feels closest to an Arcade mode and is likely to be where more casual players spend a lot of their time. Champions Mode offers a selection of six challenges seeing you outwit and out-race some of the biggest names in the sport, and is immediately more accessible than the career or even the quick play modes. The difficulty curve on these is blistering though, and as you put yourself through races spotlighting Formula One\u2019s finest, you'll find yourself having to put every speck of training you've gathered from elsewhere in the game to its utmost use. Proving Grounds is also where you will find the Time attack and Time Trial modes, the former seeing you attempting to set speed records on some of the world\u2019s top racetracks, the latter testing your racing skills against the demands of international race teams. The difficulty curve on these is blistering though, and as you put yourself through races spotlighting Formula One\u2019s finest, you'll find yourself having to put every speck of training you've gathered from elsewhere in the game to its utmost use. \u201c While these more casual modes allow you free reign to select racing team and cars, the full Career Mode instead sees you racing up the league tables, beginning with a lower tier team before your successes earn you promotion after promotion. Impress the global press and industry observers and you\u2019ll attract contract offers from more prestigious teams, your choices of which to accept affecting progression. It\u2019s a lengthy outing, though the new Season Challenge mode allows a more relaxed approach, still putting you through the paces of a competitive chain of races but proving less of a time demand than your full career. In addition to expected online multiplayer, split-screen and LAN options make welcome appearances. With no noticeable decline in frame rates or overall visual quality in split screen, the chance for some deliciously tense competition with your real-world mates is one to be relished. Visually, the improvements in F1 2012 are harder to spot \u2013 2011 already looked amazing. Most notable is a refined weather system, where rain can, and frequently will, sweep across a track during weekend-long events. Storm clouds are visible from a distance, and the look of the track as it gets soaked is perceptible. Best of all, this forces a gameplay change, as you\u2019ll need to switch out tires to continue at optimum efficiency. Racetracks new and old \u2013 the main attraction being the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, hosting this year\u2019s US Grand Prix \u2013 are authentically modelled, each delivering a unique atmosphere and, as with last year\u2019s entry, there\u2019s a brilliant soundtrack to accompany you. Essentially, if you enjoyed F1 2011, there\u2019s more than enough here to keep your attention: everything that was great last year returns, with enough tweaks and improvements to warrant a return. Newcomers will find F1 2012 a shock to the system compared to more conventional racing games, but the ample tools provided to get into the sport provide a gratifying experience with just a little bit of commitment on the player\u2019s part. While Formula One is a racing sport, F1 2012 is far more than just a racing game. Equal parts simulation and re-creation of the real world events, Codemasters Birmingham has done a magnificent job of capturing the precision of the vehicles and the excitement of individual events. It's a title that demands skill and tactics over thoughtless speeding, and as such will likely lose the interest of less committed players. For those willing to play by the rules, there\u2019s an amazing wealth of content to be found here \u2013 easily Codemasters\u2019 finest Formula One outing."

        "Content": "My Iroquois nation spreads across the world quickly, being likened to plague by my enemies. In real life, this relatively small group of people was all but wiped out by the end of the 20th century, but in my game, they are a force to be reckoned with -- a nation wresting control of the seas with modern navies, and taking cities by force with infantry and tanks. Manifest Destiny takes on a whole new meaning; by 2010, I've slowly but surely conquered the Americans and other European nations, subduing them to my rule... or simply burning their once-haughty nations to ashes.  This is what Civilization V is all about.    It's a turn-based strategy game based around building up a selected society into a world power. And, yes, Civilization V can look seriously boring to the casual bystander, but for the person at the helm of the game each turn can lead to a weighty decision, giving the player a certain feeling of power that few, if any, games match.  Civilization has no campaign, instead it simply allows the players to create a world of their devising and jump right into it either by themselves or with others in multiplayer. The biggest choice a player will make is what civilization they're going to play. Each civilization is led by a great leader from history, and gets a few special benefits and units, so its' important to consider what type of victory you're out to achieve before setting your nationality. For instance the French get cultural bonuses that give them a huge bonus towards a cultural victory, while playing Germany will give players access to powerful military units like the Panzer tank that can aid in taking over the world by force. Of course you can always pick a military-focused leader and take them on a route towards a cultural victory, but this will also present a greater challenge.   Hexagons in Civ V make for more natural unit movement. Besides picking a nation, players can further customize their scenario by switching between options such as whether the world will be made of several continents or not, what era they start in (Civ moves in eras, such as Medieval, Renaissance, etc., which also influences the level of technology you have access to), and how many other civilizations they wish to compete with. It essentially makes for infinite replayability, giving players a simple tool set to craft the challenge they want in of the world over and over again.  And hell yes, this is the type of game that you want to just play over and over. Like its predecessors, Civilization V is amazingly addictive, with games commonly drawing more than five or six hours out of me in a single sitting. The reason? Because win or lose, Civilization V allows players to guide an entire society and craft their own story, taking them from the dawn of history and far into the future. I love taking the Japanese and making them into a peaceful country who wants nothing more than to make Opera houses and win over their neighbors via their culture, or take the Aztecs and fashion them into a powerful imperialistic nation that is completely fascist and obsessed with world domination. Civilization V really is what you make of it, and for me it's a good way to tell alternate stories about some of history's most interesting nations.  I say Civilization V is only \"good\" -- and not \"great,\" as I would have said about Civilization IV -- at crafting stories because I feel like the game's taken away some pretty important tools for customizing your society. In Civilization IV players could force things on their country and opposing nations in the form of religions and government. In Civilization V, though, players gather up \"culture\" as a resource, spending it every so many turns on \"policies\" that give their civilization bonuses. For instance a player might choose to put policy points into the \"Piety\" tree, giving their nation a boost to happiness and forcing them to accept an unnamed religion. I really appreciate the way the various policy trees give players a wide array of customization options for their nation, but I miss the power and ridiculous glee I got out doing things like forcing Judaism down the throats of my enemies because my Jewish Japanese empire was out to win owning the hearts and minds of my neighbors.     I could try to argue that the new city-state feature in Civilization V makes up for the lack of clearly defined religious and governmental institutions, but sadly I'd be lying. City-states are single city nations that players can either make allies of, ignore, or attack and take over. Gaining their favor grants your society access to their goods and gives you another loyal sword should your nation go to war, but ultimately I found the limited interaction I had with them pretty boring. Sure, it's fun to make a city-state that borders the opposite side of my enemy's nation an ally, watching as they attack them on their flank, but you can't do much else with them. Still, I guess I do kind of get a sick bit of pleasure of even mildly  manipulating lesser powers to achieve victory\u2026   Eventually battles use everything from cannons to robots. Winning, actually, is where one of Civilization V's weaknesses come to light. While players can win through either diplomacy (via building the United Nations and being elected the leader), conquest (by taking out all other nations), science (by building a space ship and launching it), culture (by completing five of the policy tree branches), or by having the biggest score in the year 2050, in all the games I played it seemed it was overly difficult to get anything but a timed or military victory against the AI when starting from the earliest period. The AI is simply far too aggressive once they're on your borders, and no amount of gifts or other concessions would keep them from deciding to attack me. Attacking would then force me to focus on my military, taking my cities' production away from building the other scientific or cultural items I needed to win. It's more than a little annoying to play for ten or more hours only to realize that the victory you've been working towards is going to be thwarted by a belligerent computer player. I mean, look, I'm all for the blood of nations on my hands, but sometimes I like to be peaceful too, you know?  Still, if combat is what you're looking for, Civilization V has it in spades, and it's better than ever. In past Civilization games you could \"stack\" enemies on a space on the board, allowing you to make gigantic armies that players had to smash against one another turn after turn -- with results only really savvy strategy players seemed to fully comprehend. Civ V , on the other hand, doesn't allow stacking at all, forcing players to use more strategy than ever. With hexagon-shaped tiles making up the board, players now maneuver fewer units so that they can surround enemy forces, or use powerful units to choke off key points like mountain passes. Ranged units can also now fire over other units, making players carefully consider every army formation. As a result, combat is vastly more satisfying than it has ever been, feeling much more like a game of chess than a simple game of my-numbers-bigger-than-yours.    Combat is just one example of how Civilization V improves the franchise, with a host of other significant changes making this the most approachable the series has ever been. For instance take the advisor system. Like the console title Civilization Revolution (and other past Civilization games for PC), players have access to a set of advisors. These advisors specialize in various branches of nation building such as military and economics, and are available at any time for players confused about how to proceed. Moreover, each time a player chooses a new construction for their city, they can easily identify which building or unit their advisors think is pertinent thanks to symbols sitting next to the options. Every place the player looks in Civ V there's helpful tips on how to proceed, as well as in depth in-game \"civlopedia\" that easily allows players to find most any detail they could need in a given moment.  Every menu or interaction in Civ V is more intuitive and helpful -- a testament to the lessons learned by a developer that's been making these games for almost two decades.  Years of experience has helped developer Firaxis understand their audience more than ever, and they've included tools in Civilization V that are going to make the community aspect of it accessible to casual players. Civilization has always had an active modding community, but unless you were knowledgeable enough about where to look and how to make them function, you probably never played any of them. In Civilization V the mods are in the main menu of the game, with players empowered with the ability to create, share, download and install mods with just a few clicks of a button. Creating and playing out your own stories is fun, but I for one think that it'll be a blast getting to enjoy unique scenarios crafted by other players. "

Monster Hunter Tri is one such historical abnormality. It just shouldn't be possible \u2013 it brings hard-core MMO-style gaming to a casual console, and stunning graphics to the most notoriously underpowered games machine of this generation.  For those who know the series inside out, Tri achieves something even more remarkable: it's a reboot that preserves the core gameplay elements of the series, yet rearranges everything else in entirely unexpected ways. The more time you've clocked on Monster Hunter, the more Tri will seem like an all-new experience.   I'm pretty sure that one's known as the Bloodbottler. Thankfully you can weaken it by tricking it into eating a Snozzcumber.  The basic mission structure is unchanged: within a generous time limit you're free to roam over vast slabs of fantastical primeval wilderness, plundering natural resources, skinning the wildlife, or just admiring the scenery. Only now the reptilian rulers of this absurd animal kingdom have more complex, and more fluid attack patterns... and so do you. All the returning weapons classes have new attacks and more complex combos.  Even the lowliest boss in the game, an over-sized purple Velociraptor called the Great Jaggi, can really keep you on your toes, with sideways body-slams that seem to reach half way across the map. And even the most maligned weapon class, the Sword & Shield combo, has some impressive new tricks, like a stun-inducing shield bash move.  The elemental attacks dealt out by monsters are far more devastating in Tri. For instance, get hit by a fireball, and you'll get 'Fire Blight,' also known as 'Being On Fire.' Diving into a body of water is enough to cure this condition, but the best defence is to avoid getting hit in the first place. This is achieved by observing monster behaviour closely, ever-ready to roll out of the way. Speaking of water, fighting in the newly-introduced underwater stages is an entertaining diversion, as you have to adopt a more ponderous, deliberate play style.   Elf needs food - badly!  Between missions, when you're chilling in the offline village of Moga or the online city shards of Loc Lac, every aspect of resource management has been streamlined to within an inch of its life. A great example is how farming is handled in Tri. As with every game in the series to date, resources in this fantasy world are scarce. Players must be both hunters & collectors, and gather resources in the field: mushrooms and herbs to mix potions, ores to forge armour and weapons, and fish to create, er, ammunition. When venturing out on a quest, it's always wise to take a pickaxe and a bugnet, in case you spy any juicy resource spots. For while there's a farm linked to the central hub zone that provides a steady supply of goodies, they now come at a price.  In the last game, farming was free, yet time-consuming. A full sweep of Pokke Farm could take you a good five minutes, sapping precious moments from your hunting schedule. Now you have a team of Felynes (mischievous kitty-cat people) to do your farming for you, cutting the procedure down to mere seconds. Likewise, the Moga fishing fleet is at your disposal, eager to venture out in search of fish or sunken treasure \u2013 these subcontractors can even go hunting monsters for you, and deliver low-level carves straight to your item box. Yet all these services cost Resource Points, and Resource Points aren't free.   Hence the introduction of free-form hunting. In addition to venturing out on any of the structured Guild missions, there's always the option of simply wandering into the nearby Moga Woods map and doing whatever you please: carving the horns off deer, foraging for dino-dung (a fabulous fertiliser), and slaying the boss monsters that roam randomly through the map. The further you progress in single player, the deadlier the free-range monsters you run into, and the more Resource Points you'll get for slaying them. Every kill adds to your tally; time spent massacring docile herbivores is never time wasted.  Combine this time limit-free ad-hoc hunting with a bit of gathering from resource points that randomly re-spawn as you play, and you have a fairly relaxing alternative to the strict, merciless victory conditions imposed by the Guild.  Another stress-reducing feature is the introduction of secondary mission objectives. By giving you the option of ending a quest once you've completed one of these minor tasks \u2013 like, say, severing a monster's tail \u2013 you can now bail out of a quest with a skerrick of your pride intact. It's a handy option for when you run out of potions, pack the wrong equipment, or simply find yourself outclassed by the latest walking freakshow you've signed on to eviscerate.   Fleshlumpeaters put up one hell of a fight.  In Monster Hunter Freedom Unite , micro-managing your small workforce of buff-cooking chefs and AI co-op buddies was an ordeal. Now there is only one of each, and both are far more versatile and effective. Better yet, you spend around 80% less time stuffing around with them, which in turn frees up more time for hunting. You no longer have the option of paying a chef to cook your stamina-boosting steaks for you in bulk, but the all-new double spit-roast accessory lets you cook them yourself in a fraction of the time.  The single-player mode is substantial. Even a determined, skilled player will most likely take weeks to burn through to the final boss, and if you wish to collect most or all of the sets of armour and weapons, then you're guaranteed months of happy grinding as you re-do missions to get all the materials. High-Rank equipment will often need to be made from carves with 5%, or even 2% drop rates, and that means hunting dozens and dozens of wyverns. Likewise, you'll need stacks of coins from the Arena Mode to craft certain rare sets of armour; a good an excuse as any for marathon split-screen sessions.  Tri's true longevity will most likely lie in the online mode. While there are quests of every rank available at all times, there is also a rotating selection of special Event Quests, with rewards that go towards an exclusive tier of goodies, including a pair of enchanted leather pants. More importantly, playing co-op with other humans truly brings the game to life. Whether your hunting squad is running like a well-oiled machine, or you're all screaming abuse at the one guy who keeps dying, the unpredictable nature of play always make co-op feel like an occasion.   An underwater fight against the Gizzardgulper. "

        "Score": 9.0,
        "id": "f5091da73b54df14ab0f9ca41992d57d",
        "Content": "It's been a long time coming, but the next numbered instalment in the Street Fighter series is finally here, and it's wonderful. As anyone who has visited an arcade in the last six months would know, Street Fighter IV (SFIV) represents a vital reinvention of the series. We love 2D and we love Street Fighter III, but the implementation of the new visual style and more accessible gameplay in SFIV is close to flawless.  Now, normally 'accessible' is seen a danger word in the world of videogames. Most people assume it's a synonym of 'dumbed down'. If something is accessible it can surely only be enjoyed by noobs or 'casual' players, whoever they are. In Street Fighter IV, however, accessibility is not at the expense of depth \u2013 far from it. This is a game to be played and mastered over months or years, not hours. What it does mean is that the game doesn't get too bogged down in technical play and precision input that only the top players will be able to enjoy. The timing and motions on inputs required for special moves are just that little bit more relaxed than in previous titles, for instance. What this means is that you can concentrate more on when you're going to unleash a certain move as opposed to simply getting the movement out. Another example is the fact that the parry system has been discarded. As amazing as it was for advanced players, this is not a game in which you'll need to master the frame perfect art of tapping forward to parry. This also ties in with a slightly more measured pace, which helps make the game feel less twitchy and more rhythmic.   We love SFIII's visuals, but daaaaamn.  The team has created a fantastic set of mechanics, too. Several return from Street Fighter III, while new inclusions help round out the gameplay. In terms of returning mechanics, the EX system is back, and we couldn't be happier. The basic idea is that you can modify any special move into an EX version which does more hits and/or changes the attack animation. Doing this uses up one of the four segments on your super bar, so it gives you an alternative to waiting for your super bar to be completely full \u2013 you can portion out modified moves any time you have a segment ready to go. The best part is that executing these moves is simplicity itself \u2013 instead of hitting one punch or one kick for a special, hit two. BAM. Suddenly Ken's fireball does two hits, his dragon punch does four and his spinning kick launches faster, goes further and also does more hits.  For other characters EX moves can be more modified. Crimson Viper's Thunder Knuckle, for instance, crosses over the opponent in EX form, while her Seisumo Hammer will track the opponent (the normal version, which is a ground pound, requires the player to judge an opponent's distance and use light for close, medium for mid-range and heavy for further away).  Another system that returns (from SFIII: 3rd Strike) is tapping light punch and light kick to throw. It's simple, easy to execute and ties in wonderfully with one of the new systems \u2013 focus attacks. Every character has a focus attack and it's executed with medium punch and medium kick (you can tap them or hold them to charge it up). While charging you can block one attack, and then counter-attack when you release or it's fully charged (which is then unblockable). Hitting an opponent with a charged focus attack stuns them, dropping them to their knees and allowing you to get another attack in. Again, focus attacks are simplicity themselves to execute, but add a vital tactical option for both basic and advanced play. Oh, and they look awesome too \u2013 we particularly love the ink sprays as they launch.   He got focus attacked here, here and here... worst I've ever seen.  Focus attacks can be countered with throws and armour-breaking moves, and you can also do cool things like dash cancel them mid-charge to counter an opponent's expectations, or use focus attacks to cancel out of a number of regular/special moves... which you can then dash cancel out of and into another move. We'll be brutally honest \u2013 we don't use a lot of the most advanced play options. We're good at Street Fighter, but our play styles are still extensions of when we learnt to play back on the original SFII arcade cabinet. And that's why SFIV is such a success \u2013 it has incredible appeal for all types of players. If you want to play it like World Warrior, you can, and if you want to get technical with super cancels, cross-ups, EX focus moves and other combo boosting technical techniques, you can. There's incredible subtlety and nuance to the combo system and to the gameplay overall.  And for once, the game is prepared to teach you its secrets. Yes, Street Fighter IV has a robust set of challenges (five sets of challenges for 'normal' difficulty and five for 'hard'... which is something of an understatement) designed to teach you everything from basic throws and specials through to super cancels and seriously advanced combos. It's a great insight into what's possible with each character... and will make you respect the top players all the more.   An ultra move? Or Vega's revenge after Ryu called him M.Bison?  Oh, there's one other new gameplay addition we should mention \u2013 ultra moves. You now have a revenge metre in addition to your super bar, which builds up as you take punishment. Once it's glowing you're able to unleash a devastating ultra \u2013 essentially a super move on huge amounts of steroids. These are basically the coolest moves in the game, and reflect \u2013 again \u2013 the game's ambition to let everyone compete. What could be fairer to level the playing field when someone is getting beaten than giving them access to an insanely powerful attack? These are executed in the same way as a character's super, only with all three punch or all three kick buttons. Check out some of the videos on the site to see what they're like, but they're all \u2013 bar none \u2013 spectacular. Sakura knocks her opponent high into the air, jumps up after them and smacks them down with both fists, before stomping them into the ground from on high. Crimson Viper ground pounds her opponent into the air then follows them up with a series of flaming flip kicks. Ken brutalises his opponent with a flurry of airborne kicks before unleashing a devastating dragon punch high into the sky.   Ultra moves aren't just a reflection of SFIV's quest for drama; for battles where impossible comebacks are not only possible but expected , they're also a reflection of the game's whole aesthetic - big, bold and larger than life, with a chunky, comic book-inspired visual style. The characters in this game are massive, their strength and/or speed palpable. Movements and fireballs send up clouds of dust from the earth, hits trigger flashes and sparking explosions on impact, motion blur exaggerates certain movements and ink splashes during focus attacks. The animations are simply gorgeous - this is 2D artistry with 3D characters. You only have to watch a character like Fei-Long to see the poise of his movements, the way his silhouette is used to convey power and discipline, the way he bounces on his toes, his feet perfectly arched. Characters have a subtle black outline around them too, to give them definition, while the texture work is very much a soft, painted style, again helping the comic book tone. It's all complemented by great attention to detail \u2013 each character visually tracks their opponent as he or she jumps and blocks, while big hits are accompanied by grimaces and popping eyes.   Frame your way through this vid - it's incredible.  If there's a weakness in Street Fighter IV's visuals, it's the backgrounds. Now, by their very nature they can't be obtrusive, but we're still a little disappointed by how boring a lot of them are. Hey look! It's an empty airfield! Woo! It's a distillery! Hooray! Oh look, it's a group of weirdly gurning, poorly animated background people! And so on. It's not a big deal, but definitely doesn't impress the way the rest of the visuals do.  SFIV has a hugely impressive line-up of characters. SFIII's newcomers have been left by the wayside, to be replaced by a classic Streeties line-up. We're talking Ken, Ryu, Guile, Chun-Li, Zangief, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Blanka, M. Bison, Vega, Sagat, Balrog, Cammy, Fei-Long, Dan, Rose, Sakura, Gen and Akuma. They all look fantastic in 3D, and by and large feel just as you'd expect. The new characters \u2013 Abel, El Fuerte, Rufus, Crimson Viper, Gouken and Seth are by and large great too. We're not huge fans of Seth (can anyone say gimmicky ?) or El Fuerte, but the others really add to the roster. We love Abel's strength in grappling, his evasive roll, his flowing combos. We love Rufus' acrobatic twirl, his unpredictable flying kick combos and his whole attitude, even if we think he's the ugliest character in the game. We love Crimson Viper's four variations on her Thunder Knuckle and trying to master the use of her Burning Kick special. Gouken (Ken and Ryu's former trainer and Akuma's elder brother apparently) has devastating launching palm strikes, angled and flat fireballs and a spinning kick that launches straight up. He just exudes power. It's a killer selection of characters.   Ken and El Fuerte's vaudevillian double act is coming along, no doubt about it.  The area that Street Fighter games generally fall down in when they make their way to home consoles, is the new modes. Or lack thereof. Street Fighter IV doesn't excel in this area but it's more than adequate. As mentioned earlier, the Challenge mode contains some excellent training challenges (against Dan no less \u2013 the ultimate punching bag), but it also has normal and hard sets of Time Attacks, and normal and hard sets of Survival mode. In both, you start out on the first level with a serious advantage (defence up, auto heal, infinite gauges for you, no block, no UC and no SC for opponents) which gets whittled away the further in you get.  The Training mode is also really robust, allowing you to practise your moves against an opponent that's doing exactly what you need. You can even record a sequence of moves for your opponent and then get them played back on a loop. And then there's online... which, well, we haven't been able to test locally. Thankfully our US compatriots have , so pop on over and read their review . The long and the short \u2013 it's pretty decent. We can't wait to be challenged by other players while in the Arcade mode either.  To be honest, we would have liked to see some kind of more involved mode included. Something along the lines of the World Tour mode in Alpha 3 for PSone, for instance, which sent you around the world to fight in battles with specific parameters (i.e. you could only do damager with specials). We're also disappointed that the Replay mode \u2013 a vital inclusion to be frank \u2013 didn't make it in time for launch. It will be available post-launch, but it's a worrying trend to leave out such an important aspect from the retail release.   Rufus - not the most attractive outfit around, but his quips after fights are pretty hilarious. "

        "Score": 9.0,
        "id": "b284dec2234e9f1db9576120c3041db9",
        "Content": "Spore doesn't achieve the seamless evolutionary process and absolute player expression it first promised. What it turns out to be is something quite different altogether, a bizarre experiment of ideas that, incredibly, focus into something truly remarkable. Spore isn't what anyone thought it would be, but it's still a triumph.  The platitudes and criticisms can come later, though: first, the facts. Spore's brief is that you climb a custom-made beastie up the evolutionary ladder, from cellular pipsqueak to land-walking animal to tribal half-wit to civilised sentient and finally to space-faring ultra-being. Along the way you're tailoring your creature's appearance, behaviour, costuming and eventually vehicles and cities. While your experiences may mirror another player's, your sights most definitely won't. Spanky procedural generation tech sees the way your creations move and communicate depend on their design. Stick eight legs on it and it'll walk totally differently to a six-legged creature -- and even to an eight-legged creature with its limbs placed differently. Clearly it's the game's under-the-hood tech that's making this happen, but crucially it adds to that sense that you've made something.   There's always a bigger fish. Which you get to kill and eat later.  Spore's zones, cities and planets aren't solely populated by your creations. It'll pluck the masterpieces of friends and strangers alike from the web and bung 'em into your game (unless you tell it not to), so the vast universe is teeming with unique faces to discover, befriend or battle. It's no MMO though -- it's strictly the designs that make it into your game, not the players themselves.  Structurally, Spore's split into five distinct stages and it's here that its most fundamental problem lies. The first time you play through, at least until you get to the fifth, galactic stage, you'll be confused and disappointed: it's a sequence of fairly dissociated mini-games, like you've bought a Wii party game by mistake. The rules of play change at each stage and they seem brief and crude -- just standalone ideas rather than part of a cohesive masterplan. As it transpires, it's not quite that simple. There's a definite bigger picture, but you only really see it once you've spent some time in space and then come back right to the start with a brand new creature. As well as the jarring jump between stages, the total lack of an autosave is infuriating and bewildering in this kind of game. It's not a huge issue in the early, briefer stages, but a random, one-off crash during the space stage cost us four hours of progress. There were tears.  The first two stages are at least fairly charming. The first, Cell, is akin to flOw on PS3/PSP -- a pretty simple affair of swimming and eating to increase your size and, occasionally, gain new abilities. For all its tranquillity, it seems throwaway and it is -- but that's at least partly because it's a tutorial in disguise. Spore is, after all, trying to attract an audience beyond traditional PC gamers -- the Sims audience, to be specific -- so it needs a gentle way to break them in. The Cell stage does have its own merits but what it's really there for is to train a total newcomer in movement, collection, combat and customisation -- four of the pillars the game as a whole is built upon.   Fruit picking: that's why we're all so interested in Spore, right?  At every stage of the game, while it may feel totally different, you're doing those things -- but in an increasingly elaborate fashion. The top-down, pseudo-2D Cell stage segues into the fully 3D Creature stage, which introduces the fifth pillar -- diplomacy. You can fight or befriend other species -- the former perhaps quicker and more tempting, but the rewards lesser. Peaceful communication, meanwhile, is a matter of Simon Says gesture replication. It's a little annoying, but it's not your concern here -- what you're interested in is acquiring new creature parts. You're roaming what feels like a vast continent, meeting new species and attempting to recruit them to your cause or brutally eradicate them.  Either way, you win new hands, eyes, feet, weapons and decorations, each of which affects your creature's abilities. It's a sort of Pokemon/Diablo mash-up: gotta catch 'em all meets obsessive looting. And it works, making Creature the stage you're most likely to come back to (outside of Space, more on which shortly).   While you could just skip straight to a later stage and build your beast from the complete roster of available parts, this way it feels even more personal -- you're creating something based on stuff you've found yourself. Again, this thinking runs throughout the stages -- you're not presented with everything, but rather you seek out parts and upgrades yourself. At times you'll think \"but why can't I just add face-tentacles if I want?\" or, indeed, \"why can't I paint that entire planet blue?\", but it's an impetus to continue. Without it it's possible you'd create the most elaborate, enthusiastic designs the game allows, and then just drop it, sated. Not that you're particularly restricted -- you've got free reign when it comes to creating costumes, buildings, vehicles and spaceships. You want to stick three top hats, a giant moustache and a steam valve onto your insectoid snake-beast with seven eyes? No one's gonna stop you.   You might not be able to do much with your cities, but at least your creatures get to play Wheel of Fortune.  The two stages that follow Creature are comfortably Spore's weakest and you really do need to fight through the sense of doom and disappointment: there's a prize at the end of it. Tribal is a watered-down Age of Empires job, a mini-RTS that's low on self expression and heavy on cheerless resource gathering. There's simply not much flexibility or flair to it, which means it's a relief that it's over so quickly -- you can blast through in less than an hour.  The following Civilization stage is a tougher one to call. Similarly, it's based on real-time strategy, though this time halfway between Command & Conquer and, unsurprisingly, Civilization. You're collecting spice, building vehicles and capturing rival cities, all with one aim: ruling your home planet. While visually spectacular, it's fairly simple stuff, and though you have the choice to conquer by warfare, by economic clout or by religious sway, in practice each plays out too similarly. It's a lot more engaging than the paper-thin tribal stage but still a little damp. It's got two things going for it -- firstly, it's all a setup for what follows. Secondly, it's your chance to create land, sea and air vehicles and buildings for your cities. While you can't be quite as outlandish as with the organic mayhem of the creature creator, it nails the LEGO feel, and indeed the Sims feel. The most grating let-down is the cities -- there are only four types of buildings and no matter what you build it's all laid out within this plain, thick-bordered circle that ends up homogenising the whole thing to a certain extent.  It's the area of the game that most feels as though it needs an expansion, one where you do more with your creatures' homes and lives. There's room to squeeze an entire Sims-like sub-game in there, in fact.   You only really see the effects of your town-tinkering while you're town-tinkering.  And so to space. Finally, Spore stops being mini-games and becomes a game -- a massive, elaborate and surprisingly hardcore game. It's a kind of cartoon Elite, roaming an astonishingly huge universe at will, meeting countless new species, colonising new planets, trading, waging war, performing quests and remaking worlds. It's maximalist gaming, shoving in an incredible amount of ideas whilst keeping the interface simple. While you're given a purpose of sorts, and a potential nemesis, what space is really about is applying what you're learned and done before now on a mass scale.   On each planet you colonise, you can create new vehicles and new buildings, though there's no more direct control of them. You can seed planets with new life, or eradicate existing species. You can artificially uplift backwards races so that they become another space-faring force to interact with, or you could simply terrify them for kicks. There's an amazing random moment in the earlier stages where you're pottering about eating fruit off bushes or locking horns with other dumb beasts, and suddenly the skies go dark. Overhead, something impossibly huge appears. Every creature around you panics and scatters, but you stare upwards in awe. You, the player, can identify it as a spaceship, but at the same time it's so far beyond your realm of experience that it's hard to rationalise it. It completely throws you, but it's a sublime hint as to what's to come.   Fighting in the Civ stage eventually escalates to nukes and mass hypnosis.  Because now you're that spaceship, travelling across a landmass that once took minutes to cross in mere seconds, almost oblivious to the tiny, terrified beasts below. Fly down close and you'll notice it's all there. The carnivores eat the herbivores, the tribal species hunt and fish, the civilised species are diligently farming spice to sell. It's a shame you're kept at arm's length from controlling this stuff again yourself once you're in space, but finally, Spore makes sense, and it seems like one grand plan after all.  Space is a bit of a grind at first -- cash is a little too hard to come by, but you need huge gobbets of it to afford the really awesome toys. It's going to present quite the obstacle for casual players, who may be so daunted that they stick to tooling around with the various creation tools. Once you're past a few hours of uphill struggle and diligent diplomacy or destruction, however, you reach Spore's unspoken sixth stage -- you become a god. With a click of your mouse, barren planets become verdant wonderlands, the very skies and seas change colour, mountains appear where once were valleys, crystal fields and emerald rivers split the land, species find themselves changed and evolved.   Spore really knows what it's doing in the Space stage - you'll regularly coo at scenes like this.  Or, indeed, entire worlds are wiped from existence. For all its enormity, it's where Spore's heritage as a follow-up to the Sims is most evident: you've graduated from making people in your own image to reshaping the entire universe. A universe, critically, that will be endlessly restocked with the creations of friends and strangers."

It's where newcomers are enthusiastically welcomed, contrary to other Western stories where folks \"not from around these parts\" are met with suspicion. It's got plenty of Western staples though; a ranch managed by a salt-of-the-earth family (even if the husband is a little unhinged), a cute main street with a saloon and general store, plenty of lovely Western accents, and of course, a touch of danger. My Time at Sandrock is an excellent entry in an ever-growing list of cozy games, consistently fun while managing to stand apart from the crowd thanks to its theme of optimism grown out of hard times. As a sequel to the post-apocalyptic RPG town sim My Time at Portia, the desert-based follow-up My Time at Sandrock is deeply familiar. Like its predecessor, you've come to this struggling town to assist in improving and growing it by building items and relationships. Learning to build an efficient workshop was a great joy, and I'm proud of how I can take on townie requests and build main story items with relative ease by the end of the 75 hours I\u2019ve spent with it so far. What we said about My Time at Portia My time at Portia is, first and foremost, a game about building, and I've had a great time doing it. From mining to taming wild llamas to dating, there\u2019s a lot to do here, and I\u2019m still discovering and unlocking new and usually interesting things. While each of its parts is lacking in some way or have annoying audio bugs, when you put them all together they bolster each other to add up to something fun. I look forward to seeing how My Time at Portia continues to evolve in the future. - Miranda Sanchez, Jan 29, 2019 Score: 8 Read the full My Time at Portia review . Along the way you\u2019ll have to gather resources, use those resources to build specific items for main story quests, side quests, or optional commissions, and then use the money earned (combined with the increased prestige of your workshop) to invest in better equipment to make even more items. It can be a grind early on, but it's just the calm kind of grind I'm looking for in these games. Progression is steady both in terms of new quests and new things to create, which meant I never lost interest. Resource gathering starts with digging through scrap piles and kicking trees, eventually working up to diving into old world ruins that are generally safe apart from the occasional trap. Mining is once again a relaxing and quiet activity that has an added drop of excitement thanks to a special rat enemy that appears at random when breaking an object. If it's slain, it'll drop gold and other valuable rewards. I appreciate that this wrinkle kept me on my toes without interrupting the flow of mining much. My Time at Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting \u201c Getting wood poses a unique challenge; as a city nestled in a desert plagued with sandstorms, keeping any deep-rooted plants alive is a priority for the townsfolk. With that in mind, cutting down any trees in Sandrock's city limits results in a fine for offenders and damages relationships with townsfolk. It's one of several ways Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting. I may have accidentally forgotten this once, leaving me with a warning from a cheery but concerned member of the church. The stump of the tree I almost destroyed still stands just outside my workshop as a good reminder of my mistake. Sandrock's story has three main plotlines; one is about defending the town and general area from mutant lizards called Geeglers; another is about discovering how to reverse the desertification brought on by a \"relic rush\" that sucked the town dry of resources; and finally, a hunt for a bandit called Logan, a former child of the community who went bad after mysterious events. One of the three storylines is almost always active with maybe only few days of downtime between them, so they kept me busy. I was excited whenever a new thread began as it's hard to guess what storyline is going to kick up next. Do you like combat in your farm life games?

It got even more enticing as his actions against the town intensified. I love how almost everyone in the town has something new to say after a major story beat as well. As you'd imagine, most story objectives are completed by building new essential items and structures, like a new water tower, or occasionally going out and clearing out baddies from old world ruins. Combat in Sadrock is similar to Portia's in that it's still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system that's best in short encounters, which is what occurs most throughout Sandrock. Aiming down the sights of guns for an alternate third-person perspective is a nice addition, but doesn't drastically improve a given fight. Dungeons in Sandrock are woefully straightforward and tend to err on the side of boring if you attempt to explore them in their entirety. Some enemies have interesting attack patterns and designs, including bosses, but with combat being so simple and my character being rather tanky, you\u2019re only ever in any real danger if you go into an area where you're drastically under-leveled. Combat is still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system. \u201c Sandrock allegedly boasts tons of weapons, but aside from boring throwing rocks, I only saw stronger variants of five melee options and two different guns. Finding a meaningful puzzle element or a new weapon for every forced dungeon crawl could have made them more appealing. There's an attempt to have side rooms with optional treasure chests, but exploring these dungeons to find every chest just doesn't feel worth it. Chests in dungeons and around the world rarely have anything of significant value, ranging from a small handful of money to a new food recipe. The latter is nice, but I'd prefer to get a unique clothing item, a new weapon, or maybe even a complex component that I could put toward a new project instead. In addition to the main story, there's a constant stream of side quests born out of the needs of the Sandrock residents. Some seem to happen based on the time of year, but most come from relationship benchmarks. Sandrock's residents are excellent, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface on a handful of their stories. Where Portia's residents could be dull or too stereotypical, I found Sandrock's residents to be vibrant. Plenty of residents have a mix of accents, including thick western ones that lend an air of authenticity to the Wild West setting. They lean on melodrama and iconic movie and TV references for humor, too, and it usually works well \u2013 yes, I did enjoy the mention of the knockoff Gundam show and reversals of iconic Star Wars quotes. But even so, the character writing is smart, both in being clever and going over my head when it came to some of the local researcher's in-depth science talk. My Time at Sandrock Screenshots 26 Images There's an impressive number people to meet too, with more than 45 friendable characters in Sandrock, and even more new townsfolk moving in as the story progresses. Occasional NPCs come through town for story beats as well and aren't necessarily available for friendship activities like gifting, but they add to the feel of Sandrock as a growing town worthy of people just passing through. Some of my favorite characters included a rancher named Cooper who has a knack for highly detailed rants that usually wind around the bend to end in an odd place. If you listen to his rants rather than choosing an option to fall asleep and skip them, you can even gain minor stat buffs, which was a funny surprise. Not every character is written to be friendly or chatty, though. Another one of my favorites, the doctor Fang, hardly talks at all and instead lets his raven X speak for him. He doesn't even accept gifts until you're able to convince him otherwise through persistence and eventual side quests. The side quests in question are almost always about a character's background or ambitions, or both, and there wasn't a single one I felt was a waste of time. Completing some side quests is the only way to get access to new minigames and activities in Sandrock. Doing these extra tasks earns relationship points with the involved parties, which in turn leads to new dialogue lines, bonuses like the occasional gift or shop discounts, and the potential chance for romance. There are a whopping 21 romanceable characters in Sandrock and I'll admit it was hard to choose one person to woo. Getting closer to a character isn't only an opportunity to get an extra hand at your workshop in the future, but also leads to special relationship quests. Though it can take a bit of time to build up to friendship through gifting, daily chats, and completing quests or commissions, Sandrock does a stellar job with this system and relationship progress feels much faster than Portia's. I appreciated the extra challenge managing water brought. \u201c Aside from the obvious difference of featuring new characters, another major change from Portia to Sandrock is how the desert setting plays into the town's economy and other challenges. I love how water is a focal point of not only the story but also the gameplay itself. Water is essential for running your workshop \u2013 if the water tank is empty, the machines don't work. Water can actually be crafted by gathering dew from shrubbery or using a dew collector, or barrels of water can purchased from Sandrock directly. However, if something like, say, the town bridge blows up resulting in no water being imported, water prices rise significantly. Though I didn't struggle too much with the water economy, I appreciated the extra challenge it brought when considering how I wanted to expand my workshop. For instance, when I was first introduced to farming, my other workshop machines were forced to a halt as I had to use all my stored water for the plants. Since then, I've been able to manage the water needs of plants and machines much better. Seasons impact water usage too, with the cool days of winter requiring significantly less water for your machines. There's even the occasional sandstorm that alters the residents' schedules, which also causes completed workshop items to blow away and a buildup of sand on machines that needs to be cleaned in order for them to work efficiently. In addition to the new setting, Sandrock has a great number of quality-of-life improvements, including better menus, icons above creatures to indicate whether or not they're friendly or hostile, free sprinting rather than limiting sprinting with a stamina bar, the ability to save and leave at any point rather than having to wait to go to sleep, and so much more. One of the biggest improvements is being able to build and complete item requests with items stored away in chests back at your workshop rather than needing them actively on hand. There are tons of items coming and going and getting processed into new things constantly, so not having to meticulously manage each was a huge relief. And in addition to crafting items, farming, taking care of animals, relationship building, sandfishing (fish live in sandpools here), cooking, decorating my house, and mining, there's even more to do with minigames. Some of these pop up during special holiday events, but there are also one-off games to play at almost any time at the local game center. My favorite was a simple whack-a-mole with various difficulty settings that could be played with NPCs or solo. Another great one requires you to find constellations in a star-filled night sky based on NPC requests. One of the unlockable sand racing minigames could use some tweaking to make the steering better, but I appreciate it as an option for multiplayer competitions. Sandrock is truly jampacked with choices, and like with Portia, they're almost all fun in short bursts as you jump between them. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front. \u201c There's even more to do on top of all that; there are tons of upgrades, including ones that I still don't have for my horse, for my mining jetpack and sensor goggles, and for various machines throughout my workshop. There are still romances I have to pursue (of people not even in the town yet too!), and many more side quests. Even with as many hours as I have played and all the quests I've done, I still don't have my four skill trees completed (gathering, workshop, combat, and social). That said, I do wish some of the skills were geared toward the endgame rather than the first dozen hours or so. In the gathering tree, one is specifically for digging in piles of junk for resources, which is something you only need to do in the opening few hours. I put my early points toward skills that got me more in the long run instead, so that dirt pile skill still sits unlearned. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front, too. On PC, assets and textures pop-in noticeably unless you manually go in and bump the settings to the highest options, which isn't ideal for a game with relatively low recommended PC specs. Xbox had similar issues as well, though the performance or quality mode didn't help with the asset loading much. While that is more of a minor annoyance and is easy to get used to, I've seen other persistent visual bugs. I've watched conversations happen through my character's skull, shrubs fly oddly in the sky, and other weird interactions. There hasn't been anything game breaking as far as I've seen, but I hope we see the sheer number of weird visual bugs get patched out over time. PC Co-Op Multiplayer  Where the campaign asks for your help in saving Sandrock from economic collapse, Sandrock's multiplayer asks for your help in building up Sandrock from its basics. While currently exclusive to the PC version, I was shocked at first to see places like the general store, scrap yard, and even the train station and train tracks were missing from Sandrock entirely. There are rockslides and junk blocking shortcuts through town, too. Up to four players can work together to clean up the town and determine what new facilities get built. Town planner progression is paced first by the group's workshop level and then by resources required to build the facility and its potential upgrades. So, like the campaign, building prestige for yourself as a builder allows you to access more. It's still a solid system and a neat spin on the campaign. New facilities also mean new people in town. I can see myself trying to convince friends to help prioritize unlocking the buildings for characters I like most from the campaign. Other key differences include removing the need for sleeping by a certain time. In the campaign, you pass out immediately if the clock hits 3:00 AM, but players can keep at it in multiplayer for as long as they want. It rocks. Better yet, there's an added nap function that can be used once per in-game day that quickly refills stamina and health. The skill trees are completely different as well, and there's an excellent daily task system and achievements not present in the campaign that can earn you extra money and experience. The three daily challenges reset after an in-game day, too, and are the same (but not shared) across all players. Players also have to share a plot of land and money and can share resources and contribute parts to build items.

There's even a board where you can leave messages to friends. I was also impressed by how difficulty in dungeons scale based on the number of people going in, and they did seem more challenging than in the campaign as a result. The chests in dungeons and around the world even have good loot, with fully built machinery and items that award stat bonuses to all when they're used as decor on workshop grounds. While I was only able to play a few hours of co-op multiplayer before this review, after my brief stint I'm determined to get lots more in. There's enough that's changed between multiplayer and the campaign to justify digging deep into both \u2013 besides, it's the perfect opportunity to choose a different person to romance, too."

The reality, however, is much different \u2013 Station to Station is more like a puzzle game built around some of the tropes of simulation-style games, with stuff like resource and money management unlocking the next possibility in the gameplay loop. It's disarmingly simple to explain: some of the buildings on your map are industries that produce resources. Connect those to the other buildings that need those resources. Connect them all to the cities. Profit. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask When everything is connected according to its needs and its ability to produce, you win. That's the game at its most basic. In other words, figure out how to connect everything that needs to be connected and you win. While it may not chug quite so deep into the nitty gritty of rail management, I found myself in love with its clever levels and gorgeous style nonetheless. If anything, the fact it's not what I expected added a layer of unexpected delight to my playthrough. That being said, even if I knew going into Station to Station exactly what is was about, it's just so charming and interesting I would still really enjoy it. The graphics, the pace, the atmosphere, the challenge, it just really appeals to me at the deepest levels of my gamer-being. Station to Station appeals to me at the deepest levels of my being. \u201c Station to Station bills itself as a \"relaxing and minimalist game about building railway connections,\" and I couldn't have said it better myself. There are six different \"worlds,\" for lack of a better term, each split into five or six different levels. The levels themselves vary in size, but they all take thematically from the world in which they're placed. For example, the \"Sunforge Sands\" and \"Golden Dunes\" worlds have you laying tracks in a desert biome, while Eveningstar Valley and Greendale are voxel-infused nods to the American west. These different themes don't really have much bearing on the puzzles themselves (other than a few bonus tasks I'll get to later). I would have liked to have seen some more environmental differences between the worlds, ones that have a real bearing on the strategy involved in solving each level. It seems like a bit of a lost opportunity. There are a few elements that matter in different biomes, like forests that you need to pay to remove in some levels and variation in cliff heights you need to take into account in others, but I would have liked to have seen even more. What's the Best Train Game? Train Sim World Series The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks Railroad Tycoon Series The A-Train Series Something else... let us know in the comments Answer See Results Voxel Urbana Station to Station's worlds are built using some of the most beautiful voxel art I\u2019ve seen since 3D Dot Game Heroes on PS3 (which I only mention because that game rules). The amazing 3D pixelated look is present in every part of the worlds, down to circling birds and wandering horses and dromedaries. These chunky little fellas are charming enough, but each city, town, and industry also get their own voxelated models that are pretty enough to make me wish my ashes could be spread inside the worlds of Station to Station when I die. Please, someone figure that out for me. The amazing 3D pixelated look is present in every part of the worlds. \u201c The heart-warming voxel models are wonderful in and of themselves, but the lighting in Station to Station takes the charm up even further. The rivers and lakes glisten in the sun, and there's a perpetual golden hour warmth to many of the levels. As you build out your tracks and link things together, the landscape begins to fill with color, with each connected industry spreading a golden ring of life from its place on the map. It's just so lovely. Each level is still beautiful even when none of the resources have been connected yet, but as you fill out the map it turns into an inviting, colorful world that seems to be wholly unconcerned with whether or not you're watching it. The trains move along their tracks and make their stops, the birds fly in the sky, and the other aforementioned animals wander about peacefully. I'd almost be content just floating around the map, zooming in and out to gaze at the architecture of the tiny buildings or watch a seagull make lazy figure-eights above it all even without the interesting rail management game that\u2019s layered on top of these little worlds. Rail Play I could gush about the look of Station to Station for pretty much the rest of this review, but only because it fits so damn perfectly with the style of gameplay behind it. Its puzzle-like stages feel almost like a board game brought to life by some kind wizard. The concept is pretty simple: you start each level with a few buildings on your map, and then connect them together so each resource connects with the building or city that needs it.  For example, in the second level in the Golden Dunes drops you into a map with a paper mill, a logging camp, and some water towers. The paper mill requires logs and water to make paper, so you're going to need to link those buildings together by adding a train station at each and then connecting those stations with a railway. The city itself needs water (among other things), so running a track from that line of interconnected stations will deliver the hydration the growing city needs. You're encouraged to link up your resources in non-logical ways with a \"stacking\" mechanic, which is a cool little twist that had me thinking outside the box\u2026car. In a nutshell, if your city needs tools, you'd make the connections almost in reverse order. Tools require a tool factory, which requires steel, which requires both coal and iron ore. Hook the coal and ore to the tool factory, hook the steel mill to the city, then run a freight line to the city and watch the bonuses stack up. Resources flow from one step in the process to the other and then the money flows into your coffers. It's almost as satisfying as winning the jackpot at a casino and watching chips come rushing out \u2013 and while that level of optimization isn\u2019t required, it\u2019s fun to try and hit Station to Station's cash-based bonus goal at the end of each level. Completing a level flush with cash isn't the only bonus goal, either. Each map has a Star goal to try your hand at, like completing a level with a stack worth $1200, for example. The main \"story,\" I guess you could call it, took me around eight hours to complete, but now I've turned my attention to replaying the levels more carefully in order to hit those bonus goals. I don\u2019t know if there's something special for completing them beyond a few additional achievements, but just going back and replaying the levels for the fun of those extra challenges is more than enough incentive for me. Unexpected failures never actually\u00a0frustrated me. \u201c Station to Station won\u2019t have you banging your head against a wall with its difficulty, but it does do an excellent job balancing the need to plan ahead with the need to think on your feet. You don't immediately start each level with each building in place: those open up only after you've hit a certain monetary goal that's different for every stage. So you might plan the perfect rail line from one resource to another and back to your city, only to discover that you now have to go over an existing rail line with a more expensive bridge to link up two newly unlocked map features. More than once I got near the end of a level and had to restart because I'd run out of money to build new rail lines \u2013 and yet those unexpected failures never actually  frustrated me. In fact, I felt a little sense of excitement when that would happen because it meant I got to play through the charming level again, only with the added benefit of hindsight. Station to Station also has a light card system that offers one-time boons to use, although the order you draw them doesn't seem to be randomized. You earn cards in the same way new buildings unlock, through the acquisition of money, and play them before finalizing a new railway. They can be things like \"Cheap Rails,\u201d which reduces the cost of the new rails, or \"Heavy Freight\" trains that will earn 50% more money on the given route. The Heavy Freight modifier is awesome when you have a huge stack of resources available, adding even more to that casino-like payout system. I really like this added layer of options, as they required me to make choices about when and where to spend my cards to maximize their benefits in addition to carefully laying out the railways between cities and resources. It's so simple in execution, but it gives a nice extra layer I appreciate. Seth's Game DNA These are the games that made me the gamer I game game game. See All Super Mario Bros. Nintendo Super Mario World Nintendo EAD Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo EAD Final Fantasy Square Final Fantasy VI Square Final Fantasy IX Square Final Fantasy VII Square Final Fantasy IV Square Dragon Quest Chunsoft Contra Konami There's even a \"custom game\" option right off the rip that makes Station to Station essentially endlessly replayable. Pick your level size, biome, cliff heights, industries, and difficulty and then off you go. You can even randomize the biome and industry selections, making every new game, well\u2026 an entirely new game, which I love. I'm personally a fan of the largest possible map size, because it ups the challenge quite a bit but also leads to some incredible opportunities for huge stacks. I feel like the custom maps can be even more fun than the prebuilt levels because there's an element of chaos if you randomize the industries and biomes."

        "Content": "If you could peer into the future and visualize the most immediate outcomes of your actions, would you be able to make the best decisions, or would the weight of your past choices still hold you back? Harmony: The Fall of Reverie artfully takes a microscope to this idea by giving you the power of foresight to make conscious choices about which direction the story flows between its otherwise linear conversations. It took a few hours to get past all the necessary exposition before Harmony really got its hooks in me, but the story it eventually unravels into is a must-play visual novel. It does an eloquent job of mixing its classic choose-your-own-adventure style of decision-making with modern stakes that effectively hold a mirror up to the events of our own world. Developer Don\u2019t Nod\u2019s deft first swing into proper visual novel territory is told from the perspective of Polly and her alter-ego, Harmony, who dons the title of \u201cOracle\u201d in a place called Reverie. Reverie is an alternate dimension that exists on top of the in-game equivalent of our real world, where the spirit-like Aspirations of humanity use their essence to silently shape the growth of human history. You\u2019ll switch between text-heavy story passages and visits to the time-bending Augural, where you\u2019re faced with the next decision that guides the path of the story. That\u2019s all you get to work off of, but this simplicity makes for a relaxed cadence, and aside from some rough early exposition, there\u2019s only one main issue: Polly comes with baggage. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie Gameplay Screenshots 9 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask When she enters the spirit world and dons her identity as Harmony, Polly is given the ability to see into the future using the power of the Augural. A literal map shows the outcome of certain choices and is powered by Egregore, a dreamy blue essence generated by the interdimensional manifestations of humanity\u2019s ambitions (which is used as a significant metaphor throughout Harmony\u2019s campaign). However, Polly is almost constantly dogged by a past that not only hems her future potential but which took a little while for me to unravel and finally begin to understand enough to fully empathize with. Don\u2019t let the name fool you: Harmony is all about its conflicts \u201c This story is split up into five major acts plus a prologue and an intermission, which take roughly five to ten hours to complete \u2013 though you can breeze through it if you\u2019re a fast reader. This pacing makes things pretty simplistic on paper, but not in a bad way; you\u2019ll effortlessly bounce between story segments and return trips to the Augural menu, where you can plan your next move on the board. A few opening cutscenes do a great job of quickly setting the stakes, though the density of its exposition in terms of character backstories and pre-existing interpersonal politics made my eyes roll during my first playthrough. But once I\u2019d gotten a handle on all the jargon-heavy drama \u2013 which is made easier thanks to a built-in codex and the ability to read summaries of earlier conversations \u2013 I was eventually able to sit back and appreciate the deeply human story that I found myself embedded in. Harmony is a visual treat, too. Aside from a few masterful cutscenes connecting major story branches \u2013 which left me yearning for an animated TV series set in Reverie \u2013 most of this story is depicted through text and basic visuals. Illustrious voice-acting and thorough character writing still do a lot of heavy lifting between bigger moments, giving ample space for my imagination to fill in the details. Life is Elysium Polly\u2019s hometown of Atina \u2013 like Polly herself \u2013 is defined by its contrasts. As we walk into the bustling Southern European city for the first time, clearly inspired by Athens, the miasma of apathy around us is palpable as bystanders hardly look up from their devices. And yet, the warmth of the community center which serves as Polly\u2019s mother\u2019s home is equally tangible, despite the fact that Polly\u2019s feelings toward her mom are rightfully mixed. Don\u2019t let the name fool you: Harmony is all about its conflicts, which are appropriately subtle at first, but ultimately bubble up to the surface in clever ways \u2013 such as in the wake of a pivotal character\u2019s death, when another character\u2019s personal ambitions become clearest as the supporting cast grapples with one of the better depictions of collective grief I\u2019ve witnessed in a video game. Much like in real life, nothing\u2019s ever as simple as it seems in Atina or in Reverie, where parallel stories ripple back and forth, and yet there\u2019s always a piece of the bigger picture that gets missed when you commit to one path. But commit you must, and being able to see into the future only adds tension when the path you think you\u2019re taking leads you to an outcome you neither expected nor intended. In a later act, a choice I\u2019d thought would bring the community of Atina together only seemingly worked at first before unforeseen consequences set in, and there was no way to divert away from those consequences because of a decision I chose not to make earlier on. It may seem like shoehorning in retrospect, but I liked that this is actually more true-to-life than I was expecting from a video game where the central mechanic is being able to see the potential outcomes of my actions. In this sense, Harmony provides a smart commentary on the non-linear nature of our actual lives and the shortsightedness of only valuing a single perspective. Simply knowing other endings exist adds a bit of replayability. \u201c Granted, it took a few hours before I truly started to feel the impact of my choices on the mother-daughter relationship I fundamentally could not change, one which everything in this journey would continue boomeranging back to \u2013 regardless of the consequences of my own actions unfolding in the world around me. Ursula is played off the cuff, as though she is detached from the emotional impact she has on those around her. This makes sense given her \u2013 literally romantic \u2013 relationship with Chaos. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but be frustrated on Polly\u2019s behalf as Ursula yanked control of the story away from her, and this happened more than once. Face This World The Augural menu itself is easy to navigate, and it clearly communicates the effects your decisions will have in the short term. It also lets you zoom further out to the Heart display, which shows you how much progress you\u2019ve made in collecting crystals corresponding with each of the six Aspirations. These personifications also represent the six major endings \u2013 though it does seem like there was a secret ending that I disqualified myself from getting to watch, and simply knowing it exists adds a bit of extra replayability. The end goal is to slowly earn enough crystals through your decisions to \u201cpurchase\u201d the ending you want, but this isn\u2019t actually as binary in practice as it might sound. In reality, many of the story sequences making up the critical path either qualified or disqualified me from other paths in unexpected intervals, often forcing me to exchange crystals of one type for crystals of another to make concessions with the Aspirations themselves, or dip into adjacent paths as politics between the Aspirations grew tense in relation to the events taking place in Atina. Which of Harmony's six Aspirations would you side with? Bliss Bond Chaos Glory Power Truth Answer See Results There\u2019s an unpredictability here that isn\u2019t always comfortable, especially because I had my heart set on a certain outcome from early on when I grew attached to Bond, the Aspiration who seemingly offered the most peaceful route \u2013 at least, in theory. More than once, I had to sit down and weigh two lose-lose options in the short term, often knowing how the direct outcome of each option would help or hinder my goals in a vacuum, but rarely being able to visualize those outcomes in lockstep with other decisions I\u2019d already made or had yet to make. That could be frustrating, but it also kept Harmony exciting. Even as the Oracle of Reverie, Polly is still capable of causing serious destruction through poor foresight, and this is treated with appropriate weight throughout. Each of the five acts has its own theme, which changes both the tone of the soundtrack and the writing. You\u2019ll want to keep your volume turned up for the elated synthetic notes that mask the dark underbelly of Atina in the first few acts, before the music later becomes appropriately solemn with a bluesier, piano-driven score as the cast faces the inevitable uncertainty of their own existence. Luckily, things wrap up satisfyingly well \u2013 at least in the ending I got \u2013 and this soundtrack did a great job of keeping me grounded in Polly\u2019s shoes throughout."

In reality, however, the simple but engaging real-time combat of Persona 5 Strikers is structured much closer to action-JRPGs like Kingdom Hearts , barely resembling a musou game at all \u2013 and what seemed like it could be a throwaway summer vacation romp actually delivers the story of a full-blown Persona 5 sequel nearly worthy of the \u20182' Atlus avoided putting at the end of its title.

It\u2019s a fun twist on the previous structure, and the overarching story is a genuinely great one. It retreads some of the same ground as the first game in a way that generally feels cleverly referential rather than derivative, justifying itself as a different adventure while tying into the previous one (and even pushing back on some of its assumptions) enough to feel like a proper sequel \u2013 at least story-wise.

It was a thrill to slip so seamlessly back into this world, and Strikers maintains everything from Persona 5\u2019s wild, stylistic flair through all its menus and UI to the almost visual novel presentation of its dialogue (with the same excellent English voice cast returning) to the downright incredible soundtrack, this time full of excellent high energy remixes alongside entirely new tracks. It was easy to forget I wasn\u2019t just playing more Persona 5 when I wasn\u2019t in real-time combat.  Given all that\u2019s changed, it\u2019s truly remarkable how much Strikers still feels like Persona 5. \u201c  That said, no matter how much developer Atlus tries to frame Strikers as an accessible game for newcomers to the series, I really can\u2019t imagine playing it without having beaten (or at least having played a significant amount) of Persona 5 beforehand. The characters are all sharp and entertaining on their own here \u2013 including a couple of excellent new additions to the cast, who even managed to handily outshine Royal\u2019s new characters by the end \u2013 but their backstories and the events they went through in the original game are referenced far more often than they are explained. That stretches from mentions of small character moments that occurred in Persona 5 all the way to its climactic finale. You could probably still enjoy the overarching story of Strikers without that context, but don\u2019t expect to understand things like why there's a talking cat insists he\u2019s not a cat and can also turn into a bus.  There\u2019s also the fact that you start with a full JRPG party of eight playable characters pretty much from square one. I greatly prefer having the whole gang together right away, rather than there being some arbitrary reason why you have to gather them all over again, but there certainly seems to be the assumption that you will already know the general strengths, weaknesses, and specialties of each one. So while I enjoyed that Strikers treats its story as a genuine sequel and didn\u2019t waste time telling me what I already knew, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that anyone who hasn\u2019t played Persona 5 will probably not have nearly the same emotional connection to its characters and events. Granted, that\u2019s true of most sequels, but given Strikers isn\u2019t being outwardly framed as such a direct follow up (and Persona 5 still isn\u2019t available on PC or Switch like Strikers is), it feels particularly notable here.  Too Fast For Eyes  Thankfully, Strikers\u2019 combat is a lot of fun regardless of your familiarity with Persona 5. Fights are broken into discreet encounters triggered by stealthily engaging a lone enemy, but once you do so they\u2019ll explode into a whole horde of baddies. While that's decidedly different from a musou\u2019s usual open warzones, these battles do share that genre\u2019s signature deluge of weak opponents that act as little more than fodder to satisfyingly hack through. However, swimming through those oceans of pushovers like sharks are tougher enemies that need a more nuanced touch to take down, usually relying on exploiting one of their elemental weaknesses to stagger them for follow up attacks and additional damage. Persona 5 Strikers Screenshots 9 Images  The combat mechanics aren\u2019t especially deep, but they\u2019re not mindlessly shallow either. You build a party of four characters between fights and can then swap between them on the fly while the other three are controlled by AI, with each Phantom Thief offering their own flavor of Strikers\u2019 simple combo system. Mashing the attack button will string together a short combo, but ending that combo early with the Special button will result in a unique finisher depending on how many hits precede it \u2013 for example, three hits first will generally unleash an elemental AOE spell attack (saving the mana of casting it manually), while just one can range from Yusuke\u2019s rapid, agility-buffing slashes to Haru chopping enemies with her axe like they were firewood. There\u2019s also a dodge button, All Out Attacks to use when you stagger enemies, follow up attacks that seamlessly swap you to another character, and the ability to pause time and cast familiar Persona spells, but the action really is as straightforward as that two-button combo system most of the time (a foundation that will be recognizable for anyone familiar with many of Omega Force\u2019s other games).  That means fights can feel fairly similar as the campaign goes on, primarily distinguished by the element a baddy might use or be weak against (which can occasionally be pretty punishing if you unluckily build your party wrong and enter a boss fight without any characters that are able to exploit its weakness). But where the combat stays entertaining is in the differentiation and personality of each character. The hard-hitting, lightning-based knucklehead Ryuji remains one of my favorites, with a special that can make him resistant to flinching and combo finishers that can be charged up for more damage. Compare that to Morgana, who makes adorable cartoon noises as he moves and can even transform into a bus mid-fight, and each character feels mechanically distinct despite being functionally similar.  Each character feels mechanically distinct despite being functionally similar. \u201c  As you travel around Japan, most of the metaverse dungeons you\u2019ll be fighting through take over a large section of whatever city you are in, rather than just being a single (albeit heavily warped) building. They\u2019ll even turn a few of the real-world areas where you\u2019ll peacefully shop for items in between excursions into remixed combat arenas. It\u2019s a really weird and cool way to spin the Persona 5 formula \u2013 cities aren\u2019t quite as visually unique as each Palace in the last game, but that variety is replaced with an oddly delightful bit of digital tourism that comes from visiting and learning about real locations across Japan.  Crucially for fans of the original, the pace of these infiltrations is drastically different as well. While infiltrating a Palace in Persona 5 felt like a combination of a race and an endurance test, where management of your magic and health was critical to making it through without wasting calendar days, Strikers is significantly more relaxed. You can nearly always come and go from each dungeon as you please, which fully heals your team and respawns enemies, and there\u2019s no calendar clock ticking away as a time pressure. I didn\u2019t mind that change, because you do still have to be prepped with support items and a plan as you proceed (particularly against longer boss fights, where the villains almost always had about twice as much health as it seemed like they needed to), but it\u2019s a very different type of JRPG where challenge is concentrated more in bursts.  Similarly, other systems like the persona-summoning Velvet Room and Confidant bonds have been slimmed down significantly. On the positive side, the recognizable Velvet Room summoning interface has been streamlined in a way that made managing my loadout way less of a hassle (partly because there are fewer available personas total). On the other hand, the loss of Confidants and the side stories that accompany them is probably the biggest way Strikers diverges from what a proper \u201cPersona 5-2\u201d would likely be. Instead you gain Bond with your whole team just by fighting or progressing the story, which can then be spent on persistent skills like increased damage or battle rewards. It\u2019s a fine system, with skills worth perusing and some cute ways to get additional Bond like buying local recipes to cook with the team.  But while Strikers\u2019 main plot is great, the loss of the smaller stories that came from choosing which characters to hang out with during downtime can definitely be felt. The members of your team certainly get entertaining moments and opportunities to shine throughout, but there\u2019s also less character growth outside of the new party members (who, again, are seriously great). That said, this is obviously a very differently paced game as a whole; while Persona 5 takes more than 100 hours to complete, the month-long adventure in Strikers took me around 42 hours (which included doing most of the fairly uninteresting optional Requests that earn you better items for revisiting older areas). I didn\u2019t mind this comparatively shorter length since it never feels like the central plot is being unduly rushed along, but it\u2019s undoubtedly a more restrictive experience affair than its predecessor."

        "Content": "As my tiny boat sailed into the equally tiny port of the city-state of Portia, I couldn't help but look beyond the small town and toward a decrepit tower looming over its peaceful villagers; I wanted to go there, and it didn\u2019t take too long before I did. My Time at Portia is perhaps one of the most pleasant post-apocalyptic games out there, every part of it full of potential and an interesting sense of optimism. You'll find it in the goals and accomplishments of its people, and in My Time at Portia\u2019s design as a whole. It teases unreachable treasures off in the distance and lists items with parts I haven\u2019t yet encountered, letting me know there is something new still waiting for me. After playing over 65 hours, I\u2019m still finding more to explore and build in My Time at Portia. This town sim with an emphasis on building and resource management (and some RPG elements thrown in) is a fun adventure that, despite its flaws, I had a hard time putting down. Humanity is rebuilding in My Time at Portia. Civilization as they knew it was destroyed, and now many, many years after humans emerged from living underground, city-states have formed and your player arrives in Portia to follow in your father's footsteps and become a builder. Learning about this world\u2019s odd history has been intriguing, though the story and characters are generally far less charming than what you\u2019d find in something like Stardew Valley. The goal of the story itself is simple: expand Portia and become the top builder in town. I would have liked to have seen a more interesting driving factor for expansion other than money and prestige, but obtaining both is still a fun endeavor thanks to the impressive number of things to do in Portia and My Time at Portia\u2019s appropriately scaling growth.  Building the Basics My Time at Portia\u2019s calendar has four months with several weeks each in a year, and the first few seasons serve as a solid tutorial \u2013but even with so much to do in Portia, I didn\u2019t felt like it was dragging me around to see every attraction. Instead, it let me explore everything at my own pace, though it heavily encourages players to start by accepting timed building assignments. Building is your first priority in My Time at Portia, and the first commissions were designed well enough to help me establish a foundation in my routines for gathering resources. After either mining for ore, collecting wood, fighting monsters, or gathering other basic materials, I\u2019d add them together in a recipe to build an item. At first, gathering starts as simple as picking up stray wood and rock piles, but eventually escalates into cutting down massive trees with a chainsaw. I would sometimes dedicate whole days to just gathering resources for my next big project, but as I progressed, I gained things like the chainsaw to collect resources faster. I appreciated that as things got more complicated, new tools and services would arrive not long after to help me grow as a builder.  Those aids were important as I received complex schematics to build even bigger and more important items. They required me to process basic resources into different things before they could be used. Sometimes you have to process goods several times before they\u2019re finally made into the right component. I enjoyed pulling out a notepad to track just how many carbon steel bars I\u2019d need to build an item. Then, once done, I\u2019d submit those items for rewards, town favor, and money. I enjoyed this cycle not only because I found it to be rather relaxing, but also because the biggest assignments you\u2019re given directly change the town. I enjoyed pulling out a notepad to track just how many carbon steel bars I\u2019d need to build an item. \u201c When I wasn\u2019t focused on building, I was participating in one of Portia\u2019s unique holiday events and other activities that have some sort of minigame element, like for fishing, cooking, or taming a wild llama that I captured. The minigames are plentiful, and it was always a nice surprise to come across a new one. The complexity of the minigames vary quite a bit too, so it was helpful that most of them have simple tutorials. However, much like other farm-sim games, the onus is on the player to discover the finer points of My Time at Portia. It took me several in-game weeks to realize that I could kick trees more than a few times for special goods and that a notification would pop up to tell me when the tree was out of items to drop. This could be irritating to some players, but for someone like me who likes to live and learn in these worlds, I enjoyed the surprise of discovering something new.  I Just Want to Be Friends The one learning curve I did have issues with was figuring out how to please my fellow Portians. My Time at Portia\u2019s relationship system relies on the player chatting with residents daily, giving them presents, and playing games or sparring for relationship points. Presents give by far the most relationship points early on, but with My Time at Portia\u2019s impressive number of items, it\u2019s difficult to figure out exactly what\u2019s worth giving away. Very few item descriptions give clues to what might be liked by others, and even items I thought a person would enjoy based on their personality usually didn\u2019t work out. Building relationships in the early stages takes way too long without that important information. On the plus side, gaining friendship with one person awards you free friendship points with the people closest to your new friend.  At first glance, a majority of the characters seem more like caricatures rather than real people, and their starting few dialogue lines don\u2019t always make sense. Look, I get it Russo, you\u2019re a dedicated butler, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re always getting food for someone at all hours of the day as he claims to be doing when I talk to him. The clumsy dialogue early on thankfully takes far better shape after gaining people\u2019s friendship and during events. New dialogue lines did make me feel like they were trusting me with better information about themselves. New friendship levels also mean more activities, which further diversify what you do in My Time at Portia. The clumsy dialogue early on thankfully takes far better shape after gaining people\u2019s friendship and during events. \u201c Once friends, you can accept or extend invitations to \u201cplay.\u201d It\u2019s a weird title for the mechanic, but it\u2019s basically a bundle of minigames you can do to increase your relationship. You can launch fireworks, chat under a tree, play minigames and eat in the local pub, and plenty more. The activities change if you\u2019re on a date and if you\u2019ve built up Portia to a certain level. I particularly enjoyed seeing how my efforts to develop Portia returned to me in fun minigames and events. For instance, one mission asks you to clear a supposedly haunted cave so that the mayor can turn it into a tourist attraction. After completing that mission line, you can go in that cave alone or with a date to hunt \u201cghosts\u201d for points. Eventually, you can go on to marry select people in Portia. What I like about this marriage system is that your partner will actually help around your workshop. And, if you marry the right person, you can receive discounts at their shop or helpful stat bonuses \u2013 though you can get lesser levels of these benefits by just becoming friends. Overall, the relationship system is worth investing in, but I do wish it were tuned better so that the start of a relationship felt less like a chore.  Adventure Time The RPG layer of My Time at Portia is light and easy to manage on top of everything else. Leveling up gets you more stamina, which powers most things you do, plus improved health, attack, defense stats and a point to put into one of the three skill trees \u2013 there\u2019s one for battling, another for gathering, and the third for social. The skills were essential to increasing the efficiency of activities since they mostly offered passive bonuses. For example, as I needed more resources, I invested points in the gathering skill tree for a chance to get double item drops. It ended up being incredibly helpful \u2013 and lucrative. It seems no matter what I do, Portia continues to encourage me to keep going for more because it still has more to offer. \u201c One of my favorite things to do in My Time at Portia was mining. It\u2019s a relaxing and repetitive hunt for goods within the earth that pairs well with podcasts and audiobooks. There are several mines in Portia and each of them house different kinds of ores and relics. The relics are old-world items that are split into various parts and can be reconstructed. Yes, there\u2019s yet another layer of things to do in Portia. Those relics can be donated, sold for a fair bit of money, or placed in your house for bonus stat points that increase your characters stamina, attack, and other attributes. I\u2019ve been obsessively trying to reconstruct all the items I\u2019ve found, and some of them have proven to be extra difficult. The tracker I use to find relics has already been upgraded once and has been incredibly useful in my hunt. It seems no matter what I do, Portia continues to encourage me to keep going for more because it still has more to offer. Completing big story requests open new areas on a surprisingly large map, and in those new areas are at least a new type of resource, a new mine, or even a new dungeon. Some of the most fun missions were the ones where I accompanied the local peacekeepers in taking on larger groups of enemies to solve a bad situation. Otherwise, the dungeons were yet another good way to change up my days. Combat is simple hacking and slashing, but the variety of enemies keep things interesting enough. The dungeons are divided into several levels, each with their own rooms and a boss in the last room. Though I liked how dungeons were often a mix of a few basic puzzles and a handful of enemies, I do wish that the boss waiting at the end of each level were different. Some dungeons share bosses, and the ones I encountered only really required me to have some extra health items and a higher level than them to defeat."

        "Title": "Tetris Effect Review",
        "Score": 8.5,
        "id": "327dd5aacaf124f46a67b0e55cc01fad",
        "Content": "You may have played many versions of Tetris, but you\u2019ve probably never played one like Tetris Effect. The latest iteration of the falling-block puzzler comes from Tetsuya Mizuguchi\u2019s Enhance Experience and combines music, sound, vibration, and visuals into something that becomes almost transcendent. It does have a late-game difficulty spike that\u2019s worse for those that aren\u2019t playing in VR, but this is still a masterfully presented new entry in a long-running series. The main campaign of Tetris Effect is Journey, an engrossing series of connected boards each with their own diverse art style, music, and ruleset. Each board is unique and I was constantly surprised by what they offered. One might see you starting underwater as a beautiful particle-effect whale swims around you, while the next will be a desert landscape with a meandering caravan of camels that, halfway through, transitions to a realistic-looking version of the moon complete with an astronaut tooling around in a lunar vehicle. Some don\u2019t have music at all, instead opting for a soundscape drawn from the sounds of wind. Another had me inadvertently creating a jazz jam with the sound effects created by rotating, moving, and dropping pieces. Don\u2019t be fooled by the focus on music and mood though - Tetris Effect can be punishingly difficult. There\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule to how each stage will play: some are traditional in that they start off slow and ramp up after you clear a set number of lines, while others start blisteringly fast then slow all the way down to let you regain your composure, only to suddenly speed up again without warning. This constant fluctuation in speed and difficulty at times feels at odds with the often meditative presentation of Tetris Effect\u2019s stages. The ability to rotate a piece several times after it lands and the return of the hold queue, with which you can substitute a Tetromino once per turn, give you several ways to react but it can still feel cheap to suddenly see a board speed up 5 or 6 levels, slamming blocks into positions and ruining my carefully laid plans. If you find yourself in a pickle, you can activate Tetris Effect\u2019s trippy new time suspending Zone mechanic. Zone accrues as you play and activating it pauses the action, allowing you to clear lines for a high-score combo or to set up your board without the constant threat of falling blocks. Zone may not be as revolutionary as something like the ability to swap out a Tetromino for one in your hold queue but I enjoyed it for the strategic possibilities of stacking a board as high as I could and then quickly working to clear it as the timer ran down. Early on I\u2019d horde my Zone until I found myself in a jam, but a quick look at the leaderboards convinced me to use it as often as possible. Zone allows you to catch your breath when things get hectic. Tetris Effect rewards you more points for consecutive line clears, hard-dropping blocks into positions as quickly as possible, and other advanced maneuvers like spinning a piece into a tight space known as a T-Spin or completely clearing a board. Your total score across all stages in Journey is shown on a leaderboard and each stage awards you a grade depending on your performance. Pausing the action with Zone and stacking line after line (my record is 16 consecutive lines, AKA a decahexatris) is imperative if you want any chance at leaderboard glory. Toward the end of Journey Mode, Zone becomes indispensable \u2013 not for score, but as a means of dealing with the fluctuating speed of gameplay and increased clear requirement. Pausing the action with Zone and stacking line after line is imperative if you want any chance at leaderboard glory. \u201c It\u2019s a shame, then, that Zone isn\u2019t available outside of Journey Mode, because Tetris Effect offers a wide selection of other Effect Modes where I constantly wanted to activate it but couldn\u2019t. There\u2019s my all-time favourite, the traditional Marathon mode (in which you\u2019ll need to clear 150 lines as the speed increases at regular intervals) along with more puzzle-specific challenges that might require you to completely clear a board using only four blocks or react to modifiers like an inverted board or giant, oversized Tetrominos. These modes are great fun, especially the puzzle modes, and lend themselves to shorter jump-in-and-play sessions compared to the absorbing nature of Journey Mode. I also found myself playing a lot of the relaxation versions of the harder modes that let you play traditional Tetris without the threat of a game over. Focus Block No matter which mode you\u2019re playing, particle and sound effects erupt around you as you rotate Tetrominos and clear lines. If you\u2019ve played the awe-inspiring Rez Infinite and its Area-X stage, Tetris Effect\u2019s visual and audio design will be immediately familiar. I frequently found myself rotating blocks and holding off on dropping them into place not to increase my score, but to enhance the music and sights happening around me. Unfortunately, this is where Tetris Effect\u2019s style can sometimes get in the way of its gameplay. When you clear a line, a massive array of particles erupts from the board and other elements in the scene. It\u2019s honestly breathtaking to see a pod of dolphins explode in a shower of neon as their playful chirps surround you. But these effects are sometimes so distracting they caused me to fumble a difficult block placement or lose track of my place. One stage, for example, sees cowboys on horseback regularly walk in front of the game board, slightly obscuring your view \u2013 and that\u2019s frustrating when blocks are coming down at high speeds. This becomes particularly bad toward the end of Journey Mode, where the speed of falling blocks is so fast that a missed placement will doom the average player. Tetris Effect tries to offset this with a forgiving continue system and the ability to tweak the amount of particles and distance of the camera from the Tetris board, but after two hours of attempting the same 13-speed board continuously I longed for a way to turn off all the fancy effects just so I could concentrate. If you persevere and make it to the end of Journey Mode you\u2019ll be rewarded with the ability to sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds without gameplay, allowing you to really appreciate the level of craftsmanship in Tetris Effect\u2019s design. Relaxing on my couch and letting it all wash over me is one of the most amazing experiences I\u2019ve ever had in VR. PSVR is very much the best way to play Tetris Effect. \u201c PSVR is very much the best way to play Tetris Effect. Not only are all those effects even more spectacular in 3D, but the distraction of exploding particles is almost non-existent. I played through Journey Mode and several of the Effect modes both in VR and non-VR and found the cumbersome headset to be superior. When playing out of VR I regularly had to zoom the camera all the way in to minimise distractions, which made me miss a lot of the stages\u2019 particular visual flourishes. Maybe it\u2019s the relatively low resolution in PSVR or the ability for my eyes to more easily track movement in 3D, but even a multicoloured whale belly flopping in front of my game board never threw me off."

        "Content": "Abzu creates one of the most relaxing, stress-free underwater experiences I\u2019ve ever played. By emphasizing freedom of movement over survival, it gave me all the time I needed to soak in its gorgeous art direction, marvel at its fluid controls, and listen to its epic orchestral score. During the course of this fascinating three-hour adventure full of deep-sea mysteries and discoveries, its moving melodies ebbed and flowed with my emotions and fueled my curiosity to reach the finale, even when the story lacked context. What you actually do along the way is a little light on gameplay, but it\u2019s still a spectacular journey worth taking.   Each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction and attention to detail. \u201c Abzu\u2019s intriguing underwater world is presented with little introduction \u2013 you\u2019re a mysterious diver who awakens and begins to explore \u2013 but it generates enough mystery to propel you through a series of stunning locations. From seaweed swaying in the current to mysterious sunken shrines, each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction, attention to detail, and an impressive sense of scale as you swim through enormous chasms under the sea.  This journey feels remarkable because of the way it constantly dangles the next intriguing area in front of you. I found myself traveling through its underwater rabbit hole into a strange, unfamiliar world full of cryptic iconography and ambient life such as fish, turtles, and whales. I was constantly wondering what I would find around the next bend, and each new area I discovered kept the surprises coming with fantastic architecture and some incredibly large spaces to swim in. And while nothing (including some intimidatingly large sharks) wants to actually eat you, it\u2019s still a fish-eat-fish world down here, and you can observe the convincingly recreated circle of life by meditating at a shark statue if you want.   Continuing on my journey I slowly waded into ancient ruins or completely lit-up, cathedral-like structures, and enjoyed the leisurely pace. In certain places it speeds up, and high-speed channels function like highways that pick up the pace and push you into beautiful new territory. One of the more memorable speedways had me swimming alongside a pod of incredibly large whales. It made me feel like a small fish in a very large pool.  Even during the most spectacular moments the framerate was almost always consistent at 30 per second despite the density of life on screen. I noticed it slow down slightly a handful of times, like when ultra dense schools of fish would swim in a tight loop.  The rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. \u201c Abzu\u2019s journey into the deep is conveyed primarily through pretty graphics, but its rousing, evocative musical score really steals the show. Each new area you explore is bookended by music from Journey composer Austin Wintory, and his contributions sound absolutely wonderful. The stirring ensemble of strings and flutes bounces back and forth between soothing tunes and rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. The orchestrations are carefully used to punctuate emotional moments in a way that I\u2019ve seen few games do, with the tempo rising and melting away into the background appropriately. And whenever the music dissipated, the ambient sounds of the sea served as a constant reminder that I was mostly alone in this world. It all makes Abzu the closest thing to a playable version of Disney\u2019s Fantasia that I\u2019ve seen produced by a video game.   But what are we actually doing here, other than taking in the sights and sounds? Abzu never makes that clear, either from a story perspective or with gameplay depth. I did enjoy my time swimming from the start because simple controls make is easy for almost anyone to pick up and enjoy moving around. Abzu uses a familiar control setup that resembles a driving game: holding the R2 button dives deeper and constantly moves you forward. You can boost to push through through areas quickly. Within minutes I could effortlessly maneuver in the water, do loop-the-loops, or break through to the surface and pull off a quick mid-air trick like a dolphin. And what limited interactions there are with the environment focus on helping you get around: you can grab onto fish when you want to move faster or slower.  Abzu's simple puzzle are designed to keep you moving ahead. \u201c It\u2019s just a little disappointing that Abzu\u2019s smooth movement isn\u2019t really put to the test by any form of challenge, like a race through the environment. You avoid a few hazards, but that\u2019s about it. Nasty underwater landmines are the only attacker you encounter, and outside of a worrisome warning bell when you get close their scary zaps are nothing more than a momentary hinderance. Abzu has some puzzles, too, but they\u2019re little more than quick flip switches that don\u2019t require a ton of thought. They\u2019re only meant to open up the next breathtaking location and keep pushing you forward.  The mystery Abzu presents at the start is intriguing, but the end of story is a little too abstract \u2013 even relative to other wordless storytelling adventures like Journey. There are a few cutscenes, but it mostly leans on environmental storytelling to fill in the gaps of what happened to an ancient, alien-looking civilization we find here. But what happened and why were very unclear, and on my first time through there wasn\u2019t enough context to give the ending the power it seemed to aim for. I couldn\u2019t quite place what Abzu wanted me to feel, so it just left me puzzled because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what had happened. But considering the entire thing is just three hours long, it\u2019s short enough that I didn\u2019t mind diving back in for another swim through to piece together the story, which revealed significantly more meaning now that I knew what to look for."

That's the pitch on Lightyear Frontier, a cozy crafting exploration game with a unique mech-based twist to its farming. I mean, mechs for civilian use are hardly a new concept, but I can't actually remember a game giving it a proper shot like this. Lightyear Frontier does its best at its Early Access launch, delivering a fun romp around an alien world that's a bit short on story but goes long on customization and decoration. Unsurprisingly, the mech itself provides a lot of the fun here. It takes what would otherwise be a pretty predictable crafting and exploration game and gives it a new point of view \u2014 quite literally! You can get used to the scale, but jumping out of your mech immediately reminds you that the trees you tower over are still properly sized, or that the alien chicken creatures you enjoy feeding are as tall as a person. The mech driving is well done, too \u2014 this is a big, stompy piece of equipment, and if you've ever driven an older diesel tractor you'll recognize the clattering sound of that engine in Lightyear Frontier's Farmech. However, I am always sad to see a static, non-functional control panel in a digital cockpit. Lightyear Frontier Early Access Gameplay Screenshots 15 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Lightyear Frontier's biggest conceit is that it's a purely peaceful game. There's absolutely no combat here, and no real time pressure either \u2014 it's designed from the ground up as a chill experience. There are in-game days that tick by, but you're not required to sleep in a bed at night or anything, and there are no time limits to run up against. It delivers well on that angle as I found its relaxed pace to be pretty soothing. In fact, if you try to rush or optimize your way through it you'll probably stress yourself out for no reason. Lightyear Frontier is at its best when I realized it just wanted me to explore, find stuff, and enjoy myself. It's a game as much about taking in its nicely handcrafted, open alien world, building cool stuff and decorating it as you go, as it is about farming and crafting. The beginning is a little slow though, even with the intended pace in mind. Your starting, no-upgrades mech feels a bit sluggish when it's not sprinting, and you can't sprint if you're over your inventory limit\u2026 and the starting inventory limit is pretty low, which kinda hurts the giant super-strong robot vibe for me. That, and the storage boxes are a pain to manage, since Lightyear Frontier lacks that now-quite-mandatory feature where crafting stations pull from nearby storage for you. Nonetheless, once I got a few upgrades and unlocked some larger storage I forgot all about those first slightly frustrating hours. It's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. \u201c Frankly, that\u2019s because it's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. The details in the mech's tools and equipment are delightful twists on the themes of giant robot stuff. I loved shattering rocks and trashing trees with the giant chainsaw-slash-stake-driver, which only gets stronger and more destructive as you get more upgrades. Trees are planted with a huge sapling cannon to plunge seeds into the earth, while crops are sown by a scattershot seed machine gun that later gets a lock-on function. There's also the two tread-based modes: One's a path-breaking modification that lets you satisfyingly roll out dirt or stone paths, which then actually make you travel faster, while the other is a plow that lets you place freeform planting spaces for your crops across the surface of the world. My favorites, though, were the two most dual-function tools. The first, a giant vacuum, lets you pull up weeds and mature crops with remarkable speed. The second, a water spraying cannon, is initially a fairly weak blast hose that later becomes a long-distance stream that can charge up spheres of water and hurl them as soil-moistening explosions. And when you run out of water? Just go vacuum up more. What's your favorite co-op crafting job? Upkeep: Farming, watering Progression: Crafting, building Supply: Gathering, mining Exploration: Scouting, fighting Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results Those two tools are also vital because they're used to clean up the world around you. Your satellite buddy PIP-3R (that's Piper) narrates as you explore, but the world you're on had some previous inhabitants that left behind a huge mess of ground pollution. That wells up in the form of gooey gunk piles and a breed of mutant weeds that not only kill off surrounding vegetation but spread on the wind \u2014 occasionally even threatening your own farm. It's a fun little twist on weeding to catch them out of the air before they choke out your crops. Cleaning up the world unlocks more regions to explore, like thicker forests, twisty mountain paths, and coastal plains. You\u2019ll get new resources from each one that are then used to build additional equipment and buildings, as well as unlock more mech upgrades \u2014 like a stronger hose to wash down bigger goo piles and clean up even more new regions. It'll also attract attention from neighbors who are full for character, like a traveling trader who visits for a few hours each day to buy your stuff. There's another character \u2014 a plant science enthusiast who needs regular deliveries of produce and supplies \u2014 but I wasn't able to interact with him due to a bug that developer Frame Break tells us is getting fixed in an upcoming patch. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier. \u201c As for those ancient inhabitants that left all the ruins and mess? Well, I'm not saying it was aliens, but\u2026 You can explore the old ruins around the map, all of which send you on a kind of prop hunt in old buildings or caves that unlock new alien-themed stuff to build. Cleaning up the world also gets you bits of lore about what the ruins might have been for and commentary from Piper. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier, and quite disappointing in relation to the rest of the experience \u2014 not because it's outright bad or anything, but because it's very short and very sparse right now. It took me about 15 hours to clean up the world and get to the rather abrupt, pretty unfulfilling end, which is quite literally a popup screen saying the campaign is over as of its Early Access launch. I can clearly see where this will be expanded and improved over time, but right now that ending comes when things are just getting going. A short or open-ended story isn't a sin in a game like Lightyear Frontier, it just has to be paced in such a way as to deliver a real arc or end that feels like it's feeding into the post-story activity of building a larger farm and unlocking all the decoratable stuff. After all, I \"finished\" in 15 hours but spent another five excitedly exploring the new areas I had just unlocked, getting more mech upgrades and making the new buildings and decorations I now had access to. Speaking of decorations, there are a lot of them, and I was happy to do all kinds of customizing. You can get different parts for your mech, and even mix-and-match them or paint them to create custom looks. You can also build all kinds of neat little doodads to place around, decorating the world with outposts and campsites. It's hard to feel too disappointed by a game where you can make a garden of odd rock sculptures and then decorate it with even odder alien rock-plants."

        "Content": "Horizon Call of the Mountain knows what its job is: to ride the popularity of Horizon Forbidden West and spearhead Sony\u2019s new foray into virtual reality gaming, the PlayStation VR 2. It really goes for it by placing less of a focus on the expansive story of Forbidden West and much more on spectacle, often wowing with the sights it places in front of you. On that level it\u2019s a remarkable technical showcase that lets you have a good deal of excitement when taking the handbrake off and handing you control of its exhilarating combat. It\u2019s therefore a slight shame that it often operates at a much more relaxed pace, which does allow you to frequently take in the beauty of its world, but prevents itself from thrilling consistently from start to finish. When it does all click, though, and those heights are hit, a very fun time is there to be had. Similarly to how a Disneyland ride borrows from whichever film it's based on, Call of the Mountain takes the Horizon experience and condenses it into something much more bitesize while trying to keep the same flavour. This is exemplified best by the Pirates of the Caribbean-like opening, in which your peaceful river cruise is rudely interrupted by the likes of a soaring Stormbird and towering Tallneck dino-bot. It\u2019s a real credit to the work that developer Firesprite has done in translating Guerrilla's original art design into something more impressive than any TV screen could do justice to \u2013 both in the stunning vistas this world offers and the trademark machines that populate it. Horizon: Call of the Mountain -- State of Play 2022 Official Screens 7 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The first time you see the scale of some of these creatures really is a sight to behold, not only from the shift to true first-person perspective emphasizing their true size, but with their presence felt further thanks to the haptic feedback felt both in each controller and the headset itself: as you quite literally feel the ground shake with every step as these massive machines pass by. It\u2019s a real showcase for the PS VR2 right off the bat, with huge spectacle blending with small detail \u2013 right down to the delicate ripples your fingers make in the water and the rude splashes made by the feet of giant machines. Blockbuster opening aside, over the course of its roughly six-hour campaign Call of the Mountain takes the essence of Horizon\u2019s gameplay and boils it down into a much more manageable set of tools that works in VR. Rocky landscapes to explore, hostile machines to take down, puzzles to solve \u2013 it's all here. What\u2019s notable, however, is that this is very much a linear experience that stands in sharp contrast to Zero Dawn or Forbidden West\u2019s vast open worlds. An inquisitive mind is occasionally rewarded with fun side activities, such as stacking rock cairns or collectible archery targets to hit, but mostly you\u2019ll be guided down a funneled path. This narrow approach naturally works well in VR, even if some of the inherent exploration that Horizon normally offers is lost. If you suffer from any level of vertigo, this may not be the game for you. \u201c There are two movement options to choose from: a \u201cgesture\u201d-based system that moves you around when holding two buttons and imitating a walking motion with your arms, and a more traditional analog stick-based system. After trying both I opted for the former for most of my playthrough, despite both coming with their pros and cons. At first, the gesture system didn\u2019t strike me as overly intuitive, but once I got to grips with it I preferred it simply because it made me feel far less nauseous when playing for long stretches (by which I mean about 30 minutes). I did, however, find myself switching to the analog sticks whenever entering combat, as the dodge mechanics associated with this moveset (a flick of the right stick) made for a much easier time. Everyone\u2019s mileage on this will obviously vary based on your VR tolerances, so I\u2019d recommend trying out both to see which suits you best. Now\u2019s the time to say that if you suffer from any level of vertigo, this may not be the game for you. I\u2019m not too terrible with real heights, but here I did start to feel a little queasy when looking down at some of the ludicrous distances I could fall from. There are quite a few opportunities for potential plummets as well, thanks to the sheer amount of climbing you\u2019re asked to do. Climbing cliffs. Climbing vines. Climbing ice walls. Climbing rock faces by lodging dual pickaxes into them. Almost so much climbing that you may find yourself wanting to climb the walls of your house as well. Now, I wasn\u2019t naive enough to think that a game called \u201cCall of the Mountain\u201d wouldn\u2019t involve some climbing, but I was taken somewhat off guard when I found that it really is the majority of what you\u2019ll be doing here, especially in the early hours. Climbing isn\u2019t overly challenging, but honestly reaching for handhold after handhold gets quite dull after you\u2019ve scaled your third or fourth outcrop. It does get slightly more interesting once tools such as the grappling Grabcaster are introduced, and the immersion of it all as the wind swirls around your ears and the excellent music swells as you reach the next peak is undeniable. Although some ascents offer slightly more excitement than others, I can honestly say I never found climbing to be consistently fun. It\u2019s frustrating then, that it dominates much of what you\u2019ll be doing in Call of the Mountain, in particular when compared to its much less frequent but infinitely more exciting combat sections. What We Said About the PlayStation VR 2 The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you\u2019ll need to use it. Even so, it\u2019s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2\u2019s unique features. \u2013 Gabriel Moss, Feburary 16, 2023 Score: 9 Read the full PlayStation VR2 review  Largely taking place in mini arenas, these gladiatorial battles against all manner of unfriendly machine are often the highlight of each mission. It\u2019s where the immersion of it all really beds in as you briefly forget what era of Earth you\u2019re living in and the rhythm of combat takes hold. Armed with the signature Horizon weapon of a bow and arrow, you\u2019ll quickly find yourself aiming for enemy weak points using the PS VR2\u2019s impressive eyeball tracking tech, and then quick-dodging out of the way of flying melee attacks before ducking and weaving your head out of the way of projectiles. It\u2019s a set of combat options that gradually builds over time as well, as new ammo types are introduced and your arsenal expanded. As stronger foes present themselves, naturally more firepower is needed, and with it the levels of excitement to find increase \u2013 a thrilling fight against a colossal Thunderjaw being a particular highlight. Preparing yourself for encounters becomes increasingly more important as you build all sorts of elemental arrows in a pleasing crafting system that lets you manually attach arrowheads, explosives, and flights, thus further creating a tangible connection to the world. More gratifying than crafting arrows though is, of course, firing them \u2013 and in this regard Call of the Mountain has really nailed it. Now, my real-world archery experience may only stretch as far as giving it a go when 11 years old on a school trip, but in my expert opinion this feels pretty damn good. There\u2019s a real pleasing \u201cping\u201d to the way each arrow flies off of the bowstring and haptic feedback tickles your palm, and then an even greater thrill as it slams into whatever is unfortunate enough to be in its way and sets them aflame thanks to explosive Blaze. Unlike the climbing, it just never gets old to watch sparks fly and machine parts fall off as the fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space. It\u2019s a highly satisfying cadence that works really well in VR thanks to its enthralling but never overwhelming speed, but is also forgiving if you happen to get blindsided by a roaming Scrapper, for example. If you do manage to take some damage you can find a pocket of peace amongst the mayhem by going for a snack break and refilling your health bar by munching on some fruit. A health bar is smartly located on one of your hands (much like we saw in Half-Life: Alyx) meaning it\u2019s never more than a quick glance away, like checking the time on a watch, and always in view when aiming down sights. All in all, the interface of Call of the Mountain is very cleverly implemented, making it feel like a tangible part of your character and not a series of distracting floating boxes that threaten to take you out of the beautiful world. The fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space. \u201c Puzzles also pop up here and there and, again, serve as a welcome break from climbing. Did I mention there\u2019s a lot of climbing? The problems are sometimes fun but never overly difficult, and once the novelty of actually physically picking up gears and slotting them into position myself wore out they became yet another minor obstacle on the way to the next combat encounter or story moment. That story is serviceable, but one that is definitely engineered in order to facilitate big moments and fun cameos rather than tell a layered tale itself the way the previous two Horizons have. Here you play as Ryas rather than Aloy \u2013 he\u2019s a Shadow Carja rebel who must complete a series of tasks in order to atone for his crimes. His internal monologues are mercifully limited in a smart maneuver that allows you to experience this world first-hand yourself and not be distracted by voices in your head. Naturally, things escalate as the plot thickens, and the second half of the campaign becomes much more engaging than the first thanks to the action increasing in both quality and quantity. A personal highlight is the aforementioned Thunderjaw cat and mouse section, which conjures up memories of Jurassic Park at its rousing best. There are a few little nods scattered throughout for big Horizon fans to find of value here \u2013 familiar faces like Aloy drop in to say hello \u2013 but don\u2019t necessarily come in expecting a dense new chapter in this universe\u2019s lore. Outside the main story you\u2019re free to explore your small home base, take a closer look at artifacts collected on your expeditions, and chat with friends made along the way. It\u2019s also home to the pleasant safari mode: a largely tranquil alternative version of the opening boat cruise which shows off a selection of the Horizon bestiary in its natural habitat. It\u2019s short, sweet, and a reflection of the Disneyland-like nature of Call of the Mountain as a whole \u2013 an impressive technical showcase for PS VR2 which uses the inherent wonders of the Horizon world to sprinkle thrills into its sometimes-lazy river ride.

This year\u2019s entry into Sony San Diego\u2019s annualized baseball series plays as well as ever and looks great, but the confines imposed by its rigid release schedule are also more apparent than ever. A new cooperative mode is a welcome addition and an already solid stadium builder has been expanded upon nicely, but technical issues are more persistent than previous editions too. MLB The Show 22 is still a really good baseball game \u2013 it\u2019s just beginning to show signs that it may be time to call in a reliever. The lifelike recreation of Major League broadcasts in MLB The Show 22 is just as impressive as last year. There\u2019s a cinematic quality to the way player-controlled action is framed, with intros, outros, overlay graphics, and the deep pool of stats that baseball fans expect. The lovingly detailed recreations of real world ballparks look great in 4K too. The lighting is particularly stunning; real baseball games play out over multiple hours, and the in-game transition from sunset to a stadium fully illuminated against the night sky is marvelous. Suncast shadows in the afternoon give way to 360-degree illumination when the sun falls, and it\u2019s easy to forget what you see on screen is still just 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s on a hard drive. MLB The Show 22 Gameplay Screenshots 14 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There is an all new broadcast crew bringing their voices to the series this year: Jon \"Boog\" Sciambi & Chris Singleton have replaced the Matt Vasgersian-lead team as the in-game announcers. The performances are generally convincing, and new voices are refreshing after many years of the same crew. However, the number of unique lines of dialogue is noticeably lower than before, and lines repeat with greater frequency than before. There are only so many times I could hear the same bad joke about how the ball is \u201cjust not carrying to first\u201d before I wanted to mute the announcers entirely. It also leads to some baffling holes in the dialogue, like when Ken Griffey Jr., who appears with spoken lines in the Road to the Show campaign, is only referred to as \u201cNumber 24\u201d when you play with him in games. The strength of MLB The Show is traditionally in its versatility, and that\u2019s no different here. Controls can be simple, with automatic baserunning, one button pitches, and easy hitting \u2013 or they can be complex, with multi-part thumbstick movements for pitching, and precision hitting. The former is easier to execute, but the latter will yield better results if done well, incentivising and rewarding you for trying to grow your skills without gating out those who want to have a more relaxed involvement. The strength of The Show is once again in its versatility. \u201c Likewise, Franchise Mode can be played in painstaking detail, with minor league call-ups, drafting, scouting, and micromanaging of budgets, or that can all be set to auto while you focus on playing in the games themselves. You\u2019re given multiple ways to right whatever historical wrongs have kept your favorite team from winning a championship and becoming a perennial powerhouse. It\u2019s a feat of design to be able to cater to users from the casual to the hardcore, yet MLB The Show continues to set the standard for accommodating diverse tastes. That said, while Major League Baseball is nearly 150 years old, The Show is still trailing behind this ancient sports institution in a few key areas. New rules extending the Designated Hitter throughout the entire league are going into effect as of the 2022 season, yet they aren\u2019t reflected here. This is especially disappointing as it relates to two-way players, including The Show 22\u2019s cover athlete Shohei Ohtani, who is a revelation as both an elite pitcher and hitter. In real-world baseball this rule change allows him to function as both a designated hitter and starting pitcher, enabling him to be relieved as a pitcher while remaining in the game as a batter. Sadly, MLB The Show lacks the capacity to make the same allowance. It\u2019s the sort of issue one would hope can be resolved in an update, but as of release is a swing and a miss. Double Play Online co-op is one of the key new editions in 2022, allowing you to form teams for 2v2 or 3v3 competition across platforms either with friends or through random matchmaking. Players on each team alternate batters while at the plate and rotate between pitching and fielding each inning, and being able to focus single-mindedly on one defensive task is liberating. While one person plays cat and mouse with pitch selection, the other can focus on where to go for force outs and make strategic choices around the diamond. There\u2019s joyous excitement to stepping up the plate with a friend on base, knowing they are depending on you to make the hit that brings them in for a key run. However, there are some limitations to co-op too. You can play in random games or in a limited Diamond Dynasty playlist, but there are no persistent teams or co-op leagues. You can\u2019t choose your opponents either, so the only way to play against friends is luck in matchmaking. Rotating defensive roles is also mandatory, forcing you to switch back and forth even if one player only wants to pitch while the other only wants to field. I played one game with a random teammate who was a really solid hitter and defender, but their struggles on the mound doomed us as our opponents drove in multiple runs every other inning. In its current iteration, co-op feels more like a fun proof-of-concept rather than a fully fleshed-out mode fit for online competition. The stability I\u2019ve come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit. \u201c Co-op games frequently failed to connect me with cross-platform friends when we tried to play together as well, and all sorts of technical issues were unfortunately common in my time with The Show 22. Players would sometimes walk to the dugout frozen in strange poses, tutorials that I had disabled in settings would still appear, I had to restart multiple times after freezes, and online matches of any sort were prone to random disconnects. The stability I\u2019ve generally come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit, which is definitely a shame. Bases Loaded The Diamond Dynasty mode will be familiar to series veterans, allowing you to assemble teams made up of players from throughout baseball history, collected via randomized card packs, and face other player-assembled squads. The concept is well established in sports games, but the execution in The Show has been, and remains, excellent. Programs return as the battle pass stand-in: you accumulate XP by playing any of The Show\u2019s different modes, unlocking rewards as you progress up levels. Stubbs are your primary currency for purchasing packs, which you can once again buy with real money, but you also earn them at a reasonable rate regardless. I focused on completing daily challenges called \u201cMoments\u201d and was able to earn XP and Stubbs at a pace that didn't coerce me into spending cash. In no time I was able to relive the glory days of the 90\u2019s Seattle Mariners, with Ken Griffey Jr. patrolling the outfield while the golden mullet adorned Randy Johnson attacked batters with relentless fastballs. Microstransaction Reaction There are microtransactions in MLB The Show 22, just like in previous years. Paying money for Stubbs in order to unlock packs is a viable way to accelerate team building in Diamond Dynasty, but competitive teams can be built quickly through normal play as well. The cost of stubbs is fairly reasonable too: $5 will buy you 5000 stubbs, which is enough for three Show Packs that have five cards each. But even if you shell out for them, skill reigns supreme in online matches, so cash investments tend to be \u201cpay for an occasional, slight percentage advantage\u201d rather than true pay-to-win. The random nature of what can be found in card packs is also handled fairly well. You won\u2019t know what exactly you will get from a pack, but the odds of finding different kinds of cards are openly displayed, and there is enough variety of themed packs that you have a good idea what types of players you may unlock. It\u2019s still a roll of the dice, but to a more reasonable degree. A new mini-season mode is a very welcome single player focused activity for your Diamond Dynasty team, allowing you to pit them against seven CPU controlled teams in a 28-game season, complete with a miniature playoff at the end. Between this and the returning turn-based-strategy esque Conquest mode, it feels like we have reached a point where it\u2019s possible to have a rewarding Diamond Dynasty experience for players who prefer not to face the wild-west of random human opponents. On the other hand, the Road to the Show story mode is indistinguishable from previous versions, but it continues to be one of the best modes in any sports game anyway. Playing as a created prospect, following your player on their journey to the big leagues while you raise RPG-esque baseball stats, is addictive. Games often take just a few minutes, and it\u2019s hard to resist the urge to play just one more game, especially when you are seeing the ball well and making solid contact as a hitter. The few plays per game I spent on defense, framing pitches and gunning down base stealers as a catcher were great palette cleansers between at-bats, and the stat building mini games on off-days are rewarding. It still takes too long to transition from double-A to triple-A and on, but Road to the Show is so much more about the journey than the destination. Surprise! You were just called up to The Show. What position do you want to play? Pitcher Catcher Infield Outfield Designated Hitter Answer See Results The stadium builder has returned exclusively for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, unfortunately leaving The Show\u2019s Switch debut a slightly incomplete. The user interface has been tweaked, and building your dream ballpark is a smoother experience now that props can quickly be called up from a radial menu. Your custom-created stadium can now be played at day or night, and placing lights is surprisingly strategic. Prebuilt templates can expedite the process, and a great mix of serious and humorous pieces give you freedom to create both classic ballparks and absolute monstrosities. I built a ballpark with alien spaceships and a carefully illuminated (for safety) T-rex herd just because I could. It\u2019s a great example of a feature debuting one year, and improving in moderate but meaningful ways the next."

It\u2019s a fun little dance to do, asking you to scavenge resources to burn from beneath the waves as you travel, make sure the engine doesn\u2019t overheat, and perform other little tasks in order to keep you sailing smoothly \u2013 not to mention you\u2019ll occasionally have to hop out entirely in order to address larger obstacles blocking your way, like massive closed gates or abandoned buildings. Once you get a specific upgrade, your ship even has the ability to dive below the water itself and basically become a submarine, cleverly allowing you to go under some roadblocks rather than through them. But while that\u2019s a flashy addition, the most impactful change from the original is that raising your sail isn\u2019t quite as simple this time around. Rather than just pressing a button, you first have to raise a mast, then climb it, grab a rope to attach back down below, and finally adjust the position of the sails to match the frequently shifting wind for optimal speed. Additionally, there are obstacles in the background that your sails can run into and get damaged, as well as low overhangs that will knock down your mast. These additions do make the process of sailing without your engine more engaging, but unfortunately it\u2019s mostly in the same way that you have to be \u201cengaged\u201d while trying to swat a fly. While Changing Tides\u2019 scenery is beautiful, the 2D perspective makes it annoyingly difficult to determine whether or not your sail is actually going to hit something. Additionally, unless you are already on the roof of your ship, you often have very little time to react between seeing an oncoming overhang and actually being able to do something about it, even when zoomed out. What that means is that some of my absolute favorite moments in Lone Sails \u2013 catching a breeze and simply enjoying its sights and music after a stressful stretch of powering the engine \u2013 are essentially gone, with those sections now occupied by the worries of sail management, threat assessment, and running inside to check your radar to make sure you\u2019re not missing items hidden beneath the waves. These added tasks are still entertaining but make for a very different overall vibe, and it\u2019s one I grew tired of more quickly. Thankfully the areas you are sailing through are still a feast for the eyes and ears. The subtle score perfectly fits the terrain around it (even if it\u2019s not as memorable as Lone Sails\u2019 incredible soundtrack), and your path to the right is frequently full of moments you could screenshot, print out, and post on an art gallery wall without them looking out of place. The underwater sections can be particularly gorgeous, with one highlight being a cluster of fluorescent jellyfish that I swam through along the underside of my ship. There are some cool scripted moments throughout the nearly five hours it took me to complete Changing Tides, too \u2013 none of which I would want to spoil. They are grandiose in both scope and scale, and they do a good job of adding jabs of adrenaline to an otherwise slow-paced game. In fact, they\u2019re also the only real source of tension you\u2019ll find, as it felt like there was very little risk of anything going terribly wrong unless it was explicitly designed to do so this time around \u2013 a far cry from memories of my vehicle in Lone Sails constantly catching on fire. That can make it feel like you\u2019re just going through the motions rather than fighting to stay moving at all. Did you play Far: Lone Sails? Yes! Yes, but I didn't finish it No I had never even heard of it Answer See Results"

        "Content": "The Yakuza series and its spin-offs are renowned for juxtaposing simmering crime drama plots alongside quirkier complementary diversions, but Lost Judgment is the first time that the side dishes have turned out to be more satisfying than the main course. An intriguing murder case at its center doesn\u2019t quite go the distance thanks to a lack of late-game twists and turns and puddle-deep detective gameplay, but a surprisingly absorbing series of optional investigations that place returning star Takayuki Yagami undercover at a Yokohama high school go a long way towards redeeming the overall adventure. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask When a body is found decomposing in an abandoned warehouse, the prime suspect has an airtight alibi: getting caught committing an entirely different crime at the exact same time the warehouse murder is believed to have taken place. It\u2019s a provocative jumping off point to be reunited with private investigator Yagami and his likeable crime-solving cohorts, and it kept me enthralled in its opening hours as a series of contradictions were picked apart and modern concepts like deepfake technology were posited that made me feel like I was leading man in an episode of CSI: Shinjuku. This initial intrigue doesn\u2019t last, though, since all of the major parts and players in Lost Judgment\u2019s main case have been identified and unmasked roughly by the start of the third act, which means any sense of mystery evaporates from there on out as the characters talk in circles and at length while re-examining the same pieces of evidence without revealing any new details. I kept waiting for a rug-pulling plot twist that never arrived, and despite the customary escalating boss fights in Lost Judgment\u2019s closing chapters, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was just going through the motions. Defective Agency I felt equally apathetic towards Yagami\u2019s detective work which, despite some minor tweaks and additions, remains as disappointingly shallow and inflexible in Lost Judgment as it was in the original. Quick-time event-heavy chase sequences are repetitive and often ridiculous, running laps of the same small circuit and always seeming a few comedic toots of Yakety Sax away from being an actual Benny Hill skit. Meanwhile, the covert tailing missions are slightly less frustrating this time around thanks to the ability to press a button to \u201cact casual\u201d and hide in plain sight, but no less plodding. Then there are the parkour sections, which are clunky enough to make an Assassin\u2019s Creed fan want to fall on their hidden blade, and the stealth scenes that force you to throw coins in very specific spots to distract guards before you can take them out (just quietly creeping up behind them greets you with a greyed-out button prompt and no course of action other than to scurry back to your overtly signposted hiding spot). The added detection gadgets, like a highly sensitive microphone and a detector for hidden cameras, are certainly welcome but in practice they\u2019re effectively not that different from the simple crime scene pixel-hunting from Yagami\u2019s first outing. The one aspect of Lost Judgment\u2019s sleuthing that does feel a bit more involved is Yagami\u2019s ability to eavesdrop on conversations between pedestrians in order to pick up certain words or phrases that can be used as search terms in the Buzz Researcher app on his phone. In doing so, he can sift through a feed of text messages and triangulate specific points on the map where new clues might be uncovered. It\u2019s still relatively restrictive since you can only use the exact search terms you\u2019re given, but as far as actual deduction goes it at least made me feel I was getting my hands dirty rather than merely having them held. Private School Private Eye And yet, despite all of these gripes, I can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t end up enjoying my time with Lost Judgment overall, and that\u2019s almost entirely thanks to the surprisingly meaty undercover side cases that Yagami can undertake at the Seiryo High School. Playing the role of a Japanese Johnny Depp in a 21 Jump Street-style high school sting feels refreshingly novel, and I enjoyed posing as a choreographer for the school dance squad or helping the robotics club refine their machines, while simultaneously sniffing around for clues to the identity of an unnamed professor suspected of recruiting students into criminal activity. Playing the role of a Japanese Johnny Depp in a 21 Jump Street-style high school sting feels refreshingly novel. \u201c These school stories often spill out into interesting places outside of the school grounds, and also do a great job of contextualising a lot of the mini-games found in Lost Judgment. The amount of time I spend in the virtual Club Segas found in Yakuza games has diminished with each subsequent sequel over the years; however, in Lost Judgment I was forced to brush up on my Virtua Fighter 5 skills in my efforts to endear myself to the school\u2019s eSports team while I investigated one of its members accused of cheating in tournaments. I appreciated the way Lost Judgment cleverly takes previously peripheral ingredients and makes them feel vital. Lost Judgment - Gameplay Screenshots 31 Images In all, there are 10 different school societies to be infiltrated and investigated, combining to add more than a dozen hours of compelling casework to the package. It\u2019s shocking to me that these are all entirely optional, since I found them to be far more engaging and mechanically diverse than anything offered by the main story. This is despite the fact that, since they\u2019re treated as \u2018side missions\u2019, they\u2019re sadly not given the same level of slick presentation gloss as the fully-voiced cutscenes that flesh out much of Lost Judgment\u2019s main mystery. My only major issue with the schoolyard subplots is that in a game that details the potentially horrifying ramifications of bullying, including youth suicide, you spend a surprising amount of time as a grown man beating the absolute snot out of teenagers. It only takes a few pranks played on the maths teacher for Yagami to morph into the meanest form of Mr. Miyagi and send a gang of troublemakers from the classroom to the emergency ward, which seems more than a little contrary to Lost Judgment\u2019s virtuous main message. Not Exactly Like a Dragon Thankfully, the majority of Yagami\u2019s street fights are contested against consenting adult combatants. Unlike the turn-based battles of 2020\u2019s Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgment stays true to the real-time Streets of Rage-style beat-\u2018em-up action that the Yakuza series was built upon. That suits me, since my personal preference is for pulling off a swift combo-based beatdown rather than get bogged down in menus puzzling over which defense spell to cast next. In addition to the Tiger and Crane fighting styles that return from the original Judgment, Yagami now has a Snake style, which is heavy with slippery parry moves, and I gravitated towards using it more often than not thanks to the satisfying counter-attack opportunities it consistently creates. Which fighting system do you prefer? Turn-based RPG brawling from Yakuza: Like a Dragon Real-time combo-based beat-'em'up action from Lost Judgment (and classic Yakuza games) Neither, if I see a gang of street punks I cross the street and duck into the nearest Poppo Answer See Results However, Lost Judgment just can\u2019t compete with Yakuza: Like a Dragon when it comes to sheer enemy variety. Whereas Like a Dragon packed in enough colourful characters to overcrowd the world\u2019s angriest-looking Where\u2019s Wally? poster, Lost Judgment just pits you up against more or less the same stock-standard street punks in the vast majority of its brawls. The scraps certainly increase in challenge as you go on, with gang members swelling in numbers and bringing in more deadly weapons like katanas and flamethrowers, but it ultimately feels a bit stale when the thousandth head you crack has the same scowling facial texture as the first. Speaking of textures, the Kamarucho and Yokohama settings from Like a Dragon remain every bit as detailed in Lost Judgment, and as dazzling as ever to walk around \u2013 particularly at night. Yagami has access to a detective dog named Ranpo who can be used to sniff out hidden secrets, but I also enjoyed the simple pleasure of just peacefully walking him through the neon-lit streets. However, it\u2019s a shame that Lost Judgment\u2019s environment isn\u2019t quite as functional as that of the last Yakuza, and indeed while vending machines are on every other street corner, you can\u2019t actually buy items from them like you could in Like a Dragon. Instead you need to hustle to the nearest Poppo anytime you want supplies, ironically making these convenience stores seem somewhat inconvenient by comparison. Kung Fu Kickflip That extra legwork is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of a skateboard, which ex-lawyer Yagami can magically whip out at any moment to go from lapsed legal eagle to wannabe Tony Hawk. However, it\u2019s unfortunately pretty clumsily implemented. The button you hold down to run is the same one that activates the skateboard, and so I frequently found myself accidentally skating into a cluster of pedestrians and stacking it when I was merely trying to sprint past them. That made getting around substantially more stop-and-start than I\u2019d have liked. Besides, cash is so easily earned that I was more inclined to just order a taxi from Yagami\u2019s phone than I was to try to reach anywhere on foot. Ex-lawyer Yagami can magically whip out [his skateboard] at any moment to go from lapsed legal eagle to wannabe Tony Hawk. \u201c In fact, while Lost Judgment has an incredibly long list of features and some of them are really well done, skateboarding is just one of many that looks good on paper but is not so good in practice. It\u2019s true that you can race in violent Road Rash-inspired motorcycle races, try and grind your way to high scores in a warehouse skate park, and go undercover at a Russian school for ninjas. But it\u2019s also true that the motorcycle races are hampered by stiff controls and an impractically low chase camera, the skateboarding tricks are on rails (and not in the good way), and infiltrating the ninja school basically amounts to playing a game of darts and getting dragged along into yet another monotonous chase sequence. In some ways, Lost Judgment is a bit like a gacha machine \u2013 all those toys sure seem enticing and varied when you look at them through the glass, but once you dispense a capsule and crack it open you realise they\u2019re surprisingly cheaply made and you\u2019re suddenly not sure whether you actually needed it in the first place. By that same 100 yen token, there are a lot of really fun activities that only emerge over time. I was over 30 hours into my playthrough and well beyond rolling credits on the main story before I unlocked a robust arcade boxing mini-game, complete with 24 different opponents and its own levelling system and unlockable special moves, for example. I've still only uncovered three out of the 12 game cartridges you can play on the Sega Master System in Yagami's office. And what\u2019s this? A hilarious mini-game where you have to drunkenly chat up barmaids in the local nightclub? There are certainly a lot of hidden delights to be found digging around in Lost Judgment's sandbox, as long as you\u2019re prepared to invest the time and take the good with the bad."

        "Content": "Climbing is one of those things that works really well in VR with motion controls, but rarely gets more than a moment to shine. The Climb 2, though, is all about it. This is developer Crytek\u2019s second iteration on the idea of scaling large, vertical obstacles, and it\u2019s a major improvement over the original Oculus Rift launch game in terms of controls and level design. And even though climbing sounds pretty basic on its own, the simulated sensation of dizzying heights makes the tension feel real \u2013 and The Climb 2 comes with a bump in graphics that shows off what the Oculus Quest 2 can really do when it\u2019s running on all cylinders. Things start off pretty simple. Once you get through its brief tutorial, you\u2019re allowed to swing (pun intended) between any of its five main zones, and within each of those are three different levels that unlock as you beat the last one. Thankfully, it does away with the original\u2019s arbitrary level-gating system that felt entirely out of place and limited your ability to explore early on. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask If it sounds like the amount of content here is light, that\u2019s because it is: that\u2019s a total of just 15 levels. Don\u2019t come in expecting a story, either. The Climb 2\u2019s storytelling is all found in its intricate level design, though a bigger plot is something that could certainly have made this experience even more cohesive and interesting. The only thing you\u2019ll be doing is jumping, gripping, and swinging your way up this meticulously detailed virtual climbing wall \u2013 and you\u2019ll do it alone. If it sounds like the amount of content here is light, that\u2019s because it is.What makes it work is that there\u2019s a refreshing amount of diversity. Each level, even within the same zone, has a completely different backdrop and art style, and map layouts are all notably different from what came before. For example, one of the early levels in the City area has you climbing along the outsides of skyscrapers in broad daylight, whereas the next level starkly contrasts that by having you jump between moving elevators with gorgeous city lights glimmering across the horizon at night. Later, you climb through mountainous crevasces while evading feral wolves, then you\u2019re leaping between hanging baggage containers, and even climbing up the side of a giant wind turbine. It all looks fantastic, and the constant change in backdrop keeps things feeling fresh and interesting throughout. Are you afraid of heights? Yes! Yes but not in VR No Answer See Results Speaking of graphics, The Climb 2 \u2013 which I played on Oculus Quest 2 but is also available on the original Quest \u2013 offers a significant leap in graphical quality over its predecessor on the same system. Off the bat, it offers sharper textures and far more clarity; I noticed fewer jagged edges on objects as well, at times fooling me into thinking I\u2019d been playing a PC VR game and not one on a standalone device. Most important here is the visual boost to nighttime environments. Some nighttime levels in The Climb were downright unplayable due to claustrophobic level design and unclear directions, but that\u2019s solved now in The Climb 2\u2019s similar areas. Even the most dimly-lit levels have clearly marked grip points now, and the navigation system can easily get you back on track if you start to lose direction. The moment-to-moment gameplay of The Climb 2 is meditative in its simplicity.As tense as it can be, the moment-to-moment gameplay of The Climb 2 is meditative in its simplicity. Just like in the original, its core game mode \u2013 called the Professional mode \u2013 is about balancing speed and stamina. Trying to hold a grip with one hand can cause you to lose too much stamina and slip, but you can press your Touch controller\u2019s trigger button halfway to hold on longer and restore stamina mid-climb, or you can apply chalk to your hands to make them retain more stamina and restore stamina much faster. These are all strategies that carry over from the original game, but they feel so much smoother now. For instance, maintaining a half-grip is now more forgiving and intuitive. Chalking your hands is also much quicker and far less clunky. As a result, it\u2019s much easier to get into a groove in The Climb 2. Making things even more interesting, most of the maps now have several different pathways that you can take to reach your goal. They\u2019re also left open to interpretation: if you see an opening to take a shortcut by, for example, jumping directly to a distant ledge instead of climbing towards it, you can probably do it. The other big upgrade is that a vastly improved physics system means that you\u2019ll get to move across objects and obstacles that have some physical reactivity as opposed to the strictly static world of the original. You\u2019ll jump between hanging tents, climb across ropes, and hang onto scaffolding for dear life as it bounces around in response to your weight. This introduces a ton of flavor to the gameplay. The Best VR Games of 2020 6 Images Despite being way more intuitive, The Climb 2 still hasn\u2019t fully escaped the troubles of the original. It\u2019s a physically intense game which often makes you crane your neck to play, and that can cause some discomfort. And while the level design is far less frustrating than that of its predecessor\u2019s, there will still often be moments where you get your head stuck inside of a wall, or your avatar\u2019s full body will block you from making an obvious jump, causing you to fall to your death. As with the original, you can customize your avatar\u2019s hands, but there really isn\u2019t much of an incentive to do so. You can\u2019t even show off the stuff you\u2019ve earned to other players, and vice versa. A vastly improved physics system means there's some real physical reactivity.The continuing lack of a real multiplayer mode is especially disappointing, given it was such a missed opportunity in The Climb. Instead of racing someone to the top of a mountain in real time, you can compete against ghost avatars made from your friends\u2019 leaderboard scores. This is plenty of fun when it challenges you to get better at climbing, but it\u2019s just not the same. Finally, if the intensity of managing your stamina or infrequently chalking up your hands is too much, there\u2019s a Casual mode that does away with these things. It\u2019s a great way to jump into a level and start climbing, and I found it a helpful way to scope out a level and get a sense of direction before climbing it for real in Professional mode. It\u2019s great that both modes have their own leaderboards, meaning that you can go head-to-head with a ghost opponent in Casual mode if that\u2019s closer to your speed."

        "Content": "It\u2019s easy to scoff at the Labo VR Kit\u2019s simple cardboard headset and collection of ridiculous add-ons as little more than Google\u2019s Cardboard with Nintendo branding, but this kit is a surprisingly solid and in-depth introduction to the world of VR. While the display resolution and framerate fall far below the average dedicated VR headset and many of the associated games are extremely simple novelties, there are enough weird and whimsical games and tools included to provide a unique and (mostly) enjoyable experience when used in short bursts. The Virtual Boy 2, this isn\u2019t. Like Nintendo\u2019s previous Labo kits, the initial focus of Labo VR is on cardboard construction and customization. And while interlocking large cardboard sections or putting the finishing touches on a project can be highly satisfying, the sluggishly paced instruction videos and countless steps involved can quickly turn the building aspect of Labo VR into a chore. The Labo accessories you\u2019re prompted to build are sturdy and well engineered, but you\u2019ll likely never come away from putting one together with the hope that your build time had last longer.  The full $80 Labo VR Kit comes with six main \u201cToy-Con\u201d projects: a Camera, a Bird, a Wind Pedal, an Elephant, a Blaster, and the VR Headset itself. (Alternatively, you can purchase a $40 Starter Set that includes only the Headset and the Blaster and purchase the rest as add-ons.) The included software gives each project an estimated completion time, which can range from a simple 30 minutes to a staggering three hours for the Blaster. If you\u2019re planning on building every project (and you really should), you\u2019re looking at six to 11 hours of creasing cardboard tabs, stretching rubber bands, and applying stickers. Fortunately, when you\u2019re done, you\u2019re done. Labo creations aren\u2019t made to come apart, which is wonderful for weary builders but unfortunate for those who lack the storage space for an oversized camera or a strange boxy bird. I did find myself suffering from fatigued arms and eyes after exploring Labo\u2019s VR environments for extended periods. \u201c But the Labo series\u2019 somewhat monotonous building slog is old news; the real star of the show in Labo VR is, well, the VR. Nintendo achieves this technological feat the same way Google did with its Android phone-powered do-it-yourself VR viewer: by including a special pair of plastic lenses that create the illusion of a virtual world around you when the Switch is inserted into the cardboard headset. Unlike most VR headsets, Nintendo has forgone a head strap of any kind, forcing you to hold the Labo VR goggles against your face during play. Though the integrated head tracking and motion controls work well enough with this setup, I did find myself suffering from fatigued arms and eyes after exploring Labo\u2019s VR environments for extended periods of time. The tiring combination of holding the head set while you gaze into it may be intentional, as it forces you to take occasional breaks \u2013 a recommendation Labo VR isn\u2019t shy about promoting. As one might speculate based on the Switch\u2019s modest undocked specs, Labo VR\u2019s headset display is quite the step down in terms of visual quality when compared to normal handheld gameplay. As it turns out, positioning your retina two inches from a 720p screen (which is split in half to give each eye a unique view) can cause blurry visuals and some uncomfortably noticeable pixels. This is known as the screen door effect, and Labo VR suffers from it at almost every turn.  And yet, even with issues of clarity and comfort, Labo VR still manages to provide a decent VR experience. The image may not be as crisp as the you\u2019d see on an Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or even a PlayStation VR, but Nintendo\u2019s colorful worlds and virtual interactions are immersive nonetheless. Virtual Absurdity The simple Labo VR Headset is a jumping-off point, a gateway to the five other Toy-Con projects included in the kit. Each project is built to work in tandem with the Headset, most times attaching to the front of the goggles. Like the original Labo Variety Kit, some projects can bring hours of entertainment while others fall flat after their first go-round. Constructing the main VR Headset unlocks a crowded corner of the Labo VR software known as VR Plaza, where 64 mini-games are showcased. Many of them pair with a specific Toy-Con project or bonus cardboard doodad. The initial dozen or so mini-games are simple concepts that allow you to get a feel for different environments and gameplay. Drive a car, throw a boomerang, fill a silverware drawer with mustard \u2013 it\u2019s all in good fun. Not every mini-game or mode in Labo VR is going to hold your attention for an extended period of time, but many may, and experimenting with all the different options is fun in its own right. Kablasta, the Blaster\u2019s second game, is the best fruit-shooting simulator since Donkey Kong 64. \u201c The most complicated build, the Toy-Con Blaster, provides a quick-firing arcade experience. The main game, known simply as Blaster, revolves around fighting off an invading alien horde. The heft of the blaster in your hand, coupled with the constant cocking and firing motions, really add to the illusion that you\u2019re annihilating wave after wave of slimy space creeps and hulking bosses. Unfortunately, Blaster looks the worst of any Labo VR game because it involves lots of quick movement from both you and the enemies around you. Levels can get blurry in a flash, and that effect often left me momentarily disoriented. Kablasta, the Blaster\u2019s second game, is the best fruit-shooting simulator since Donkey Kong 64. You and a friend take turns convincing a pool of hungry hungry hippos to swim to your side by launching different types of fruit into their gaping mouths. There\u2019s more strategy involved than you might think, and it\u2019s easy to get caught up in luring the mighty mammals to your side of the pool. Kablasta is a weird, yet immediately accessible concept that finds a way to make pass-and-play with VR worthwhile. Two of the stranger pieces in the Labo VR set include the Bird and foot-operated Wind Pedal Toy-Cons, contraptions that unsurprisingly work hand in hand (or perhaps hand and foot). On its own, the Wind Pedal gives you the option of playing as a leaping frog in Hop Dodge. The gust of blowing air put off by the pedal with each push is an odd, but exhilarating sensation, and it was hard to help from smiling as I jumped further skyward with each blast. The Wind Pedal isn\u2019t required for the games centered around the Bird Toy-Con, but it does add some fun realism and much-needed speed to both. The aptly named Bird Mode puts you behind the controls of a bizarre bird cyborg on a mission to find and feed all the baby chicks hidden across a peaceful island. Squeezing the sides of your cardboard bird device in the real world causes wings to flutter in both realities, taking you to greater heights. The fast-paced Bird Dash drops you on the same island and challenges you to fly through a string of hoops as fast as possible. The exploration is relaxing and scenic, while the hoop racing is more about increasing your speed and improving your high score. Both modes are pleasant and offer a good deal of content to work through. The most awe-inspiring and enjoyable Toy-Con project is easily the Elephant. \u201c The most awe-inspiring and enjoyable Toy-Con project is easily the Elephant. It\u2019s main mode, the one I spent the most time playing and showing others, is simply known as Doodle. The Joy-Con located at the end of your Elephant\u2019s trunk uses its IR sensor to measure depth, allowing you to draw and sculpt in a 3D space. Different colors, effects, and lighting can also be added to give your sloppy sketch just the right look. It\u2019s legitimately hard to put down, especially when you get a friend involved in the goofy multiplayer game Guess the Doodle. Outside of Doodle, the Elephant Toy-Con introduces Marble Drop, a simple and addicting puzzle game based around guiding a marble over and through various obstacles. Like Doodle, it\u2019s the realistic depth that really adds to this mode\u2019s fantastic sense of immersion. With 100 premade puzzles and the ability to craft your own with a well-stocked level editor, Marble Drop is another Labo VR experience that can easily steal away hours of your time. The least impressive project, from both a visual and interactivity standpoint, is by far the Camera. The two main Play modes, Ocean Camera and House Camera, are so basic that even the slight thrill of zooming in on virtual objects for the perfect snapshot is quickly dulled. Though each mode gives you certain sea life or poses to capture, it can be tedious to wait to see them appear. Only being able to take three pictures at a time doesn\u2019t help, and lands the Labo VR camera at the bottom of the pile in terms of lasting replay value. Lookin\u2019 Down On Creation As each Toy-Con project is successfully assembled, Labo VR unlocks both VR Plaza games that work with it and interactive notes about the Toy-Con\u2019s inner workings. What\u2019s really special about VR Plaza games is that they\u2019re all creations made within Labo VR\u2019s interactive game-building mode, called Toy-Con Garage VR. The original Toy-Con Garage was my favorite part of the Labo Variety Kit, allowing anyone to engineer their own cardboard toys and gizmos. Garage VR expands upon this idea by allowing you to engineer not only basic inputs and outputs, but your very own virtual reality games. 28 Images The depth of creativity found in Toy-Con Garage VR is astonishing, giving you the ability to cobble together games based around racing, rhythm, fighting, and more, but it still suffers from a few major setbacks. The most glaring is the fact that even while you\u2019re given the tools to edit both your game\u2019s underlying mechanics and 3D environment, it\u2019s short on tutorials to help you surmount the decidedly steep learning curve involved. That\u2019s to be expected \u2013 after all, you\u2019re programming a game. But even when simplified, that\u2019s no easy feat to get started. It should be noted that every game in the VR Plaza can also be edited and used as a basis for your own creation \u2013 all you have to do to look under the hood is pause and select which kind of editing you\u2019d like to tinker with, 2D for connecting basic interaction framework and 3D for setting the right scene. But this ability sometimes aggravates the issue of complexity by dropping you into an overwhelming maze of interconnected programming nodes and perfectly places models. Still, the tools and the potential are there. If you\u2019re clever or patient enough, Toy-Con Garage VR gives you plenty to work with and loads of opportunities to craft whatever kind of game you like. Completing a game creation leads to the second major issue with Labo VR\u2019s creative side \u2013 an inability to share the fruits of your labors with others. With no online capabilities, even the most impressive player-made VR games won\u2019t get much recognition or well-deserved play time if they can\u2019t be downloaded by others. There\u2019s always the chance that Nintendo could update Labo VR with some kind of games showcase in the future, but knowing the company\u2019s aversion to online innovation (and the fact that it never did this for the previous Labo kits) the chances seem slim. If you and those who are physically close enough to put their faces in your Labo VR are the only ones will ever experience your creations, it makes the idea of investing so much time in learning to use these complex tools seem like wasted effort."

        "Content": "Social media has changed the world since 2005. There was no Instagram back then. No Twitter, no Pinterest. Facebook was around, but still in its infacy \u2013 it still had the \u201cthe\u201d at the beginning of its URL \u2013 and even YouTube hadn\u2019t gone live yet. Yes, it was a much calmer, less distracting world back then. Back when Nintendo first brought us Brain Age . It was early \u201905 when this series\u2019 original brain-training game debuted in Japan, and over the next couple of years it and its sequel ushered in a minor mainstream movement both there and around the globe. Calculating your brain\u2019s functioning \u201cage\u201d and then completing training exercises meant to make your mind move more youthfully was the focus, as real-world neuroscientist Dr. Ryuta Kawashima played host to each activity in the form of a floating, smiling polygonal face. The games were well-received and helped Nintendo expand the DS audience to include adults who\u2019d never played traditional video games before, but who were intrigued at the idea of sharpening their mental abilities. With the series\u2019 success, you\u2019d have thought we\u2019d have seen a third installment sooner. But Brain Age has laid dormant since 2007, and the world transformed in the meanwhile. All of those different social networks, all of the apps and tablets, text messages and blinking screens grabbing at our eyes \u2013 all of those things that didn\u2019t exist back when Brain Age first arrived \u2013 they\u2019ve all served as the inspiration for this franchise\u2019s revival. Because Brain Age: Concentration Training isn\u2019t concerned with calculating how old your brain is anymore. Now, Dr. Kawashima simply wants to help you improve your focus. And he\u2019s sold his soul to the devil to do it. For whatever reason, for this new sequel, the good, smiling doctor has transformed into a demonic version of himself. With pointy horns atop his head, red-tinged skin and a set of sinister grins and cackles, the once-tame and inoffensive activity host is now one pitchfork away from channeling Satan himself. It's an odd and unnecessary visual. The justification for it is flimsy, as the new category of activities presented in this sequel is labeled \u201cDevilish Training,\u201d with the word \u201cdevilish\u201d being used to mean incredibly tough or challenging. But I\u2019m at a loss as to why Nintendo of America decided to leave that word and its associated objectionable imagery in place here \u2013 NOA has traditionally shot down anything even remotely religious over the past few decades, censoring several titles and even keeping entire games (like Shigeru Miyamoto\u2019s Devil World ) from seeing release in our region at all. I\u2019ve personally disagreed with that practice in the past, but now I\u2019m wondering why an exception has been made here. Some people won\u2019t see it as a big deal. We\u2019ve got plenty of sports teams around the country using Devils and Demons as mascots, after all. But I think this kind of imagery is going to be a big mismatch with Brain Age\u2019s target audience of older, non-gamer adults in America. I gave the first Brain Age to my Mom as a Christmas gift, years ago. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to hand her a copy of this and force her to go face-to-face with the Devil Doctor every day. That will be another drawback for many, too \u2013 the fact that Brain Age is built with short, daily play sessions in mind. It locks down the vast majority of its content from the start, only giving you access to a handful of activities the first time you power it on. Other training exercises and small games open up every day you play, as the game\u2019s encouraging you to come back once every 24 hours to keep your brain-training regimen moving along at a regular pace (the only way it will be effective). But it\u2019s disappointing that, if you\u2019re having fun and don\u2019t want to stop, you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. The doctor will say \u201cOh, sorry. You\u2019ve already played enough today.\u201d He actually says things like that, too. Audibly. Dr. Kawashima spoke only in text bubbles in the older Brain Age games, but here he\u2019s fully voice-acted. That\u2019s a nice, modern upgrade, and makes things like the game\u2019s instructional Brain Seminars actually interesting to watch and listen to. The lip-synching with his polygonal model is a little off, though. And also a little off is the game\u2019s handwriting recognition. 99% of the time it\u2019ll pick up the letters and numbers you\u2019ve drawn on the touch screen perfectly, but every once in a while it just registers your writing wrong \u2013 which invariably immediately leads to failure in whatever activity you\u2019re currently engaged in. If you\u2019re doing rapid-fire math calculations as the game thinks your 4 is a 9, well, sorry about your luck. You\u2019re credited with a mistake and your rhythm is disrupted, which will likely lead to a second mistake, and then a third, and then the doctor giving you some kind of platitude like \u201cOh, it looks like you lost focus there. Try harder next time.\u201d Screw you, Kawashima. It wasn\u2019t my fault! The fact that the game has the power to get your emotions worked up like that, though, is ultimately a good thing. You really will get invested in the process of improving your performances. Brain Age is a pride killer \u2013 you\u2019ll go into it thinking \u201cNo problem. I got this.\u201d And then you\u2019ll mess up something simple and get a result that says \u201cYou did well! For a 97-year-old.\u201d As for the actual array of activities, they\u2019re fairly diverse. The core category of \u201cDevilish Training\u201d is the focus, and it includes such challenges as remembering the answers to multiple math problems in a row to be able to write them down later, matching cards (the classic Memory game) and recalling the positions of blocks that blink and disappear. \u201cSupplemental Training\u201d includes activities drawn from the older games \u2013 the standard \u201cdo 20 math problems as fast as you can\u201d kind of things. The \u201cConcentration Challenge\u201d is a time attack against sets of blocks parading down the screen and then disappearing \u2013 you have to write down how many were in each group, in order, as long as you can and you get scored with the numbers of seconds (or minutes) it takes before you make a mistake. The last two categories, \u201cBrain Training\u201d and \u201cRelaxation Mode,\u201d include more traditionally video-gamey diversions, like the match-three puzzler Blob Blast that has you turn the 3DS on its side and line up falling bombs with like-colored blobs. (It\u2019s similar to the eShop\u2019s Bomb Monkey or Nintendo\u2019s old Wario\u2019s Woods .) Virus Buster, the touch-controlled take on Nintendo's classic Dr. Mario , returns as well. And casual time-waster Klondike Solitaire makes an appearance too, giving a bit of timeless appeal to the overall package. Solitaire\u2019s always a staple. Probably the best design out of the whole package, though, is Block Head. It was donated to this Brain Age project by Intelligent Systems, the same team responsible for the recent, excellent 3DS hits Fire Emblem: Awakening and Crashmo . It\u2019s a territory-grabbing challenge that has you competing against an A.I. Kawashima to grab more space on a game board than he can, with each level offering a different configuration of spaces and point values. It\u2019s an excellent little puzzler and one that I think deserves to be expanded into its own, standalone game for the eShop. (And it could happen. DSiWare has brought us small, carved-out  chunks of Brain  Age games before .)"

        "Content": "Farming Simulator 2013 is one of the purest and most focused business simulations I\u2019ve ever played. You own a farm in a country town, and your only goal is to grow crops to make as money without any \u201cfinal objective\u201d to chase. There are no scores, storylines, cosmetic money sinks (such as new player skins or houses), or other long-term goals. You simply choose a crop from four possible seeds to start your career, plant it in your field, harvest it, sell it and put that cash back into the farm. It\u2019s almost impossible to damage your crops unless you\u2019re not paying attention, so it\u2019s difficult to fail or find yourself in a no-win situation. Still, you should harvest as much as you can because of the sheer number of investments you can make into your business. There are dozens of licensed vehicles, forty plots of land (of which you only start with one), and additional buildings such as solar collectors and greenhouses that you can sink your money into. As you increase the number of fields you own, it can take more than a dozen tractors and tools to coordinate all the work and minimize downtime. It could take hundreds of hours of work to afford everything, but you have complete freedom in how you accomplish your goal and what your priorities are. Livestock, more or bigger fields, and faster machines are all available, so you\u2019ll have to think about what best suits your particular play style. More valuable crops take extra work and extra machines in order to maximize your profits, so you need to decide whether you\u2019re willing to make the investment or stick to simple but low-value crops. The entire system gives you a tremendous amount of freedom in how to best approach your business, although that first week will be fairly slow-paced. The most unusual aspect of Farming Simulator 2013 is the complete lack of competition. In a single-player career, there is only you, the farm, and the AI townspeople who wander around but can\u2019t be interacted with. Even in multiplayer, all players work together on a single farm. In both modes, the game will not fail you for slow production or even no production at all. As a result the gameplay is incredibly peaceful, though possibly a bit daunting for newcomers to the series. Admittedly, the act of virtual farming doesn\u2019t sound like it would require a complex series of steps to perform, given that most of your job involves jumping in a tractor, attaching a tool, and slowly driving in straight lines. However, there are subtleties that are under-mentioned or completely undocumented that require some practice to master. AI-controlled workers can be hired for most tasks, and watching how they perform can teach you techniques to use when you get behind the wheel. Hiring those workers is the key to running a successful and profitable farm, especially when you\u2019re trying to manage a half-dozen fields or more at once. The tutorials will help smooth out the learning curve, but the lessons are a mixed bag. All the tutorials focus solely on controls rather than techniques or theories. By the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll know exactly how to drive all your vehicles but not other essential tasks. For example, there are five selling points for your crops around the town, and each accepts different freight. The map doesn\u2019t tell you what each building is, so you\u2019ll have to drive around to learn the lay of the land. The map itself is huge, so you may get mixed up when you first start out. It\u2019s a step backwards; the previous game in the series featured a tutorial that had you take a tour of the town and learn what exactly the buildings did, so it\u2019s strange that it\u2019s not included in this version. Those aren\u2019t the only presentation missteps. To help keep you busy during those slow early days, you\u2019re given regular \u201cmissions\u201d to earn you some extra cash. There is no punishment for failing a mission, and they pay really well when you\u2019re starting out, but they\u2019re executed poorly. There are only two types of missions that ask you to mow some grass or move heavy equipment across the town. The problem is, you don\u2019t have the equipment to perform either mission when you start off with a new career, so you\u2019ll be forced to decline the mission unless you spend all your first-day profits on the machines. Further, the mission types seem a little strange\u2026 no missions for delivering certain crops to certain houses? No scrambling to save a field from a pest outbreak? How about a mission where you have to drive your water trailer to assist the fire department to help extinguish a burning building? While reward money is good, mowing grass is incredibly boring, and the mission system simply doesn\u2019t feel rewarding enough. Despite the documentation and information the developers failed to provide, the community is incredibly friendly and helpful. It takes a certain kind of mentality to play Farming Simulator at length, and that mentality doesn\u2019t lend itself to griefers or trolls. As a result, you can hop into any public game or browse the forums to find dozens of people ready to help you learn the basics and answer your questions. I\u2019ve joined several multiplayer games of Farming Simulator 2013 blindly and never encountered any player who was unwilling to share helpful tips. Up to nine other players can join a farm that the host has taken online, and all those hands can make a serious difference in how much work gets done. Players can be instantly kicked or banned by the host, and any vehicle or tool can be reset with two clicks of the mouse in the map view, so there is simply no room for players who won\u2019t behave. All money earned goes to the farm owner (the host of the game), so other players are there just to help out and socialize. Without competition in any form, and because any save file can be used in single- or multiplayer, all players naturally gravitate toward helping each other accomplish goals in their farms. It\u2019s a relaxing environment that encourages teamwork and communication above all else. Graphically, Farming Simulator 2013 is quite far behind the curve, but I suspect no one is getting it for state-of-the-art beauty. All the machines look good and are fantastically animated, but the environment is full of low resolution textures and low-polygon-count objects. It looks better than the previous game in the series, but that\u2019s not saying much. While the graphics are serviceable for the most part, there are blatant draw-in lines that make for some ugly moments. You can\u2019t adjust your draw-in distance in the option screen, so even if you have a top of the line computer, you won\u2019t be able to stand on a hill and watch amber waves of grain sway in the breeze. In fact, while you can usually tell what\u2019s going on with your farm just by the textures, certain states of the land (such as whether it\u2019s wet with fertilizer) are actually cut off with those short-distance draw-in lines. That means you won\u2019t be able to know exactly how much a particular field has grown unless you\u2019re practically on top of it. The map view helps offset this problem, but it\u2019s still a problem that can\u2019t be ignored. There is no music to speak of, and any sounds in the game are limited to the engines of your vehicles. This helps sell the atmosphere, but your ears may be a little bored. Your best bet is to put on some music while you play. As with previous entries in the franchise, Farming Simulator 2013 has mod support for future machines, maps, livestock, or buildings. Although mods were sorely lacking for the American release of the previous game, there were several large official DLC releases, so hopefully more content will be available in the coming months."

        "Title": "4 Elements II Review",
        "Score": 7.5,
        "id": "a541a25bed7cbe49ab244e80c2ccdfbf",
        "Content": "The successor to 2008's highly acclaimed 4 Elements, 4 Elements II is a sophisticated look at the Match 3 discipline. It's far prettier and more challenging than the original, and it's definitely deeper. It's also eminently affordable (currently less than ten bucks), making it easy to recommend for those who fondly remember whiling away hours with the first game four years ago.  But what about the rest of us?    What you need to know right off the start is that 4 Elements II delivers itself, outwardly anyway, as a kids' game. It's all magic and castles and innocence. And fairies that flit about the screen. The music is generally soft and soothing, and there's nothing to offend the sensibilities of impressionable minds. It's a gentle approach that even younger children will appreciate but more mature gamers might find a bit immature.  When you first fire up 4 Elements II, this whole Match 3 notion seems very far away indeed. Through illustrations and animated sprites, you're presented with a story about a magic kingdom \u2013 not surprisingly, the same magic kingdom found in its 2008 predecessor \u2013 that's fallen onto hard times. Seems said kingdom has been thrown into darkness and will remain that way until some brave soul \u2013 that would be you \u2013 dares to restore the revered \"magic book\" to its former glory.  You then proceed to make your way through the book, chapter by chapter. Each chapter follows a similar routine \u2013 a non-Match 3 puzzle to start, several Match 3 levels in the middle, and other assorted non-Match 3 puzzles scattered throughout and at the end. These peripheral puzzles will take one of several forms \u2013 spot the difference, hidden object, and the like \u2013 yet few will ever present a serious obstacle to the adult gamer. Indeed, while children and purely casual players may enjoy them, many more will likely find them unnecessary and perhaps even bothersome.  Regardless, the quality of the Match 3 play is second to none. In 4 Elements II, like the original, you don't merely jump about willy-nilly busting blocks. Instead, there's a very definite method to the madness.  You see, it's all about the liquid \u2013 a liquid that must eventually flow through to the end of the current grid, but can only do so if you manage to clear a path for it before the timer hits zero. You clear that path, as I alluded earlier, by \"drawing\" the cursor through three or more adjoining colored cells. Do that, and the tiles underneath those cells evaporate, leaving an open corridor through which the liquid flows. Run the cursor through five or more adjoining cells, and you'll also trigger an explosion that eradicates even more tiles from the immediate vicinity. The more cells you connect, the bigger the explosion, and the more open space you create.  But there's far more to it. Along the way, you'll encounter blockades in the form of boulders, frozen tiles, and solid metal plates. You'll come upon nifty little machines that fire flaming arrows toward other nifty little machines, which in turn explode and carve massive openings. You'll trigger land mines. You'll see mini-grids in which you must re-arrange puzzle pieces to form a pipeline or re-arrange massive cement blocks to clear an opening. And you'll find ways around \u2013 or through \u2013 those metal plates too.  Aiding you in your quest is an assortment of four power-ups. Active and usable only when you've successfully connected a given number of similarly colored cells and then unusable until you've again connected another batch of similarly colored cells, each power-up is quite unique. The first acts like a pick-axe, allowing you to break apart boulders. The second will melt frozen cells. The third will transpose one cell of a given color for a cell of a given color, and the fourth reshuffles the entire board.  The game is smartly designed to deliver constant variety. For starters, all grids are not created equal. While the very first is rectangular, future grids are in the shapes of animals, lanterns, bugs, and any other number of random shapes. More importantly, the game forces you to change up your modus operandi on the fly.  One moment, for example, you're moving slowly and carefully, scanning the board for any color connections, playing the odds of which color will drop next, and crawling inch by painful inch in what at times seems like an impossible situation. Then, quite suddenly, you'll make a breakthrough and the entire board comes alive \u2013 tiles exploding, new cells dropping, arrows shooting this way and that, and liquid flowing like a raging river. Later, you're in another section where stringing together eight, nine, ten cells at a time is easy but the block puzzle lying ahead is tricky enough to tax the brain of even the proverbial rocket scientist. In this way, the game always keeps you on your toes.    It's also important to note that each level is so vast, especially as you delve deeper into the game, that only a fraction of it will fit on your display at any one time. Sure, you can access a mini-map of the entire level whenever you want, but playing it bit by bit as its enormity automatically unfolds and scrolls upward or downward or side to side is a sincerely challenging task.  Arguably the biggest knock is the absence of difficulty adjustments. Granted, developer Playrix seems to have gauged its target audience well and instilled just enough difficulty to keep things consistently edgy. Moreover, the game does offer a \"Relaxed Mode\" that's free of time constraints and will likely appeal to children and anyone looking for a less strenuous time. But an option to either crank up the challenge or marginally reduce it should have been included. "

        "Content": "Every year, I start FIFA\u2014sorry, EA Sports FC\u2014with the same overly optimistic questions: What has actually changed this time around? Is it really new, or just the same old game with a fresh coat of paint? There\u2019s always a laundry list of flashy new marketing terms designed to grab attention: Hypermotion V, FC IQ, BallTouch, Rush, and so on (okay, one of those is made up). Yet, even with all the buzzwords, there\u2019s often a lingering feeling that these changes are merely surface-level, and this year is no different in that regard. A series of incremental improvements and adjustments do add to the fun through their novelty if nothing else, but they\u2019re hardly a sweeping revolution. While an exciting new mode like Rush can add an interesting twist, it\u2019s not enough to mask the fact that this is still very much a familiar experience, and for long-time fans like myself, the excitement is starting to wear pretty thin. Let\u2019s start with the new futsal-inspired mode, Rush, as it\u2019s the freshest thing about FC 25. Although it\u2019s technically a five-a-side mode, it\u2019s built with four outfield players in mind, with the goalkeeper controlled by the AI. It\u2019s available across all four core parts of FC 25\u2014Kick Off, Ultimate Team, Career, and Clubs\u2014making it perfect for people who don\u2019t always have a full squad but still want to jump into the action. For example, in Career Mode it\u2019s used in the introduction of youth tournaments, giving you a chance to test your wunderkinds in high-pressure scenarios throughout the season. It\u2019s a cool, fast-paced break from the standard matches and adds some much-needed variety to the often-repetitive nature of Career seasons. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Whether you\u2019re teaming up with friends or diving in solo, Rush brings a level of accessibility that\u2019s hard to resist. I found myself spending most of my time with it in Ultimate Team, using one of my stars alongside random teammates online. While there\u2019s no target beyond Rush points, and no league to climb, the mode still pulled me in emphatically. Rush uses unique rules that inject a welcome dose of chaos. Kick-offs are reimagined, with players racing toward the center of the pitch as the ball is launched into play\u2014reminiscent of Rocket League. Matches are fast-paced and concise, lasting just seven minutes followed by a short golden goal period if the scores are level at the end, with a tense, up-close penalty shootout afterward if still no one finds the net. The offside rule only applies in the final third, giving you more freedom in how you approach the goal. Red cards are replaced with blue cards, sending players to a one-minute sin bin for serious fouls\u2014though their time can be cut by 15 seconds for each goal the opposition scores while they're sidelined. There are also restrictions on the players you can use at the time of writing (Max 79-rated, untradeable), with this expected to be shaken up every so often. The new Rush mode is a fast and often high-scoring spectacle. \u201c All these adjustments make the new mode a fast and often high-scoring spectacle, with players darting across the sleek (and sponsored) Nike Air Zoom Arena. The neon-gilded stadium, modeled after Nike\u2019s Mercurial football boots, looks fantastic and the energetic atmosphere elevates the entire experience. The commentator, Fernando Palomo, is exceptional. While his insistence on screaming \u201cGOAAAAAL!\u201d 10 to 15 times a game will probably grate by the end of the season, I still love that the excitement is palpable from the first whistle. \"There's the ball, go get it!\" sets the tone for each match, and the hyperbolic passion for every opportunity keeps the energy alive. Plus, witnessing my tap-ins get hyped up and enshrined as a work of art never gets old. While Rush is best played at a relentless pace, if you're willing to slow things down and focus on defending, you can find immense satisfaction in marking up and shutting down attacks. Ironically, defending in Rush feels more rewarding than in traditional 11v11 modes. The smaller pitch creates a sense of openness that encourages tactical play and, overall, the mode feels more relaxed and enjoyable. My biggest question when playing is always \u201cWill my teammates actually bother to defend?\u201d Playing defensively in Rush feels like choosing to be a Medic in Battlefield\u2014it\u2019s not glamorous, but it\u2019s honest work. And when it clicks, it can make all the difference. What's more important to you in a sports game? Quality on-field gameplay Engaging out-of-match options and modes They are equally important Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results Right now, Rush stands out as the most innovative part of the Ultimate Team experience as well, especially in a year without major overhauls. While there are minor tweaks\u2014like the ability to stash up to 100 untradeable duplicates for squad-building challenges, and a more relaxed FUT Rivals friendlies mode decoupled from hardcore matchmaking\u2014the addition of Rush feels the most significant. Despite its simplicity, Rush is the mode I keep coming back to after a long day. It\u2019s pure fun, and ultimately, that\u2019s what matters most. Despite the lack of long-term objectives, I couldn\u2019t stop playing. It\u2019s compelling in all the right ways, and probably the best thing EA has added to the series in years. It's a seriously good time, and I hope it continues to get new content and attention to keep it fresh and thriving. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Graphically, EA Sports FC is once again a hot pot of good and bad, shining on the pitch while appearing neglected off it. During matches, the presentation is particularly sharp\u2014especially in Premier League games, where the new scoreboards, broadcast-style overlays, and team-specific on-screen graphics packages really stand out. A nice surprise is the option to re-enable team walkouts in the pre-match build-up after the feature was suddenly removed in FC 24. Unfortunately, the user interface is a different story. What\u2019s most infuriating is how the menus feel like they were designed for a touchscreen\u2014soft edges, clunky to navigate, and far from intuitive with a controller. Worse, they seem to provide less information than ever before. Despite the ever-increasing bloat of the menu items directly in front of you, key information is buried behind layers of tabs that disappear if you scroll too far, leaving you hunting for crucial options. FC 25 Screenshots 13 Images For a game that actively encourages you to slow down, tweak tactics, and customise player roles, the new menu system that plagues every game mode feels like it\u2019s chugging two steps behind my inputs, making what should be an enjoyable experience feel like a chore. This was especially notable in menu-heavy modes like Career which, while it has had several cool additions, is now aggravating to try and navigate through. There\u2019s also the new \u2018Cranium\u2019 system, which aims to make players without facial scans appear more natural alongside top-tier talent from the likes of the Premier League, La Liga, and beyond. It\u2019s nice to see a greater range of \u201cgeneric\u201d faces now, and even unscanned players look a little like their real-life counterparts. Likewise, it\u2019s neat that there\u2019s a greater level of customization in the personal player or manager models as well. However, the results are inconsistent: Under ideal conditions and lighting, some players look significantly better than in previous entries, but these conditions are rare, and more often than not everyone in FC 25 looks like they\u2019ve been pulled from a waxy, uncanny valley hell.\\ Speaking of jank, expect some of the typical weirdness in FC 25. \u201c Speaking of the jank, expect some of the typical weirdness in FC 25. Commentary is still often disconnected from the action on the pitch, Ultimate Team still likes to freeze on me at every opportunity, and cutscenes still glitch out in the most bizarre ways. For those of us who\u2019ve been around the FIFA/FC block, these graphical quirks are nothing new, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less annoying. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a similar story across many annual sports titles. In Madden, bizarre animation bugs still see players warping or phasing through each other, while NBA 2K has its own share of uncanny character models and awkward animations. It feels like these issues are simply glossed over with each new installment. In fact, they\u2019re becoming increasingly indefensible as the same problems resurface year after year. Tweaks That Matter (And Many That Don\u2019t) When it comes to the actual, on-field action, FC 25 delivers some fun, if incremental, improvements\u2014just like clockwork. One of the standout new features is FC IQ, which effectively replaces the old system of work rates, where players movement was dictated by set verbal descriptions of their effort in attack and defense. Instead, player movement is now determined by their \u201crole\u201d and the \u201cfocus\u201d assigned to them within that role. Each position offers a choice of three to five roles. For example, a central attacking midfielder (CAM) can be assigned roles like shadow striker, playmaker, and others, altering how forward-thinking you want them to be throughout a game. There\u2019s a new level of automation that goes hand-in-hand with this change and actually feels significant. For example, attackers are a bit more useful while on the break, and no longer having to constantly trigger players\u2019 runs in behind or down the wing with manual button presses is great. Players will make smarter runs based on their roles, too. However, the level of control still pales in comparison to the more tactical-heavy sims found in Football Manager, and the initial impressiveness of the change wears off fast. It\u2019s certainly an improvement, but the desired depth isn\u2019t quite there yet. The implementation of new player roles in Ultimate Team, evolving based on real-life performances, is also a neat touch\u2014for example, Bellingham playing deeper one week could see him re-emerge as a playmaker. What we said about EA Sports FC 24 If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA\u2019s soccer sim to go along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If you\u2019ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to improve its RPG elements, even if it\u2019s only currently for Ultimate Team where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions. Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again suffer from the same lack of care they\u2019ve been missing for years, with the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just about the same, frustrating but beautiful game. - Andrew McMahon, September 26, 2023 Score: 7 Read the full EA Sports FC 24 review . In terms of how the on-pitch action feels with the controller in your hand, passing is a touch snappier than last year, especially when pinging long balls across the pitch. Shooting also has a nice weight to it\u2014smooth, responsive, and satisfying. When the weather effects are in play in offline modes, even the physics in wet conditions adds a layer of unpredictability, with the ball sometimes skidding to a halt as the rain pours down. It\u2019s these moments when you\u2019re battling the elements that are a great example of the enjoyment found in the imperfections of the beautiful game. But then there\u2019s the defense, which still feels frustratingly loose. A tale as old as time, pacy players can turn and breeze past a defense with ease, and defenders are often a step behind, even slower than they should be. Near-track-athlete-level speedsters like Micky Van de Ven sometimes find themselves unable to catch up with the less-than-zippy attackers. If the opponent gets in behind your defense, you might as well start planning your next kickoff because there\u2019s little you can do to stop them. Defensive issues are compounded by the new FC IQ tactical options, which are supposed to give you more control over how your team plays, not quite extending to defenders how I\u2019d like. For example, there are no longer instructions to tell players to press heavily after losing the ball. Defending is half of football, yet it currently feels like an afterthought here that needed a lot more time in the oven. No matter if you\u2019re playing a low, medium, or high-aggression style, it just feels the same: slow, boring, and lacking tight control. At times, it felt like someone was holding onto my players' heels, keeping them back; When they finally did accelerate, it was rigid and unnatural, like they were moving along a predetermined path. Let Down By The Rest As someone who prefers the depth of Career Mode (I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours playing out multiple season-long campaigns over the years) over the microtransaction-driven Ultimate Team, I was excited to see that FC 25 finally gives it the attention it deserves and brings some meaningful updates. But the changes are still bittersweet. One of the biggest improvements this year is simply in the ways you can customize the experience. There\u2019s more flexibility in how you set up your career\u2014board expectations, for instance, can now be set to lenient, sparing you the frustration of being sacked for not spending every penny of your transfer budget. The ability to customize training plans and match tactics to a greater degree, deciding how hard your players train and which roles suit them best, is a welcome step towards giving us more control over our players\u2019 development, particularly when it comes to managing youth talent and squad rotation. Then there\u2019s also the addition of those weather effects like wind and rain, which genuinely affect how matches play out. In smaller stadiums, for example, a strong gust can make the ball swerve unpredictably. It\u2019s a satisfying touch and adds a new level of realism for offline modes like Career that feels long overdue. That said, it\u2019s a shame this isn\u2019t available in online modes. I understand how it could frustrate those who don\u2019t enjoy forces outside of their control becoming a deciding factor, but I\u2019d love to see it as an optional setting for casual Ultimate Team matchups, there to spice things up just that bit more for those of us who like to live dangerously. Beyond the weather, another interesting feature is the integration of a social media feed featuring none other than the seemingly omnipresent transfer guru Fabrizio Romano. His trademark \"Here We Go\" catchphrase now pops up during in-game transfer announcements. It\u2019s a fun, slightly gimmicky (and perhaps borderline cringeworthy) addition\u2014but I\u2019m still waiting for a \u201cThere We Land\u201d before I\u2019m truly impressed. FC 25\u2019s welcoming of several major women\u2019s leagues is long overdue and much appreciated, and the ability to seamlessly drift between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s leagues and teams within one career mode save is particularly neat. Plus, you can now start a save as one of FC\u2019s many icons, allowing me to finally live out my dream of Andrea Pirlo running the show at the base of Gillingham\u2019s midfield.

The clunky menus, which are inexplicably worse in Career, slow down even the simplest tasks. Whether it\u2019s searching for players or navigating tactics, the interface feels more cumbersome than ever. The expanded tactical roles, while great in theory, don\u2019t translate into the impactful gameplay changes you\u2019d expect, especially when your defenders feel a step behind the action. For a mode that should pride itself on its immersive simulation, these moments of inconsistency jar you back to reality. EA has clearly tried to modernize Career Mode with new features, but these efforts are undermined by how outdated and unintuitive the rest of the experience feels. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to love this mode\u2014it\u2019s where I\u2019ve always found the deepest connection to the series. Yet, it\u2019s hard to feel fully invested when these long-standing problems still exist. FC 25\u2019s Career Mode takes a step in the right direction with its new additions, but they aren\u2019t enough to overcome the inertia holding it back. After more than 20 years of playing EA Sports football titles, the cracks in this series are no longer subtle\u2014they\u2019re now threatening its foundation"

All at once it's a grand strategy-scale geopolitics simulator, an alien-invasion battler, and a hard sci-fi solar system industrialization simulator with integrated real-time newtonian-physics-driven fleet combat. But while I got sucked into its world, that fresh mix of ideas suffers from some very conventional strategy game failures in its interface, accessibility, and balance. One part of Terra Invicta is an engaging simulation of a world where secret coalitions manipulate its nations. They fight in the shadows over humanity's response to the threat of an alien invasion, managing national allegiances, research, economies, espionage, and militaries. You take control of one of these seven factions, each of which has its own unique asymmetric victory conditions, and command their leadership council to build a movement that can reach your goals in a fascinating, ever-shifting political landscape. Terra Invicta Gameplay Screenshots 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The other part of it is a detailed simulation of human expansion into the solar system, including the militarization and industrialization of space, the likes of which I've never seen in a video game. It's complete with real-time space combat and years-long travel between solar bodies. Using a jaw-dropping array of near-future and science fiction techs, you're expected to figure out how best to build ships, colonies, and stations able to produce the space resources you need to win the fight. Either of these two games would be pretty fun on its own, and they both have interesting ideas alongside very cool, well-designed systems, but at times they're so different that the whiplash I experienced just from playing minute to minute got extreme. Terra Invicta's weakest links are the places where these two intricate games come together, and they\u2019re so different that you could very easily love one and hate the other. Even if you love both ideas like me, it isn't exactly easy to walk the walk of alien arrival geopolitics and chew the gum of Newtonian physics-based battles at the same time. Your early hours will likely be spent just trying to keep your head above water. \u201c Combine that with an interface that's fighting to keep up with the sheer complexity of the mechanics, let alone allow you to manipulate them, and much of your early time with Terra Invicta is likely to be spent just trying to keep your head above water. I lost my first campaign of Terra Invicta after just over 50 hours played, in part due to the frustrating learning experience of working out the interface between space and Earth\u2019s political shenanigans. My battle of resistance ended as alien factions on Earth crippled too many nations, while my efforts in space lost steam amid a confusion of weird mechanics and ship-design woes. It all culminated in a death spiral I didn't realize I'd entered until it was 10 hours too late to escape. Death spirals are never fun, but it did reveal the clever nature of Terra Invicta's overall scenario, where Earth's vast resources can allow you to meet your goals\u2026 if you're able to leverage them. The aliens may have massive technological advantages at first, but there are literally billions of humans, and they're sitting on the single largest concentration of usable resources in the solar system and already have an economy in place to use them. Spacer Soldier Spy Perhaps the coolest thing in Terra Invicta are the seven conspiratorial factions. In turn, they aspire to submit to, work alongside, prove themselves to, flee from, fight back against, exterminate, or profit from the aliens. Each faction is nicely represented by a key character, all of whom are fleshed out by quotes and voiced dialogue every time new research or major events pop off. It's nice that you get flavor from every faction leader over time, as it's possible that a weak faction won't be one you engage with directly. Every one of the factions has wildly different plans. When playing as The Resistance you're trying to strengthen Earth to fight off the aliens, unite its people, and preserve the human way of life as much as possible. Humanity First, meanwhile, has a similar goal but with more genocidal flavor, and is willing to do anything to wipe the aliens out \u2014 like encouraging terrorist bombings on pro-alien nations or nuclear strikes against alien targets. It's easy for extremist factions to rack up atrocities, a very clever mechanic that hits perpetrators of war crimes with permanent penalties to their global reputation. At the other extreme are The Servants, who think that aliens are divine beings and whose intentionally easier campaign has you align with the alien cause. Where other factions are fighting what Aliens do, Servants are desperate to contact and communicate with them in a twisting campaign story that takes Terra Invicta to unexpected places given its larger premise. The ideological differences between factions can lead to interesting conflicts. \u201c These ideological differences can lead to some interesting conflicts. In my campaign as The Resistance, I did things like form international coalitions to invade nations and overthrow governments friendly to the aliens. In one exceptional moment I had to unite a feuding US and Europe in an alliance to invade an alien-controlled nation seeking nuclear weapons. In another I had to convince Brazil's neighbors to let them move armies that could exterminate growing alien plant life. I forged alliances of convenience with groups like Project Exodus, who \u2013 while they were squandering resources on trying to escape alien conquest \u2013 at least weren't actively working for the bad guys. It\u2019s cool that you can never really \u201ckill\u201d an idea, either. You can weaken or even cripple one of the other factions by stealing their resources, or by assassination, but they will inevitably recruit a new inner circle and rebuild in time. Your faction's council is how to put your plans into action, picking recruits from a broader pool of candidates with their own loyalties, backgrounds, and traits. I had one counselor who was a paranoid cynic, for example, and while that made her an excellent spy and counterspy it also made her hard to trust with valuable assets, as her true loyalty was difficult to gauge. She also refused to work in unstable and dangerous environments, which are fairly common in a world where the revelation of hostile alien life starts to plunge countries into chaos. Aliens have arrived on Earth! What is your faction's goal? Escape the planet Submit and follow them Profit from their arrival Encourage peaceful co-existence Build a respectful alliance Prevent their domination Destroy them all Answer See Results I got pretty attached to my council members. One of my favorites was an Argentine military colonel who led my, uh\u2026 deniable operations. (It\u2019s hard for enemy factions to gain popular support when their agents get abducted or killed if they go public.) Her military experience was key, as Counselors' jobs affect the missions they can take on. Spies and soldiers have obvious uses in a shadowy global war, while diplomats and social or religious leaders are great at spreading your cause's ideology, giving you more of the influence resource. Meanwhile top scientists contribute to research efforts as economists and businessmen help find funding or acquire and manage organizations that act like equipment for your council. You have limited slots on your council, though, and you can't be good at everything. Counselors can only undertake two missions each month, so you constantly have to make hard choices about priorities. Should I send my Resistance spy to investigate a suspected enemy agent or to weaken Servant control in Argentina? I also love that you can recruit and maintain criminals to support your cause: Sure, the Los Zetas Cartel are bad people, but it's hard to complain when we've got them funneling $40 million a month toward fighting the alien menace. Terra Invicta clearly wants to simulate every aspect of our world \u2013 at least at the macro level. \u201c All this geopoliticking and fighting takes place on a detailed and fairly robust simulation of Earth. The overview screen tracks things like global opinion about each faction, Earth's overall GDP, and the economies of nations, but also details like the level of human-caused climate change. (Or\u2026 is it human-caused?) Terra Invicta starts in 2022, which is accurate down to details like Russian forces occupying Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, and it's very clear that it wants to simulate every aspect of our world \u2013 at least at the macro level. The coolest example of this is how research works, with two kinds of projects going at any time. There are public projects every faction contributes to that show the bigger arc of what humanity is working towards as well as private projects that benefit your faction alone. You have to split your research output between them, as does everyone else. The big public projects unlock things for everyone, and those are often double edged swords. They can be political movements that allow unification of countries into single nations, like a united EU\u2026 or break them up into smaller, weaker targets for alien conquest. They can also be the development of tech allowing things like cleaner nuclear fission to buffer against inevitable energy crises. If you contribute the most to a public project you get to choose what's next on the docket for humanity's future, and you get an edge in unlocking private projects that spin off of that tech. It's a serious benefit in the sprawling web of a tech tree \u2013 which I loved in spite of its lack of organization thanks to a decent search function. All of those public techs let your faction unlock private research to get smaller-scale benefits at the same time. Those can be exclusive access to political movements, corporations, or benefits for your agents like defoliants for alien plants. On the space side they're often ultra-specific tech like new rocket engines, weapons, or asteroid-mining techniques. I liked how many choices of private research I had at any given time, adding a good tension to each decision. Some are less exciting variants of similar options, but it's fun when you're picking between new plasma rocket engines, an economic method to bolster military defense, or enhanced cybernetics for your counselors \u2014 and you want them all yesterday. With all of that intricate detail it seems very strange when the simulation leaves out obvious cascading effects. For instance, the economies of individual countries are tracked by GDP, wealth disparity, and productive capacity, but at the same time countries are individual units to such a degree that apocalyptic economic events in one country don't appear to affect their neighbors at all. That level of simulation is something developer Pavonis Interactive will want to improve over the course of Early Access. Likewise, countries themselves are brain dead without a global conspirator pulling the strings. It's very hard to get a foothold in countries with large populations and economies, so in at least one of my games I saw China sit stagnant for over a decade following the alien invasion. It's hard to imagine that one of the world's most powerful nations would sit and do nothing \u2013 not even develop its space program \u2013 as madcap events kick off everywhere around it. The simulation of Earth is fun to see in action, but it's also overwhelming. \u201c All that simulation works well for the most part is, and is fun to watch in action. I can see that for many people the biggest draw here will be the conspiracy-vs-conspiracy thriller world that you can engage in and develop. You could create a unified African continent, or break up the EU. Playing as the Servants I engineered a permanent peace and eventual reunification of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh into a diverse and democratic world superpower. (I mean, I did it for bad reasons, but the sentiment is nice.) But that simulation is also overwhelming. The struggle to track what's relevant and interesting to your cause is difficult and only worsened by the interface, which tries heroically to surface relevant information but really struggles to do it in a way that's useful. For example, there's no real warning nor indication that the AI is engaging in nuclear war aside from the occasional loud noise, whereupon you then frantically turn the globe looking for mushroom clouds that may fade before you spot them (that might be something you'd want to know more about before the nuclear winter sets in). Wild swings in public opinion that might cause you to lose vital control points in a key nation are relegated to small icons. There can be very little warning that a nation is approaching civil war and regime flip, losing you power. Enemies can get and keep control in nations you hold much easier than you'd think. These frustrations bite new players the most, but are annoyances even for veterans. You can defend your control, but it's micromanagement intensive. Optimal strategies involve counterintuitive choices like taking, then abandoning countries, but only by watching the AI do that did I figure it out. I eventually resorted to manually checking the opinion charts and economies of every nation I had, every turn, to keep up. Terra Invicta Screens 26 Images The biggest detail Terra Invicta ignores, though, is storytelling about the aliens themselves. For much of the early campaign it feels like they may as well not exist. That\u2019s fun during those early X-Files-esque conspiracy years but by the time I'm being told they're doing terror attacks on civilian populations I'd at least hope to have seen more than a single piece of grainy art depicting one. Even when you later see, capture, or kill an alien agent it's quite vague. A mission description might casually reference some kind of alien you've neither seen nor heard of before, let alone gotten a text description of. For all that time it spends describing the cool things that its key characters and people are doing, and the revolutionary technologies they're inventing, sometimes Terra Invicta feels like it's forgotten that it's a game about an alien invasion. \u2026in SPAAAAACE! At least until you go to space, that is. In space there's lots going on, much of it in the purple of the alien conquerors \u2013 but again, it's just a wholly different video game from the surface. Space is about strategically and precisely beating others to the resources you need to win, taking hold of them, and never letting go. That fight starts on Earth, as you need its resources to get your first stations and colonies going, but later your space efforts become self-sustaining. As part of those efforts you\u2019ll build fleets of ships, and can eventually use those to fight against alien ships, though doing so risks severe repercussions as Alien fleets move to destroy your space assets in retaliation. Building space stations, resource colonies, and shipyards is unparalleled here. Balancing expansion against control, boosting from Earth versus space resource utilization, and local-system construction capacities is as engaging a toybox as you could want. With 350-some stellar objects, there is no simulation in another strategy game to rival Terra Invicta's both deep and broad model of space exploration. That said, if you don't have a solid grounding in hard sci-fi or a great head for physics, the space combat is going to be frustrating and strange. It's as much about weapons and preparation before the fights as it is about actual choices made during them. You worry about the specific thrust of engines versus how much Delta-V a craft can muster, and how that affects the balance of its performance in battle versus out. In real-time combat, precisely tweaking maneuver nodes to get specific results can be rough, and the interface here is both slippery and frustrating. I gave up on complex kinetic and energy weapons tactics based on maneuvers by my second fight. I realized that while you can build space warships early on it's a trap option, a built-in waste of your time. I resorted to overwhelming the enemy with missiles, and that worked pretty well. Later I tried to build some big, giant, awesome space battleships. Spoilers: My macross fantasies were bad. It went apocalyptically wrong. Seconds into its first combat my Titan-class ship evaporated after a single hit from a tiny alien Destroyer. I never could figure out why, and Terra Invicta wasn\u2019t interested in teaching me. My kingdom for a combat log. The space gameplay is cool on paper but frustrating in practice. \u201c The space gameplay is cool on paper but frustrating in practice, because by the time you actually start getting real excess resources to play with in space you're a dozen hours into this game. Don't get me wrong, it's good game design to have the complexity of a campaign open up over time, but not when it can be so crucial and swing so hard from victory to defeat so suddenly. Winning the fights you start in space is necessary for the success of most campaigns, but you have no idea how to do it and Terra Invicta won't teach you how. The only way to learn is to throw yourself at enemy fleets in skirmish mode \u2013 you can even export ship designs from an in-progress save \u2013 but that ultimately doesn't have bearing on the strategic situation of your personal campaign. Perhaps more frustrating is how the Earth layer can intrude into the space one. Enemies will seize control of your stations much like they seize national resources on Earth, but the difference is that the stations took huge private resource investments on your part. Sending a counselor to take them back means months at the shortest, years at the longest, which is crippling to your efforts on Earth while that counselor is unavailable. Sending in your own space fleets to assault with marines works, but in my experience just led to silly situations where control of a 50-person outpost flip-flopped back and forth every few months. What's the best Alien Invasion movie? Independence Day Edge of Tomorrow The War of the Worlds Attack the Block Invasion of the Body Snatchers They Live Other (leave a comment!) Answer See Results Those kinds of political maneuvers make sense and provide drama on the Earth layer, where huge numbers of people and complex governments are at play, but in space they're just frustrating. Why are we letting strangers onto our secretive space weapons research facility, then letting them give stirring speeches to seize control, and why aren't all the marines we stationed there doing anything about it? You can technically do the same to the AI, but practically speaking it requires a lot of good luck and planning, as a very specific, rare counselor trait is required to do it. Oh, and don't you dare blow up any non-alien space facilities, no matter how reviled their occupants are. That's an atrocity on par with a nuclear holocaust and, to quote Fallout 4 : \"Everyone disliked that.\""

That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t plenty of smart ideas in this action-based, single-player, faux MMO, but its tangle of gameplay systems feels like a dense pile of stuffing that never gets stitched together into a coherent whole, and its story lacks the urgency and gravity that made the anime great. Hollow Realization takes place after the main story arcs of the Sword Art Online anime series, and sees its many likeable characters return to a virtual world that\u2019s in many ways reminiscent of Aincrad, where they were once horrifically trapped. The show\u2019s original premise, where perishing in-game resulted in real-world death, is a setup that immediately introduced tangible stakes and a sense of urgency - two things that Hollow Realization sorely lacks. At first, I enjoyed the fact that the characters weren\u2019t in any immediate danger; I relished the opportunity to see them relax and actually enjoy their game for once, especially given how the opening cinematic strongly implies that the other shoe is going to drop momentarily anyway. But after dozens of hours of casual camaraderie over farming runs and item shop bargain-hunting I grew impatient with the story\u2019s snail-like pacing and relentless cheer - both of which betray what made the anime great. I grew impatient with the story\u2019s snail-like pacing and relentless cheer. \u201c I certainly can\u2019t fault the amount of story content though, which is both fully voiced and quite plentiful - so much so that 50 hours wasn\u2019t enough for me to see its completion. It\u2019s the style and frequency with which the story is presented, though, that makes it feel obtrusive. At times, it felt like I could barely play for more than an hour without being stopped for long stretches to watch mostly static character portraits talk at each other. I get it: they\u2019re all friends. That doesn\u2019t mean I want to get roped into a 15-minute-long dialogue scene over what kind of food one of them wants sell at her in-game shop. My pre-existing affection for the characters was enough to keep my attention initially, but before long my event log was clogged up from pending conversation events with party members - which I dutifully started ignoring so I could get back out into the field. Out in Hollow Realization\u2019s large and interconnected combat zones, enemies are plentiful, as are randomly occurring events for you to participate in for extra XP and sometimes a shot at a rare high-level monster. Though the events are mostly simple \u201ckill X of these\u201d quests, they gave shape to my exploration and kept me coming back to areas I\u2019d already cleared in search for better item drops. That focus on rewards became vital as I opened up the six main areas, each of which house 10 to 20 roamable areas. It\u2019s an overwhelming amount of real estate to cover, which adds quite a bit to the fake MMO veneer. More Than Mashing The one-button combat seems simplistic at first, but there are a number of little nuances that prove worthy of the time required to master them. Properly timing the last hit of an attack chain gets you a sizeable damage bonus, while perfectly parrying incoming attacks stuns your attacker while replenishing your mana, giving you the resources and time you need to press the offensive. Landing a special attack within a certain window while an enemy recovers from using one of theirs temporarily weakens them, opening them up to bonus damage from all sources. Moments like this are perfect opportunities for commanding your AI party members to coordinate their assaults with yours. Communication goes both ways too; they\u2019ll prompt you to switch places with them, attack in unison with them, and more. It\u2019s even possible to remind them to heal, ask them to draw aggro, even take evasive maneuvers when you see a big AoE attack inbound. Leveraging all of these little elements properly allows you to efficiently down groups of enemies well above your level, and perfectly reading a powerful foe\u2019s attacks and shutting them down while building a long, damaging combo feels really satisfying. The big area bosses simultaneously represent the zenith of Hollow Realization\u2019s combat systems, and the most concentrated expression of what\u2019s wrong with them. They\u2019re hulking in size, and their multi-formed assaults require you to work with three other parties of AI-controlled adventurers just to have a chance. This would be exciting if those other parties had half a brain, but more often than not they get themselves wiped in the opening minutes of what sometimes amounts to a 20-minute battle. Finishing the fight on the strength of your party alone is certainly doable with the right tactics/gear, but the over-zealous auto-targeting system doesn\u2019t help either. Finding a short window of opportunity to attack a specific limb of a boss only for your character to sail past it to hit another definitely made certain bosses more frustrating than they needed to be. What Does It All Mean? Underpinning the action are a group of systems designed to both simulate many elements of MMORPGs and to provide ways for you to build your relationships (romantic and otherwise) with your party members, and even random NPCs. Here especially, it\u2019s clear that the developers put a tremendous amount of effort into the nuts and bolts of Hollow Realization - a fact that makes the lukewarm results all the more disappointing. There\u2019s plenty of complexity here, but very little of it makes the experience significantly deeper. For instance, by complimenting your comrades in battle you can encourage certain personality traits in them which, over time, affects the frequency with which they perform certain types of actions and a slew of other stats and effects. Right there, I\u2019ve just given you about as much of an explanation as the game gave me. Even after figuring some of it out contextually and checking both Japanese and American message boards, no one seems to fully understand what all of these icons and stats actually mean. As a habitual min-maxxer, I was as surprised at my inability to fully comprehend this system as I was that my inability to do so wound up being irrelevant to success. Skill trees and the oddly nuanced blacksmithing system suffer a similar problem: their menus are a mess of icons, numbers and abbreviations with little to no explanation. The description for the skill \u201cDecoy\u201d reads: \u201c (Mob)Aggro Down (CRT) -10% / 30sec. Increase Aggro \u201d What?! I know what a mob is. I know what aggro means. I can surmise that CRT means \u201ccrit,\u201d and not \u201ccathode ray tube.\u201d But what is the supposed relationship between them here? Do my critical hits lower the target\u2019s aggro while this skill is active? Do they just generate less aggro? If so, why does it say \u201cIncrease Aggro?\u201d I ran a heavy crit build and I never noticed any difference in monster aggro after popping Decoy, so I guess the fine details are irrelevant anyway? I love getting lost in the minutiae of RPG skill trees, but not if they\u2019re unintelligible and ultimately meaningless. I felt like I was only passively participating in the development of my character. \u201c At least the different passive skills of the many blacksmiths you can find have an accompanying legend to tell you what they\u2019re for, but that only revealed how needlessly opaque the system is in the first place. \u201cIntuition\u201d and \u201cEye For Detail\u201d aren\u2019t really great descriptors for what\u2019s actually just a bonus crafting success chance. I ended up simply sticking with what I was able to piece together and ignoring the rest, which (despite being more than sufficient for me to succeed) left me feeling like I was only passively participating in the development of my character and his comrades. Even after considering these shortcomings, I still appreciated the lengths the developers went towards imbuing Hollow Realization with the kind of complexity that\u2019s usually limited to MMOs, but it also makes it all the stranger that the actual online portion is so limited. You can form a party of up to four human players online and fight super-high-level named mobs without all the story interruptions, but to do so you have to quit out of your single-player game completely and then launch multiplayer from the main menu. There was an interesting opportunity here to seamlessly blur the line between real and simulated MMOs, but Hollow Realization sadly misses it."

        "Content": "PlayStation VR Worlds seems like the demo disc that should\u2019ve been included with the PlayStation VR. Some of its five bundled games are great demonstrations of what the PlayStation VR can do, but the others are throwaways that I\u2019ll quickly forget I played. The star of the show is The London Heist. Aside from a brief puzzle scene in which you open a safe to steal a diamond, it\u2019s little more than a shooting gallery with the Move controllers. There's one scene about shooting your way out of a robbery gone wrong and another where you ride shotgun in the getaway car and blast away at pursuers. Shooting is simple, but the experience of firing a virtual gun with a Move controller is still a great novelty, and reloading by popping magazines into your gun with the other hand is satisfying. It's a little annoying that there's no ammo counter for your gun to warn you when you're running low, but that made me try to keep track of how many shots I'd fired and made it slightly less mindless. Simply shooting things is far more fun this way than it is with a traditional game controller, so I can forgive a lack of significant enemy or weapon variety. I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me. \u201c Surrounding the gunfights, The London Heist is dressed up with impressive cinematic monologs from a pair of highly detailed gangster characters. They\u2019re well acted and impressively animated as they argue and posture, and though I didn't have enough time to get attached to them as characters in the short running time I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me asking for a light for their cigar or threatening me in a subway service station. After the hour-long story\u2019s done there\u2019s a set of three shooting gallery levels with leaderboards to play on. Free of the need to make things fit into a serious story, these ranges have a lot more fun with the idea: they throw in elements like friendly targets and paint cans moving along tracks that you have to shoot at the right time to knock them into appropriately colored bins. There's some replay value in setting high scores on there, which is good, because that's about all the replay value that PlayStation VR Worlds has to offer. Scavengers Odyssey, for instance, is a short and linear first-person shooter where you use the DualShock 4 to pilot a mech suit through a story of uninteresting sci-fi mysticism. Enemy variety is weak \u2013 only three aliens, counting the final boss, and a stationary turret \u2013 and there are only two weapons including a gravity gun, so combat is bland. The best thing about it is launching yourself between platforms, which I enjoyed for the sensation of movement as you trigger a leap to a pre-designated spot, and for the ability to double-jump and change directions mid-air. But it\u2019s over in less than two hours, and there\u2019s no reason I\u2019d want to play it again. More PlayStation VR Launch Reviews  See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents, Danger Ball will be short-lived. \u201c Danger Ball is basically first-person Pong for the VR era, and controlling your paddle by looking where you want it to go works great. This is the kind of game that can only really work with stereoscopic 3D, because you need to be able to tell how far away the incoming ball is, and the PlayStation VR handles that well. I was able to time the impact well enough to do a last-second flick of my head to put some English on the ball and make it curve in a direction of my choosing, which often threw off the AI player and scored an easy point. The different opponents do shake things up with unique powers, such as being able to launch two balls at you at once or a shield you need to break down before you can get it by them. However, they're not too bright, and it only took a couple of tries to beat the tournament mode. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents directly instead of just through the leaderboard on the simple score-chase mode, this one will be short-lived. VR Luge is about as simple and arcadey as you can get. You're put in the perspective of a luge racer coasting down busy streets, dodging cars by looking right and left. I think the biggest disappointment, besides the fact that head-on collisions with trucks barely slow you down, is that I didn't get as much of a sense of speed as I'd expected from being inches off the ground and allegedly moving at over 100 miles per hour. There\u2019s some scenery and spectacle, but not much gameplay variety - you\u2019re just dodging left and right using your head. Ocean Descent isn\u2019t a game, but an interesting passive experience in which you\u2019re lowered hundreds of feet into the ocean in shark-proof cage. There\u2019s some beautifully animated sea life and a little drama created by your crew on the radio, and it made me flinch a few times, but not much more than that. When you're done you can take the same trip again without the excitement or just sit underwater and watch the fish swim, but that would've been much more relaxing and meditative if there were an option to remove the ugly shark cage."

        "Content": "Before digging into a game that lets you control a complex machine, you've got to know what kind of experience you're looking for. Do you want to be able to fiddle with every flap and check every dial on a plane's dashboard, or just sit back and relax while whizzing around the skies and shooting stuff? Simulation games cater to the more hardcore crowd out there, for the types of people who want to put just as much effort in simply keeping the machine running as they do engaging in the challenges dictated by mission objectives. More casual players tend to be drawn to arcade style game where controls are simple and accessible, letting them instead focus almost entirely on the combat, be it dogfighting in dive bombing ground targets. With Transmission Games ' Heroes Over Europe , the focus is most definitely on providing an arcade-style experience, but its thin gameplay and a few other missteps prevent it from becoming a memorable title.  Before soaring into the game's online modes, there's a 14 mission campaign to plow through. The presentation here is low-budget but decent enough, with panning still images and war film serving to introduce missions set in World War II European battle theatres, from over the cliffs of Dover to the skies above Berlin. You'll follow specific pilots through all these conflicts, their characters built through voiceover and personal histories. While at best mildly interesting, the writing tends to be snappy and voice work well done (except for the French accents \u2013 yikes), adding a welcome element of personality and wit to the overall tale.   Targeting engines for an Ace Kill. The game doesn't stick to a linear chronological progression, choosing instead to skip between years of the war to tell its story, which can be a little disorienting for anyone trying to follow along. After each mission you'll unlock new planes, some of which are meant for air-to-air combat and some better suited for bombing runs. Mission objectives here should be fairly familiar to anyone experienced with flight games, as you'll need to protect squadrons of bombers, torpedo ships at sea, wipe out AA guns on the ground, eliminate enemy aces from the sky and drop bombs on groups of tanks. You'll also get some even more oddball tasks, such as actually dropping down to street level while flying and weaving between buildings. While that particular building-dodging mission doesn't play very well, considering the style of gameplay Heroes Over Europe is gunning for, it's not all that surprising it was included.  While the mission objectives here are standard for flight combat games, they're unfortunately repeated far too often. Glad you finally wiped out that wave of bombers? Well, prepare yourself; here come two more, followed by an even larger wing of fighters. Relieved you were able to destroy all those searchlights and gun emplacements on that guard tower? Now get ready to do it all over again, only now you're up against two towers instead of one. This type of thing happens regularly throughout the campaign, so it feels as though instead of presenting new and interesting gameplay opportunities the game just throws more of the same stuff at you.   You'll be spending a lot of time in the campaign protecting and escorting. To try to momentarily shake off the sense of tedium that inevitably sets in, there are a few bizarre attack mechanics you can use to clear the skies. By hovering your aiming reticule over a nearby target, a gauge builds up, and when it's halfway full it's possible to enter Ace Kill mode. This zooms the camera in as time slows to a crawl, letting you target your foe's engines, gunner, or pilot, almost like sniping in a first-person shooter. If you hover the reticule long enough and fill the gauge entirely, the Ace Kill mode will stay active after you've made an initial kill, letting you quickly chain together attacks. In this sense it feels more like an attempt at genre fusion, bringing elements like combos from action games and headshots from shooters into an arcade flight combat experience. If that really was the goal here, there's room for improvement.  While I appreciate how this type of thing could be interesting, I found using machine guns to be most effective at shredding a target, making the time-consuming process of initiating the Ace Kill mode generally impractical during a large battle. The same goes for the Energy Attack, where if you dive from above at enemies you'll be granted increased offensive capabilities. Positioning yourself to pull that sort of thing off is more trouble than it's worth considering how many bogeys are roaring around, often chipping away at the life bar of something you're trying to protect. Though you will have friendly wingmates buzzing on all sides, it seems they're incapable of making a kill, requiring you to do all the work yourself. Even with its casual-friendly setup and focus on action, it's not long until in some missions the experience feels tiresome, as though you're a part on an assembly line.   It's also disappointing that there isn't a greater diversity of feel across the various aircraft. When piloting the bulky torpedo bombers, bi-planes, or more agile fighters, they all handle quite similarly, and don't feel like they move with much of a sense of speed. For further control tweaking, there's an arcade and a professional setting. Though both are highly accessible, adjustments can be made with flying on arcade to further simplify controls and prevent your plane from being able to perform a barrel roll, whereas the professional setting lets you directly control the plane's rudder. There's no real limiting factor to your maneuvering in both control modes, so there's nothing like stalls or pilot blackouts if your movements are too erratic. Heroes Over Europe isn't trying to be the all-encompassing experience that IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey is; it's an arcade-style flying game with no aspirations of simulation. That's not a bad thing if you're not concerned with the depth of a game's flight controls, but given the issues present here, it's hard to recommend considering the competition that happens to cover the same theatre of war.  Also sprinkled throughout the missions are bonus objectives that, if completed, unlock more planes for your use. Given the issues already mentioned, it's difficult to imagine many players would want to return to any of the missions if bonus objectives aren't completed the first time through. Multiple difficulty settings exist in case you're interested anyway.   The game puts plenty of fighters in the air at once. It doesn't help that this game isn't particularly attractive. The explosions, damage effects, plane models, and landscapes will fail to impress, and the forgettable background music and sound effects do little to make this a more exciting experience. What the game does do, however, is put plenty of fighters and bombers onscreen at once, which works to  generate a sense of excitement and impression that you're part of a huge and chaotic conflict. It's just too bad it all looks so bland.  If this review hasn't dampened your enthusiasm for the product, there are a few multiplayer modes to take part in, including deathmatch and last man standing game types of the free-for-all and team varieties. When creating a game you can pick from plane packs that make available only certain models for a fight, but unfortunately there don't seem to be all that many people playing at the moment."

        "Title": "Art Style: Zengage Review",
        "Content": "Thanks to the Nintendo DS systems' touch screen, one style of mini-game that's in abundance on the system is the dreaded \"slide puzzle.\" You know the type: you've got a picture that's divided into tiles, and you have to slide the tiles in such a way that the picture forms. I've always found slide puzzles frustrating and not much fun even though they can be satisfying when the solution's complete. To experience a ton of them on the DS because they're easy to reproduce on the slide-friendly touch panel doesn't make me a very happy panda. Skip, an extremely talented and creative group in Japan, took the concept of the slide puzzle and enhanced it for its Art Style series to create Art Style: Zengage . I can certainly appreciate what they did, and for the most part Zengage is one of the most challenging puzzle games you can find on the Nintendo DS. But it still reeks of slide puzzle syndrome, and it's a tough barrier to overcome simply because you really want to like the latest entry in a fantastic series as Art Style is.  Zengage has a brilliantly relaxing soundtrack, but that's only to keep you calm during the mind-bending and frustrating puzzle challenges. Your task is to simply slide the tiles around the playing field using both vertical and horizontal strokes, using the combination of the two to get the colored tiles underneath the same colored balls that mark the final position. Later challenges restrict how players can shift the tiles, either via gaps in the grid or specific tiles that are \"nailed down\" and cannot be moved. Early challenges are not nearly as bad as they'll get in the deeper levels, but it doesn't take long for the game to throw all sorts of variables, like a large assortment of colors, non-uniform layouts, or various special tiles, to ensure your head's going to hurt after just a few turns.   It's a glorified slide puzzle.   At the very least this is a game that's going to give you one hell of a run for your money. And if you're one of those rarities that actually love slide puzzle games, then man, this is the game for you.",

        "Content": "Editor's Note: In 2024, IGN published an updated Fallout 76 review to reflect its current state after years of improvements. After more than 50 hours plundering the irradiated wasteland of Fallout 76, the greatest mystery still lingering is who this mutated take on Fallout is intended for. Like many of Vault-Tec\u2019s underground bunkers, Bethesda\u2019s multiplayer riff on its post-nuclear RPG series is an experiment gone awry. There are bright spots entangled in this mass of frustratingly buggy and sometimes conflicting systems, but what fun I was able to salvage from the expansive but underpopulated West Virginia map was consistently overshadowed by the monotony of its gathering and crafting treadmill. On the surface, Fallout 76 is another dose of Bethesda\u2019s tried-and-true open-world RPG formula on a larger-than-ever map that\u2019s begging to be explored. As you emerge from Vault 76 you\u2019ll start in a relatively peaceful forest and venture out into more dangerous pockets of the irradiated wasteland. My favorite is traveling the lengths of the Cranberry Bog, where the pinkish-red fields are seemingly inviting from afar but turn out to be full of a snaking system of trenches and alien forests that hide the worst horrors of the wasteland, but there are many more. But while the lighting and art direction of these different regions are great at setting the eerie mood and tone of a destroyed Appalachia, the actual objects like trees, shrubs, buildings, cars, and more somehow look flatter and less detailed than those in Fallout 4 did three years ago. Coupling that with Bethesda\u2019s still-unimpressive character animations, Fallout 76 isn\u2019t a good-looking game except when viewed from the exact right angles. Fallout 76 isn\u2019t a good-looking game except when viewed from the exact right angles.When you look closer, it becomes obvious that Bethesda\u2019s ambitious idea to replace all human NPCs with other players results in a lack of meaningful interaction with the world. Other than 20-something other players spread so thinly over a massive map that chance encounters are rare outside of quest locations, just about the only voices you\u2019ll hear are recordings of long-dead questgivers, robots, and AI constructs who simply deliver information at you. Where past Fallout games have more than made up for some of their frustrations with brow-furrowing questions like whether to destroy the town of Megaton or what should become of the New Vegas Strip, there\u2019s no opportunity for the morally tricky decision-making in Fallout 76 because no one talking to you can hear you. Because of that, the so-called main story quests to track down and eliminate the source of a spreading plague boil down to obediently following a breadcrumb trail of journals and notes. With the exception of some occasional goofy and creative tasks, it all feels like chasing ghosts. And though later missions mask the shallowness with some cool large-scale battles and events, they\u2019re fleeting moments. Wandering the diverse wasteland does reveal one of Bethesda\u2019s great strengths: environmental storytelling.Wandering the diverse wasteland of Appalachia does reveal one of Bethesda\u2019s great strengths: environmental storytelling. Discovering a goofy teddy bear playing pots-and-pans drums in a shack in the middle of nowhere tells me someone was here for a time, and so very bored. A skeleton holding flowers, a bottle of wine, and a stuffed animal reveals that someone was about to take the plunge and profess their admiration when the world burst into flame. A half-sunken church with tunnels leading into a deeper, icicle light-adorned cavern has me wondering who reclaimed this place? Was it a sanctum? A place to hide from everything outside? All of these little moments and so many more are dotted across the landscape of West Virginia, and though they\u2019re such small things, they speak volumes about the diverse variety of lives that were led before the bombs fell and in the times shortly thereafter. But really, it just made me want to meet some of them. label=Wasteland%20Infestation By now this shouldn\u2019t be news to anyone, but: a new Fallout game has bugs. Yet even by the notorious standards of a Bethesda open-world game, Fallout 76 is technically shaky, and unlike the radiation-soaked radroaches and bloatflys you encounter these annoying bugs can\u2019t be resolved by incinerating them with a laser pistol. Technical problems occupy the spectrum of severity. Some can be endearing: I\u2019ve casually shot the head off a feral ghoul, sending both parts cartwheeling into the air at hilarious speed, and watched a hulking crustacean get caught in a small patch of trees, unable to free itself from what, to it, should\u2019ve been a tiny weed. That\u2019s not ideal, but in dour moments they can add an absurdist sense of humor to the otherwise-dreary wasteland environment. I\u2019ve had quest targets already dead upon arrival, forcing me to jump from server to server until I found one where it was still alive.I\u2019m far less amused, however, by the hive of deeply frustrating bugs that\u2019s infested virtually all of Fallout 76\u2019s systems. There are noticeable framerate dips and freezes for several seconds at a time that sometimes recover and sometimes crash the application, and these are as common as the rising and setting sun.There are quests that can\u2019t be completed \u2013 some of which were addressed with a ridiculously large post-launch patch, but others have not \u2013 and I\u2019ve had quest targets already dead upon arrival, forcing me to jump from server to server (not easy to do because there\u2019s no server browser \u2013 you\u2019re automatically assigned one on every login) until I found one where it was still alive. I\u2019m looking at you, Evan. I\u2019ve seen whole sections of my camp suddenly disappear, or load in 30 seconds after I\u2019d fast-traveled to it, or duplicate all the materials for no reason, forcing me to delete the entire blueprint and rebuild piece by piece. I\u2019ve been stuck on never-ending loading screens. I\u2019ve watched wasteland cows glitch 30 feet into the air, and back down, over and over. I\u2019ve stared in disbelief as power armor turned player characters into long-appendaged vaguely humanoid monsters (Okay, maybe that one should be in the funny category) or cause players to go invisible. One of my cohorts\u2019 characters became stuck for a full day and couldn\u2019t play at all. The list goes on and on and on. But despite their frequency and severity, most are corrected when you quit the application and relaunch - but because you can\u2019t declare one server your home and find it again on demand, that means any server-specific things you do, like taking over workshop camps and building resource generators, are left behind and become casualties of Fallout 76\u2019s rampant issues. Bethesda\u2019s open-world games have always had a touch of random instability, but at least everything was usually as we left it when we restarted and came back. I imagine the fact that Fallout 76 is an online game has ratcheted all the usual problems up quite a bit. label=Mr.%20Oppenheimer's%20Neighborhood What I appreciated most about playing with friends is the companionship and levity they add to this lonely world.On paper, encountering a stranger controlled by another human in the dog-eat-dogmeat world of Fallout sounds like a dangerous thrill. But instead of playing up the kind of uneasy alliances and backstabbing we\u2019ve seen in other survival games and battles royale, in Fallout 76 you\u2019re almost prohibited from engaging in anything resembling player-versus-player aggression. You can\u2019t do any significant damage until both people have attacked each other, so there\u2019s no element of surprise and no sense of danger. It\u2019s the most kid-gloves version of competitive multiplayer I\u2019ve ever seen. And even if you do kill someone, or even just pick the lock on their camp, there\u2019s virtually nothing to be gained but a price on your head and a bright red marker on the map inviting everyone to take a shot at you. Instead, Fallout 76 is more of a cooperative PvE game, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s at its best since the solo experience is desperately lonely and you have to find everything yourself, rather than have your friends divide and conquer by building their gear into different styles and share finds they don\u2019t need or want. Loot is individual to each player, so everybody gets to loot the same corpses \u2013 hence, the more players you have, the greater the payoff for each kill. The mechanical benefit of grouping brings the ability to freely fast-travel to one other, use teammates\u2019 custom-built camps, and of course the added firepower your friends and their guns bring certainly helps later on when you\u2019re fighting two, or three Skyrim dragon-like scorchbeasts at once, or any of the other more deadly dangers in the wasteland. But what I appreciated most about playing with friends is the companionship and levity they add to this lonely world. You can also share a subset of cards in the flexible new Perk system. Fallout has always allowed us to customize our characters by picking every so often from a handful of gameplay-altering modifiers, such as making certain items weigh less, doing more damage while sneaking, or even more creative bonuses like Cannibal, which allows you to regain health by eating the flesh of humanoids. Fallout 76\u2019s take on this system is actually pretty clever - everybody gets packs containing random perk cards which can be assigned to your SPECIAL (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) slots. Mechanically, Fallout 76\u2019s combat falls somewhere between floaty and just fine.But there are some frustrating UI elements that come with grouping, alongside a barebones friends list menu. Additionally, I found it frustrating that members of the team don\u2019t get experience for a kill unless they tag it before it dies. I understand this is likely to prevent power leveling, but the difference between hiding behind a rock while a higher level teammate does all the work, and hiding behind a rock and shooting an enemy with a single bullet in the same scenario is the smallest of differences. More often than not, it meant our team was more focused on making sure everyone shot every target at least once before it was killed, rather than enjoying the fight. Mechanically, Fallout 76\u2019s combat falls somewhere between floaty and just fine. I leaned into rifles at long range and shotguns or melee swipes up close - but always in first-person, because hitting anything up close in third-person is hit-or-miss. With only a watered-down real-time version of Fallout\u2019s signature VATS auto-targeting available, which is really only useful for spotting enemies at a distance or taking out obnoxiously small targets, every little bit helps against the inventive and varied enemies. The recognizable insects, ghouls, robots, super mutants, and not-so-super mutant animals are all here, alongside some strange, creepy, and downright bizarre creatures that reside in the fringes of West Virginia\u2019s distinct and atmospheric biomes. Even after 50 hours, I\u2019m still occasionally coming across a new variety of man-eating monstrosity, and that\u2019s one of the few things left to look forward to. Unfortunately, poor AI and pathing means most of these monsters \u2013 even the mightiest beasts \u2013 can be killed in the cheesiest ways you can imagine. That takes some of the sense of achievement out of it. One of Fallout 76\u2019s brightest ideas, though, is your portable camp which can be built up and dropped almost anywhere in the world that isn\u2019t too close to an existing structure. That\u2019s a big improvement over Fallout 4, which limited you to building on specified plots. I\u2019m still coming across new varieties of man-eating monstrosities, and that\u2019s one of the few things left to look forward to.In your camp you\u2019re given a budget of items allowed to build, basically, whatever you want. A three-story mega structure? Go for it. A platform with no walls, just a stash box and workbench? That\u2019ll work in a pinch. A house complete with chairs, beds, lights, a Nuka Cola machine, and even some motel-esque artwork? Do it. That\u2019s a largely cosmetic choice for people who enjoy building for the sake of building, but the camp system is most powerful when used a mobile repair and resource shop, using the limited budget to build a weapons, armor, tinkerer, and chemical crafting stations, along with resource-generating machines so you can return and collect materials for future crafting. The fact my camp was mobile meant I could deploy it in the middle of a high-level warzone and find relative respite and to repair when fights against more difficult monsters wore me down. However, because there\u2019s no real PvP, there\u2019s little need to fortify it with buildable auto-turrets other than to lure enemies to yet another cheap-feeling death. While the defense options are impressive, like no-nonsense artillery cannons, going that extra mile is expensive and I found the budget was consistently better spent on maintenance and resource options. And like just about everything else in Fallout 76, this system suffers from a number of bugs that makes moving camp a huge hassle. Sure, you can save your blueprint, or store a completed structure for quick deployment later, but the placement system is so finicky that something as small as a rock or tree intersecting with a single part of your base means you can\u2019t set it down. Ultimately, I was able to pick up shop and drop it down somewhere else, but the majority of attempts I would spend too long trying to find the perfect spot without success, so I would regularly need to scrap the structure and lay each piece down individually. label=The%20Cost%20of%20Creation Tracking down the plans to create new gear is one of the best-feeling measures of progression.When you\u2019re not running quests you\u2019re scrounging for pretty much anything that\u2019s not nailed down, scrapping those items for materials, and crafting better stuff. Tracking down the plans to create new gear, or pieces for your camp, or even recipes for better food or stimulants is one of the best-feeling measures of progression. Largely because once you own it, it\u2019s yours. You\u2019ll never need to worry about using it, or losing it, or repairing it, and when I was able to craft a power fist that exponentially improved over my other melee weapons after tracking it down and spending hundreds of caps on the plan, I had a genuine sense of pride. And there are a wealth of weapons, armors, and items to collect, assemble, and mod. In the beginning you\u2019ll be taping a pipe to a trigger and using it as something resembling a gun. Or boiling smelly leather for makeshift scraps of armor. They\u2019re entry level, sure, but they're the best you can make and that makes them valuable if only for a short time. Toward the late game, the emphasis swings almost entirely from exploration and discovery to resource and inventory management.Eventually you\u2019ll find pre-made weapons, and then the focus becomes scrapping enough desk fans for screws, wonderglue and duct tape for adhesive, and cans and canisters for aluminum to make mods like scopes, better receivers, stocks, and more. Augmenting your found or crafted gear into more formidable implements. There\u2019s a genuine satisfaction to creating something from scraps, but the constant hunt for household items to breakdown for materials to feed your ever-growing arsenal is a monkey you\u2019ll never get off your back. In fact, toward the late game, the emphasis swings almost entirely from exploration and discovery to resource and inventory management support your repeated attempts at endgame scenarios. That\u2019s when you\u2019re required to build, maintain, and carry your entire arsenal of power armor, a hefty selection of weapons, and ample ammo alongside the food, water, and chemical stimulants that you have to regularly pop to render the light survival elements (consisting entirely of a food meter and a water meter) all but completely irrelevant. All of this weight easily bogs you down, and your personal stash box in your camp has an absurdly tiny 400-pound limit. Remember, this isn\u2019t a traditional Fallout game where you could drop 15 gatling laser cannons into a single desk drawer and expect them to be there when you return 15 hours later \u2013 Fallout 76 barely has a sense of object permanence. So by the time I reached late-game levels I was spending at least five minutes of every hour I played just managing and sacrificing inventory to avoid the severe mobility consequences of becoming over-encumbered. That got old quickly. label=The%20Nuclear%20Option But by this point \u2013 the late level 40s \u2013 I\u2019d become bored with the monotony of Fallout 76\u2019s endless loop. Yet finally, after dozens of hours grinding missions, searching for launch codes, solving a cypher, my team of weary survivors approached the ultimate goal for one last thrill: we invaded a pre-war silo and fought off wave after wave of the same super-powered robots for the privilege of launching a nuclear weapon somewhere on the map. By this point I\u2019d become bored with the monotony of Fallout 76\u2019s endless loop.Though going through the many steps seems needlessly convoluted \u2013 traveling all across the map to find a number of codes with an expiration date, along with specially marked key cards, that then needed to be deciphered with a cypher that left plenty of room for error and the possibility of losing all these materials without ever getting a chance to complete the objective. Fortunately we figured it out, and fought more robots, and more robots, and then once we started the sequence, we fought even more robots. But I must admit: the seconds just before and just after the warhead fell to Earth were the highest of highs Fallout 76 had offered me. The explosion was spectacular from my planned vantage point. And that\u2019s when I knew I was done with Fallout 76.Yet when we ventured to the impact site, now glowing bright orange, in search of high-level goodies, what we found was deeply discouraging. Even the power of a nuclear explosion couldn\u2019t shake up the Fallout 76 gameplay beyond nudging the number of hitpoints the bullet-sponge enemies possessed even higher, which meant it boiled down to fighting stronger versions of the same enemies we\u2019d already killed hundreds of times. The reward: rare plants and resources that would allow us to\u2026 craft more powerful weapons and armor to\u2026 I guess, do it all over again, except more easily. Was the slog worth it? Not really, no. And that\u2019s when I knew I was done with Fallout 76. Finally, the fact that there\u2019s a cash shop with obscenely expensive cosmetic items \u2013 like power armor skins that cost somewhere around $15 USD if you haven\u2019t acquired enough of the secondary currency yet. That Fallout 76 is in need of so much other attention, but you\u2019re still able to spend money on cosmetics from the storefront adds some insult to the overall injury."

        "Content": "Signing up for an MMO encompasses more than your standard purchase. You're buying into a social network to meet other players and maybe make a few new friends. To some it's an escape, an alternative lifestyle, a toy, an ego machine, and to all it's a game. Simply providing a vast online fantasy world to run around in with others isn't enough these days. While Final Fantasy XIV features a flexible class system and interesting crafting mechanics, issues with its presentation, performance, and core questing structure turn what could be an entertaining online adventure into an arduous experience that, in its current state, isn't worth playing.  If you're familiar with Final Fantasy XI, Square Enix's previous MMO in its flagship RPG line, you'll know the game was never very easy to get into. While Final Fantasy XIV is certainly more solo-friendly for players who prefer to quest and level on their own, it's disappointingly unfriendly toward those trying figure out all the various rules and systems churning beneath the surface that govern life, advancement, and success in its setting of Eorzea. If you've never played an MMO before, this is most definitely not the place to start. Even genre veterans are going to need to spend a good deal of time scanning fan sites and databases to understand how everything works, even for basic information on necessary functions like performing item repairs.    Things do start out in a directed fashion, though. At the beginning you're given a chance to create and name your character. A number of races, from the hulking Roegadyn to the cat-like Miqo'te, can be chosen and customized in a few different ways. As tends to be standard in the genre you'll also be asked to pick a class, though the choice isn't especially meaningful. In Final Fantasy XIV you're never locked into one particular class, so the one chosen at the start only defines your character for as long as it takes to get to an item shop.  Before stepping onto the game's various progression treadmills you'll be dumped into a sequence of cut-scenes filled with character dialogue, combat, and exploration around whichever city you chose to start in. These story-driven scenes are some of the best parts of the game as it stands right now, helping to tell the tale of the world, showing you around the land, and foreshadowing events to come. More story missions become available at later progression milestones and eventually unlock other extras, but are so spaced out that feel more like bandages to remedy a general lack of narrative context throughout. It's rare to ever feel as though you're questing for a reason outside of bumping up your class rank.  For braving the dangers that lie outside of the walls of each major starting city in Eorzea you'll have a number of combat options. Magic users will want to take up arms as a Conjurer or Thaumaturge, while those who prefer to hit enemies with heavy things will want to pick the axe-wielding Marauder or the Gladiator who attacks and defends with a sword and shield. The variety of combat classes means players should be able to find a mold in which they feel comfortable, but the nice part is you'll never feel too limited.  By simply purchasing and equipping a class' weapon type, you become that class. If you're tired of slogging through fight after fight as a Lancer, for instance, you can just equip a bow and all of a sudden you're an Archer. The trick to effective play is unlocking skills in various classes to customize your ideal build. For example, you could level up a Pugilist and a Conjurer to unlock heal abilities, then switch to a Marauder and equip the helpful skills to make you more durable in solo combat. That Square Enix grants this kind of freedom to players is great to see, and it's fun to experiment with all the different styles of play to see what you like best, or simply having the option to quickly swap classes should the needs of a group require a new tank, healer, or ranged damage dealer.   The overall game world is enormous.  The crafting and gathering systems built into the game also contribute to the class system. If you equip a mining pick, you can then hack at deposits for ore and other valuables. Then if you equip other specialty equipment you'll don the hat of a wide range of production classes, from those that build heavy armor to those that tinker with rings and jewelry. These crafting and gathering systems aren't merely side activities, but heavily integrated into the rhythms of life in Eorzea. Success in crafting and harvesting quests yields points that not only rank up the class, but also contribute to a universal pool of experience called physical level. So while each class is leveled on an individual basis only while the corresponding tool or weapon is equipped, you'll always be earning experience for the physical level. When increased, it frees up points to be assigned to things like attack, defense and accuracy, as well as a variety of magical properties, which gives a solid sense of a growing overall power even while you're not swinging weapons out on the battlefield.  Aside from that, crafting is especially important in the game since it's the primary method of getting better gear. The occasional item can be earned by completing quests, but in general if you want better gear you're going to have to build it, buy it directly from a crafter, or find it on the open market. Like many of the game's functions, little is explained about the actual crafting process. Once learned you'll find it's a high risk system that infuses a significant degree of chance into the creation process as you juggle a variety of percentage sliders and an abstract color-coding system. Failure is a frequent part of this process, but that makes successful production all the more satisfying.  Because of the way the class system is set up you could, theoretically, be a master of all crafts, though realistically I would assume people only have time to focus on one or two things. There's plenty of social interaction built into the creation system, as some classes can only build components that others fashion into a whole, and getting different items repaired requires assistance by specific crafters. The problem since launch has been one of dissemination. It's always possible to spam chat channels with requests for armor or advertisements for personal stock to trade with others, but the heart of Final Fantasy XIV's economy is the market system, which right now is a mess.   Square Enix has said that updates are on the way for improving the markets, but even with some aid it's only one of many examples of a system that wasn't adequately developed prior to launch. As of this review's publish time the system requires you to hire a retainer, an NPC that can be given items and set in an instanced market area. The idea is that other players will enter into this area, find your retainer, and then purchase items you put up for sale. Yet in practice it means there's a disorganized mess of NPC retainers standing around market areas with little indication of what's being sold. If you want to buy a new sword, you have to visit one by one every retainer in sight until you just happen to by chance come across one in stock. It's a grossly inefficient process, and perplexing that it ever made it into the launch version of the game. For a game with such a heavy emphasis on crafted items, it's unfortunate Square Enix felt it was acceptable to implement such a fragmented distribution framework.  Once you're through with crafting, selling and buying, it's out into the field to you to go participate in the game's quests. These are referred to as levequests of which only a limited quantity are available at a time. In the downtime until more quests unlock, the idea is to get you to interact with others to latch onto their quests, again serving as a method of strengthening the social fabric of the game. Initiating a quest requires you travel out to camps scattered around the landscapes outside of cities. In each sits a giant crystal called an Aetheryte where quests are initiated, and you're then put on a timer until the objectives are achieved and the task completed. Initially it'll be a fun adventure as you burn through tasks and quickly rank up, but with continued play the levequests lose their appeal.   If you start in Ul'dah, this is part of the starting story.  When it comes to MMOs, what really separates the best from the rest are the ways they keep the entertainment value high over long tracts of time. In the case of levequesting, you're given kill and collection quotas with an extremely thin veneer of story. It won't be long until each quest starts to feel exactly the same. The ways Square Enix attempts to infuse variety \u2013 targets fleeing for reinforcements, targets changing form \u2013 fall flat. For the first few levels it isn't particularly noticeable since the process of ranking up your class happens fairly quickly. However, once you reach higher levels and realize there are only a handful of quests you'll need to churn through for hours and hours before becoming powerful enough to reach the next camp and quest set, it's difficult to stay motivated. The game does far too little to mask the fact that it's tossed you on a gerbil wheel.  If you can deal with jumping through the same hoops time and time again, there's at least a difficulty system associated with quests. With a larger group it's best to set the quest for a higher degree of challenge with the notion of potentially earning more skill points for your class. A few other activities exist as well, though their overall effect isn't significant. There's an hourly behest quest that can be taken on, which is essentially a larger-scale version of the levequests. Dungeons lie all over the land, faction quests open up once enough favor is gained, and of course there's always the option to grind solo or in groups, which is as mind-meltingly dull as it's ever been.   One of the many steps to crafting. Thankfully the actual combat is fun to play around with. Since you'll be collecting skills from each class as well as focusing on whichever you prefer, group members can have a diverse range of abilities regardless of class designation. The game also limits the amount of abilities that can be active at one time, meaning you can't just equip everything at once, but must determine which skills work best together. During the slow-paced combat you'll find all the familiar roles \u2013 tanks, healers, ranged damage dealers, and those better suited for defeating single and multiple targets. How this system develops over the course of Final Fantasy XIV's life cycle will be interesting to watch, especially aspects like the battle regimen mechanic whereby group members can queue up attacks and then unload on enemies to trigger special effects. Unfortunately a variety of elements, from targeting to input precision, are affected by the game's poorly designed interface and performance issues.  Considering how frequently you need to interact with the interface in combat and while buying and selling, it's surprising Square Enix decided to build in something so inelegant. For some reason it's required that you open a main menu tab to access any of the critical menus like ability customization menus, gear layout, and quest journals, and there are way too many submenus that must be opened in order to get the simplest of tasks accomplished. In individual cases these don't seem like much but over the span of weeks and months of play it adds up to a dizzying amount of time wasted on navigating the cumbersome menus.  Other mystifying inconveniences include burying your gear's durability status, a near useless overworld map, and making selling items to vendors or exchanging with your retainer an unnecessarily painful process, making you wonder what the developers were thinking when coming up with this. It could be that it'll be the same interface that's eventually put into the PlayStation 3 version, but for PC players it's a perpetual hindrance. Hopefully in the time post-launch Square Enix will take steps to work on this and make character management less of a chore to handle.   Yet the issues don't end there. A big focus over the coming months will hopefully be with regards to performance optimization. Even on a near top of the line machine the game chugs consistently. If you've got a less powerful machine and turn down the settings, it's unfortunately still a stuttery experience. It's not unplayable, but in outdoor locations especially around Limsa Lominsa, it's something that can't be ignored and that frequently intrudes on the combat and joy of exploration.  The saddest part is that the game, performance problems aside, is one of the prettiest MMOs I've ever seen. The sandy mesa and rock formations around the dusty stretches of Ul'dah are incredibly detailed, especially as you expand the reach of your travels and discover vast valleys and stunning landscape variation. The tall trees clouding the skies around Gridania aren't quite as impressive when compared against the vast grassy terrain and outcroppings of white rock around Limsa Lominsa, but it's all consistently impressive, especially when you're able to observe the lighting during a sunset along the rim of the world over the silhouette of a sprawling fantastical city.  Armor and weapons designs are equally well detailed, making them all the more alluring beyond the obvious statistical benefits. Animations are smooth and realistic, with characters and enemy types moving about with a sense of weight that helps infuse Eorzea with a degree of realism as you hack away at dodos, marmots, wolves, and more fearsome creatures at higher levels. The soundtracks is also a standout feature, with music that sounds distinctly at home in a Final Fantasy game playing and shifting throughout, and the occasional smattering of voice acting during story missions.   What a tease.  It's important to note that as of right now this is a game built for player versus environment content, so steer clear if you're into competitive player versus player combat. If you're someone who likes to sprint to the highest levels as fast as possible, Square Enix has built in limits. Resources that can be drawn on to fast traveling between camps and cities and special bonuses during quests can be depleted and regenerate slowly, meaning it's best to only play for a few hours per session which, quite honestly, is reasonable.  What's odd is that these mechanisms seems to be built to cater to a more casual crowd, though the game is clearly built for a hardcore player with plenty of time to spend. Keep in mind getting anything done of significance in Final Fantasy XIV even at low levels can take an extremely long amount of time, in part because the game is designed to be played at a relaxed pace, but also because you're forced to waste so much time fidgeting with the interface and dealing with lag and performance annoyances. And if after reading all this you're still interested in the game, head over to our review journal for more detail on how everything works ."

        "Content": "As the gaming industry has matured (well, let's just say \"aged\"), more than a few of the PC catalog's genres have fallen by the wayside. Puzzle games, flight simulators, space combat games, and economic trading games have all become sad casualties to the hit-driven mentality that encourages lots of game publishers to pop out clone after clone of the latest FPS, RTS, or MMO. So it's gratifying that independent developers Hermitworks Entertainment Corporation have decided to revive the classic economic trading game with Space Trader: Merchant Marine . The game itself is a throwback in more ways than one. Not only does it offer up a type of game that we rarely see anymore, but its presentation values and overall design philosophy reach back to the mid-1990s and some of the games we were playing back then. While there's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, it does make Space Trader feel a bit like an antique or relic of an earlier generation of gaming. Those gamers who are more accustomed to more modern games may find themselves either amused or aggravated by some of Space Trader's features. Even those gamers who find the outdated approach charming will likely be put off by the thin narrative and repetitive gameplay.  The graphics, like the game design, are a throwback. Things begin predictably enough. You've just acquired a trading license and are seeking a wealthy benefactor who will provide you with a ship to launch your trading career. At first, you'll be restricted to running goods back and forth between Earth and the moon, but once you've proven you can make a profit (and paid off your initial loan), the solar system will begin to open up. You'll soon be running a wide range of commodities among a large network of traders located on different planets. The catch is that there's a time limit for each of the campaign's five chapters, so if you can't accomplish the goals within that time, then you'll have to restart the whole chapter. This is particularly obnoxious because you can't manually save your progress. Any missteps or delays you encounter along the way become a permanent part of your balance sheet. Thankfully, the game is saved every time you exit, so you don't have to complete a chapter in a single sitting. The good news is that it's almost impossible to lose money. Each trader not only lists their price for a given item, but they also show you that item's average price so you know whether you're getting a good deal or not. Certain news reports and missions will even clue you in to unique opportunities, so you'll know, for instance, when to start running platinum to a planet that's having a raw material shortage or guns to planet that's experiencing a crime wave. There are even a few missions where you can get involved in creating crises that will drive prices of certain goods up or down.  You can take advantage of random events to boost your profits. The game makes some distinction between legal and illegal goods, but it amounts to nothing. You can freely trade legal goods with legal merchants and then turn right around and sell the contraband to the black market. And since you can jump from trader to trader without even having to walk, selling legal and illegal goods has no moral distinction whatsoever. The campaign itself includes some small story elements, but there's really not enough to keep you going. Yes, there's the twist in your relationship with your initial benefactor and, yes, there's some intriguing complications with the Ministry of Accounts, but the story is fairly thin and really only serves to give the most tenuous context to the planet-hopping trading. While that's bad enough, it's made even worse by the resets that occur between the chapters. We've inexplicably lost millions of dollars and dozen of cargo slots this way with no real explanation. The trading game is broken up with a number of 1990s-style shooter missions. Some of these are part of the progression of the main campaign story, and others are mere side quests that you can undertake to gain extra cash and cargo. In any case, they look, feel and play remarkably like the first generation versions of Unreal or Doom. There are glowing shield picks ups, puffs of blood and plenty of enemies that literally appear out of nowhere. While it makes a nice diversion from the trading, the shooter aspect of the game isn't really strong enough to stand on its own. You'll begin to see a lot of repetition in the levels. It seems that everyone, from space gangsters to ministry officials, make their hideout either in a large, dark spaceship or a graffiti-laced subway station. The levels are laid out exactly the same in each case, which makes it a little boring to run through after about the 12th time. While we like the designs overall, the constant repetition makes it far too hard to ignore the flat textures and low-poly assets. There are other continuity problems as well. First, it would be nice if you, with your $60,000,000 bank account and cargo hold full of contraband weapons, could start one of these missions with more than a crappy pistol. It's easy enough to grab the weapons you need (particularly since they're always in the same places on each level), but it suggests a break in the reality of the game world. This hairline crack in your suspension of disbelief becomes a veritable chasm when you realize you're given three lives in each mission. As long as you don't die that third time, you're golden.  I've grown to hate this subway level. To be fair, there are some interesting surprises in some of the missions. In some cases, you may be able to reach a peaceful compromise with your target, either through debate , subterfuge, or through bribery. Where those options are possible, you'll be given a clear heads up, and multiple opportunities to gather the information or items you need before coming to blows. We've already mentioned the monotonous shooter levels and the ways that the repetitive nature of the content highlights the shortcomings of the graphics engine. Textures are relatively flat, the same handful of character models are used again and again, and there's very little sense of life or animation in the world at all. Some of the art elements do show a spark of creativity, but the very fact that many of the enemies are referred to as \"goons\" are indicative of a general lack of invention across the board. What little voice acting there is isn't terribly impressive but it still manages to add some spark of life to the game. Unfortunately, whatever soul is added by the voice work is drowned out by a rather dismal techno soundtrack.  Spotting the good deals is very easy. "

        "Title": "Animal Boxing Review",
        "Content": "This week the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) caused a stir with a Flash game that serves as a complaint about the popular Cooking Mama games.  The organization is apparently hurt that Mama hasn't produced an all-vegetarian edition of her casual cooking series.  Let's hope PETA doesn't catch wind of Animal Boxing , a game that consists entirely of a human beating the snot out of critters.  While it's an original concept that looks great and literally turns the DS on its head, the tap dance gameplay gets old fast.  You play as a human who, for whatever reason, has decided to live in a village of anthropomorphic animals.  Things are peaceful until a boxing gym is erected and everyone's animal instincts kick in.  You'll need to assert your position at the top of the food chain by punching every rooster, gecko, and panther in town.   These animals need to be reminded of their place. Jabs, hooks, and uppercuts are all performed by tapping and drawing on the touch screen.  The most unique aspect of Animal Boxing is that it requires the player to turn their DS upside down so that the touch screen is on top.  To jab, you tap on your opponent's face or stomach.  A hook is produced by drawing a line from the side of their head onto their face.  An uppercut is done by drawing a line up through their body.  The buttons or D-pad (depending on which hand you use) are for blocking and dodging, but most animals can be defeated by frantically tapping all over the touch pad.  I mean, we are the superior beings, after all.  The bouts tend to drag on a little long in Animal Boxing, partly because you can't KO your opponent.  You have to get a TKO (technical knockout) and put them down three times.  Failing that, the boxer who landed the most punches when time runs out is the victor.  Adding to the sluggish feeling of the game are long load times in between matches.  Developer Gammick produces great artwork (see the recent Zombie BBQ), and the character designs and animation are great here.  Each animal is differentiated from one another and has its own liveliness.  There are 50 creatures waiting to be unlocked.  They aren't as individual as Punch-Out!, though, so all of that fun of studying their behavior and learning their secrets is missing.  The music is pretty forgettable, there aren't any crowd noises, and every animal makes the same sounds.",

The idol-making simulation features cute anime-girl personifications of modern gaming consoles, but its ham-fisted attempt at fanservice and shallow gameplay corrupt that premise and turn what could have been fun and lighthearted into a dull, pointless venture not worth thinking twice about. Neptunia starts off with a promising and cheeky idea: Four goddess-like Console Patron Units, or CPUs, rule the realm of Gamindustri, each representing a major gaming console (one of which is fictitious). A suspicious idol group called MOB48 \u2014 a play on real-life J-pop group AKB48 \u2014 has usurped the CPUs and taken the \u201cshares\u201d of the Gamindustri people\u2019s love. More shares means more power, so the girls decide to become idols themselves to win back the hearts of the people. The key, of course, is you: an average student getting ready for a summer gaming marathon. Everything goes downhill plotwise when you \u2014 immediately assumed to be a straight male \u2014 arrives in Gamindustri and meets the CPUs. When I (playing as a character I dubbed \u201cDude\u201d) chose the Xbox personification Vert as my idol, much of the conversation focused on her figure. \u201cMy soft chest acted as your landing pillow, I see,\u201d was her response when Dude apparently fell from the sky and landed on her; she later introduced herself formally as \u201cthe one who possesses the most voluptuous breasts in all of Gamindustri.\u201d It\u2019s cool that she\u2019s proud of that and stuff, but it was definitely a little off-putting that she went straight to that. I mean, the conspicuous and incredibly unrealistic jiggle physics made her voluptuousness absolutely clear from the get-go. Dude wasn\u2019t complaining about becoming her producer, however that job isn\u2019t all that exciting if you\u2019re over the whole boobs thing. Day-to-day Producer Mode simulation activities come in a few varieties: \u201cwork,\u201d which increases your fanbase, \u201clesson,\u201d which ups your stats, \u201crelax,\u201d which reduces stress, \u201cmove,\u201d in which you travel to one of the four Gamindustri nations, and \u201cconcert,\u201d which I\u2019ll get to in a second. The \u201cstrategy\u201d here is to keep stress low in order to increase gains from working or learning and to have the majority of the shares before 180 days have passed, and it took me maybe three hours and 80 game days to get there without really trying. As advertized, it requires almost no thought. Concerts are the most active part of Neptunia, but they actually require very little effort and become really tedious. Your only task as producer is to set the stage, pick outfits and accessories for the idols, and move the camera around. I got far more points when I just changed the camera angles wildly rather than trying to be more realistic or artistic, and after a few concerts I basically button-mashed my way to idol status. Choosing the CPUs\u2019 outfits before the shows was fun, but that didn\u2019t have an effect on my performance and seemed like it was meant to titillate. I bet you do. The only thing keeping me from zoning out entirely during Producer Mode was the dialogue, which can be cute and funny. There are a lot of gaming references \u2014 for example, Blanc, the Nintendo personification, describes her nation Lowee as a place that everyone in the family can enjoy, while Sony-based Noire brags about her superior hardware. Additionally, the CPUs have younger sisters that represent the handheld versions of their respective consoles, and they\u2019re adorable when you get to talk to them. My favorites were Ram and Rom, Blanc\u2019s sisters, who represent the two screens of a DS and are a little feisty. Unfortunately, even the dialogue is bogged down by casual sexist language and a distinct male gaze perspective. Whether it\u2019s \u201cVert\u2019s rack\u201d or Dude thinking a group of CPUs should be called an \u201cidol harem,\u201d it takes away from what could be cute and lighthearted. Fanservice on its own isn\u2019t really an issue, but fanservice in Neptunia completely drives the plot \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really make sense that a group of goddesses would need the help of a \u201ccut-and-paste stereotype,\u201d in CPU Neptune\u2019s words, who is only sticking around because they\u2019re hot. They turn into objects rather than real characters. Not only is it objectifying, it\u2019s condescending. I don't think you can produce your way out of this. Neptunia isn\u2019t too bad, however, until you open Viewer Mode. It pulls up a full-body model of the CPU of your choosing, who you can then touch in different places to provoke a response. The rear touch pad is used to, well, touch her rear, which might make her jump; touching her elsewhere will get you an enthusiastic \u201cHai!\u201d or a coquettish block. You can also set one of the CPUs to be your alarm clock, a strange and seemingly random feature. If Viewer Mode is your thing, then go for it, but I found their responses to be pretty creepy."

        "Content": "Inexplicably, My Aquarium was a hit. The five-dollar virtual sea life application shipped into the Wii Shop a summer ago, and despite offering almost no gameplay at all it's still somehow enjoyed consistent sales success since -- Nintendo's \"Most Popular\" list of the Top 20 selling WiiWare games has included it in prominent positions for over a year now, and it's frequently climbed as high as the Top 5. Why? Who knows. People must really love turning their TVs into fake fishtanks.   My Zoo , then, is Hudson's new attempt to repeat that same success. This game is, again, not much of a game at all -- it's another incredibly casual experience that offers little more than an interactive, wildlife-filled screensaver for your television, just like My Aquarium. The difference is that fish are no longer the focus -- now it's large, land-dwelling, exotic animals like elephants, lions and hippos. Combined with a handful of new features and functionality, it seems like this would be a safe and simple follow-up that could be another winner with the casual crowd. This zoo, though, doesn't really deserve your visit.  The first problem is the lack of that core point of connection that made My Aquarium make sense -- people have real aquariums in their homes. It's a fairly common thing, and it's understandable that there would be an audience who might appreciate a virtual representation of one, so they could enjoy a bit of the same sense of relaxation and not have to worry about any actual goldfish going belly-up on them.   A little bit of a change from the little bitty fish.  My Zoo, though, doesn't have that same intristic connection. People never have windows into armadillo enclosures in their living rooms, it's not a common thing, and there's probably not much of an audience who've even thought about having a constant video of American black bears on loop while they kick back and play board games with the kids. My Zoo just doesn't have that immediate \"oh yeah, that makes sense\" impact that My Aquarium did.  Then it only gets worse from there. Without a hook as engaging as its predecessor, My Zoo would have to trump it in other ways to be considered a worthy successor -- but it doesn't. You can choose from eight different kinds of animals here, including elephants, lions, hippos, armadillos, black bears, zebras, pandas and Malaysan tapirs. It seems a decent enough selection, except that My Aquarium had over three dozen different varieties of fish included.  And Hudson seems to recognize this deficiency from the start, too, as there are plans to release four more varieties of animal as DLC over the course of the next four months -- but not for free. You'll have to pay a dollar apiece for the right to raise giraffes, koalas, rhinos and cheetahs, meaning getting the full experience of this five-dollar budget-priced buy balloons the cost up to nine bucks instead.  The environments containing your animals are more limited than they were in My Aquarium, too -- in that game, you could custom-build your own virtual fishtank by positioning rocks, plants and other features around the screen in whichever way you wanted. Here, there are only four stock settings that can't be altered in any way, except that you can dim the lights in one of them. Thrilling.  And then there's the actual animal interaction, which is also terribly restricted. My Aquarium didn't do a lot with this, either -- but restricted interaction makes more sense with virtual fish. If you have an actual fishtank, you never do anything more than occasionally feed your pets anyway. Maybe you clean the tank on occasion, or tap on the glass to annoy everything swimming inside. But it's a naturally hands-off thing, most of the time.   One real-time hour equals one day in the game. Meaning the Hudson PR rep responsible for these screens has spent over two straight weeks, without sleep, staring at panda's butts.  Keeping zoo animals, on the other hand, is much more active, time-consuming and complicated -- but My Zoo treats it like it isn't. It offers only the option to feed, pet and call to your creatures. That's all. The rest of the experience is just watching them walk around as time passes by. It feels like you're being cheated out of real gameplay -- like My Zoo begins to evoke the feelings of a virtual pet kind of design, but then doesn't allow you to actually do anything with your pets.  My Zoo also cuts out the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection features that My Aquarium had -- so you're no longer able to share your work with friends.  You're left to experience it yourself, alone.  Finally, My Zoo does include some sense of reward for those crazy enough to invest multiple hours' worth of time investing in these do-nothing animals -- growth and reproduction. Spend enough time staring at the screen and occasionally clicking the feed icon and your animal will grow into adulthood -- then, it will have the chance to mate and give birth to a baby. That might offer some virtual zoo owners a sense of accomplishment, but all it will accomplish is starting the same cycle of tedium over again. I hope no one actually wastes enough of their life to pursue this goal, since if you want another baby animal to take care of all you have to do is go back to the main menu and choose the \"new animal\" option."

        "Content": "EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops.  ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover , but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.   Click here to watch the video review.  The end result, however, is a game that has practically zero redeeming qualities. It fails on almost every front and is a major step backwards not only for the franchise, but racing games in general. With Burnout Paradise having been out forever (and supported incredibly well by Criterion) and Midnight Club: Los Angeles having just shipped recently, the competition is very strong, leaving no reason whatsoever to choose Undercover over either of the aforementioned titles.  Part of the reason for this is the game's complete and utter misuse of its open world setting. The major reason for having an open world is to allow gamers to explore their environment, find new challenges, perhaps some hidden locations and generally hunt down people to race. That doesn't happen one bit in Undercover. You cannot even drive to an event to start it or enter your garage. To begin an event, you can either head to the overhead map, which requires a couple of seconds of loading despite its utter simplicity, or simply press down on the D-Pad. This will load up whatever your nearest event is, or in some cases, the next major event you're supposed to take part in.  All of this means that unless you're running from the cops, there's absolutely no reason to drive around the city when not in an event. You can't come across any hidden events, new racers or anything of this sort. Unless just feel like testing out your ride or just feel like exploring, there's no reason to drive around on your own.  The open world setting is also ignored in many of the game's events. When you take part in any standard race, the game closes off the streets so that you can only drive on the correct route. It's the game's way of putting you in a pre-defined track and not letting you veer from the beaten path. While transparent arrow walls would have been fine, this restricts not only you and your competition, but the traffic to the set race course as well. In other words, there's no cross traffic to deal with. How can you have an open world game and not have any cross traffic to contend with in races?   Click on the image to watch this video. Not all events are like this, but they don't get much better. One event type challenges you to get out in front of your competition and then stay ahead for a minute or so (or just pull away entirely). Once you're able to get ahead, it's an absolute piece of cake to dominate them, especially if you head to the highway since they'll likely crash into someone and leave you with such a gigantic lead that you can come to a complete stop, start again and still have plenty of breathing room.  This brings me to my next issue - the game is incredibly easy. It was fairly often that I'd win events by a good 20 seconds or so, and I'd have the worst car in the pack. In fact, I've been able to smoke a lineup of Lamborghinis and Corvettes with an Audi TT, and that should never happen. If your car's ratings are half of what your competition has, you can probably win with ease.   The game's upgrade and general car acquirement system also has its problems. Most of the cars are locked until you get to certain driver levels (which I'll come back to in a second), so you have to wait for them to become purchasable even if you have the cash. I'm not a fan of the system, but that's fine. The car upgrades work the same way however, and things are not unlocked in an order that makes sense. I've had low tier cars in my garage that I've only been able to purchase the first of three upgrade packages for, while I've also been able to buy significantly faster vehicles. Why would I ever upgrade the lesser cars at that point? Why wasn't I first allowed to fully upgrade them before earning the right to buy better cars? The whole order of things is very screwy.   Press down on the D-Pad to win the game. As for your own personal level, you'll earn driver points for winning races and performing stunts like drifts or near misses and so forth. Every time you either dominate a race (which means beating a set time in addition to winning) or gain a level, your driver abilities increase. Many of these stats don't make much sense to be assigned to a person. Things like a discount on parts make sense, but why would you have a Forced Induction rating on your person rather than your individual vehicles? Also, since you gain points when you dominate, that means racers who are already good (or even just competent given the very low difficulty level of the game) will just get better, while people who are struggling (which will be about three people) will only be able to rely on the new level upgrades to help them out.  It's worth noting that while the game retains the slick Autosculpt customization feature of the past couple titles, unlike last year, it doesn't have any effect on your performance. It's still cool to see it return, however, as it's a very cool customization feature unique to the franchise.  One of the bigger things hyped about the title since its first showing is the presentation and its live action cutscenes. By and large, these fail to do what was intended in a pretty big way. Most of the scenes feature one of two sequences - a bunch of jackasses in a back alley talking trash to the camera before or after a race, or Maggie Q sitting in a room and telling you what you should be doing next. The whole thing winds up being pretty laughable and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Maggie will tell you that you need to do to get on the inside of a racing group in order to get dirt on them, and then after a race she'll say  \"We have enough, let's move in.\" How did that help at all? They're going to just bust someone for street racing while they're tied to drug trafficking? You do run missions where you steal cars, make \"special\" deliveries and things like this now and again, but you never actually see any sequences that show how the cops are putting the evidence together or anything of that sort. It could have been so much better, but it falls very flat. It's also so overacted that you can't help but wonder if there was any sort of scene director on site because this is the stuff you see on the first day of acting school.   Click on the image to watch this video. While the gameplay is a big miss, the graphics don't help the case either. The game is very bland looking, with only reasonably detailed cars and a city that almost entirely lacks a sense of life. There are no pedestrians, there's very little traffic and on the whole there's very little to convince you that people actually live and work there.   While the Xbox 360 version runs at a mostly steady framerate, though certainly not a blistering one, the PlayStation 3 version can become downright unplayable at times. You'll see framerate hitches constantly from the start, but entering a race with a full lineup of fast cars who kick up dirt at the start can cause the game to crawl. You also clip into the back of vehicles when you hit them, and I've even seen a truck launch off the street and hover slowly to the side while spinning rapidly. After following it for a short bit, it changed directions and then shot at me at an incredible speed and knocked my vehicle in the air. We'll have to wait and see if the next issue of the National Enquirer runs my encounter as a UFO cover story.  There are also graphical issues with the game that extend beyond the framerate and overall visual style. Shadows are particularly peculiar. At some spots, they'll stay put, but at other times the angle of the shadows is directly tied to your current speed. If you stop moving, so will the shadows. If you move, either forwards or backwards, the shadows will start creeping across the city relative to your speed. In other words, if you move slow, they crawl, but if you're going fast they're blazing over the street and across objects. It looks very odd and out of place.   The sense of speed can be good, but that's about it. You'll also find lit polygons appear near the front of your car when they should be dark, especially when you drive through a tunnel, and it's most certainly not supposed to be your headlights. It's just another shoddy glitch that goes to show that the whole game lacks a feeling of any sort of refinement, both in terms of production and overall design.  The online component is competent, but very simplistic. You have three modes, which are really only two - Cops and Robbers, circuits races and dashes. The latter two are straight-up races, one of which has multiple laps and the other just having a separate start and finish line. Cops and Robbers is essentially a variant on one flag Capture the Flag where the robbers are trying to deliver the cash to their hideout while the cops are trying to bust them (which resets the cash). All of these work reasonably well and can be fun, but there's not much variety here, as you can tell.  The only two positives I can speak for about the game are its sense of speed and its great sound samples. When you get into a fast ride, like a McLaren F1 for example, you really get a sense of absolutely flying through the city. This part was at least done well. The sound samples for the cars (and tire screeches for that matter) are also quite awesome, though they're not mixed as well as could be. When you hit the gas the game sounds awesome, but letting your foot off the gas results in a dulled engine sound that's barely audible at times. So the sound is good overall, though it isn't perfect by any means.   Click on the image to watch this video. "

        "Title": "Bliss Island Review",
        "Content": "Let's get this out of the way straight off: There is nothing blissful about Bliss Island . It conjures no feelings of relaxation or nirvana. Neither does it have anything to do with Ms. Bliss from the early years of Saved by the Bell. The sad reality is that Bliss Island is a collection of mini-games that range from piss poor to being competitive with free internet flash games. Save your 400 Microsoft Points (US $5); this one isn't worth your time or money.  The single-player game takes you on an \"adventure\" through a series of seven mini-games broken into stages, complete with a text intro and some budget fireworks at the end of each of the three levels of difficulty. If you want, you can also tackle the games individually in a challenge mode. The hook that binds each mini-game together is the Zwooph, a mythical creature that shoots puffs of air to make clouds. Each game uses this air jet concept and some simple physics to create puzzles and basic platforming gameplay.    The mini-games are about as basic as you can get. In fact, you can find better alternatives to every one of them on the web for free. One involves directing balls of fruit into a creature's mouth. It's about as exciting as it sounds. Another is a simple race where slamming on the A button to boost continuously through gates is as deep as the game gets. There are two platforming levels, one a timed vertical climb and the other a top-down affair. The latter also has the added bonus of a ridiculously annoying camera, somehow.  The list is rounded out with a billiards game (knock like-colored balls into one another), a take on Space Invaders that involves boosting around to take out oncoming bricks of the same color and Cave Adventures. This last one is the most interesting, but it isn't much more than a more complex version of everyone's favorite helicopter flash game . If each mini-game were as interesting as Cave Adventures, there might be something worth looking at here. Instead, it's a single bright spot in an ill-conceived package.   Cave Adventure is the best of the bunch. In terms of fun, there's not much here and the presentation and graphics are on par with the gameplay. The artwork on the menus and loading screens is worse than Saturday morning cartoons from the 1980s and there's absolutely nothing done in the game that looks like it is taking advantage of the Xbox 360 hardware. The gameplay doesn't even run in true HD -- Bliss Island puts a border around the edges. It's just as well. The low-res textures would look even worse without the borders. The sound effects and music are as cookie-cutter as they come.  Bliss Island is ostensibly aimed at the casual market with its bright visuals and simple design, but even that target is missed thanks to aggravating levels of difficultly in the latter stages. There is a challenge here for those willing to take it. Playing through the adventure will probably take you four or five hours on the first try, longer if you want to win all of the medals and achievements.  There's also a two-player adversarial mode with three game types, one of which doesn't have a corollary in the single player game. There's a soccer game, a race to collect fruit and a multiplayer version of the Brick Invaders game. Winning nets you the praise we all crave with a nice \"Level Complete\" message to signify your success. Alright! Oddly, Bliss Island doesn't support any same-screen multiplayer so you'll have to hop onto Xbox Live to find an opponent.",

        "id": "9090bbbb5861845c2d9cf5f3551301ea",
        "Content": "Every now and then a game comes along that completely remakes what you think about a genre and becomes a benchmark of what developers try to emulate and players come to expect from these games. These titles become legendary with their impact, their scope, and their appeal. Sometimes, they are so well done that they re-ignite the classic argument of whether games could potentially be viewed as art. However, Stalin vs. Martians is not in this league -- It's not even in the same sport. The recently released real-time strategy game from Black Wing Foundation and Mezmer Games attempts to present a tongue-in-cheek, B-movie style mashup of post-World War II Russia and alien invasion. Unfortunately, this game abandons strategy, controls, and even game stability, making it a game that players should avoid like the plague.  There isn't very much of a story behind Stalin vs. Martians. There's no kind of accidental experiments that Stalin was performing to cause them to land on Earth, no captured spaceships being held for ransom, and no government conspiracy of covering up the existence of extraterrestrials. Instead, the premise of the game is that in 1942 Martians suddenly invade Siberia and attack Russia. Stalin, noticing the attack on Russian soil but being too busy with affairs of state to personally oversee the counterattack, sends you, a young commander to repel the aliens. Your job is to fend off the Martians and their plans for global domination before taking the fight back to their home planet and ending their threat to Earth once and for all. At the start of every mission you'll receive a briefing letter from Stalin himself, explaining the overall goal that you'll have to accomplish.   You'll get your info direct from Stalin himself. Clearly, the general scenario is absurd, further exaggerated by music video interludes between some missions that serve no purpose other than to showcase the song of some band. These videos will probably make you smile (or probably stun you with their randomness), but this will quickly wear off as you try to figure out what else is going on within this game. In fact, you'll frequently find yourself asking this question, as the missions themselves range from ridiculously easy to insanely tedious. Some stages can be beaten in about 10 minutes while others (like the destruction of the giant slime) tend to drag on thanks to poor mission design and horridly constructed primary and secondary objectives. Other missions have laughable odds or units that are completely useless against certain enemies, giving you a sense that the balance of power for troops is vastly thrown off. It would be one thing if you had a sense of what units were best against certain troops, but that's nowhere to be found within the game. In fact, because there's no tutorial in the game, coupled with a minimal description of your units and no description of enemy units, Stalin vs. Martians quickly devolves into trial and error before you become mildly comfortable with your soldiers.  Unlike other real time strategy games, Stalin vs. Martians intentionally has an arcade-like take on strategy, which the limited game manual proudly proclaims \u2013 players don't have to ever focus on base building, technology trees, resource gathering, or other standard RTS items. Instead, after enemy units are killed, they'll drop one of five different coins. The first type would be money, which allows you to purchase additional units for your army or magic abilities. That's right, somehow Stalin has access to magic that can make his soldiers invincible for a period of time or paralyze enemies. The other four types of coins are power-ups. The first boosts your armor, while the second improves your attack power. The third power-up augments your speed, while the last heals all damage to your unit. Clearly, you'll want to collect as many of these coins as possible to strengthen your forces so your troops can take on just about any enemy forces you come across.   We are travellers in a strange land. Unfortunately, this collection system highlights a large number of problems with the gameplay. For one thing, unit commands and navigation is abysmal. There are no keyboard shortcuts to get your soldiers to move, attack, hold position, or stop where they're moving, so you're forced to rely on the buttons at the bottom of the screen to issue commands. In many ways, this doesn't really help, because the pathfinding of units, particularly within groups, is horrible. You can point your troops in one direction and watch as a portion of your army stops, steps in a different direction, or flat out refuses to move. This is extremely annoying, especially when you're trying to move into position to attack and yet your troops scatter nonsensically around the map, sometimes placing themselves in the general vicinity of where you sent them.   Confusingly, issuing a direct attack order doesn't always resort in an attack to the target, because some soldiers take their sweet time in performing an attack or refuse to fire while moving even when they're getting swarmed by aliens. The result is that you'll frequently lose troops or units because the game decides it would rather move to some arbitrary position (frequently one that you haven't planned for) instead of blasting incoming enemies. By contrast, your soldiers will frequently fire by themselves if left to their own devices when attacked, often doing much better than when you're commanding them. Since the game delights in this arbitrary nature, even proclaiming \"more cannon fodder\" during the acquiring of reinforcements, you're simply sending meat into the grinder, keeping your fingers crossed that your strikes land when you want them to and cause as much damage as possible with minimal casualties. This is even more of a factor when you're constantly getting attacked from off-screen enemies launching seemingly invisible projectiles at your soldiers.  Combat might seem to be hit or miss, but then again, so are some of the gameplay elements that are on screen as part of the user interface. For example, the bottom right corner of the screen has a large circular area that is completely useless. The only thing that it sometimes displays is an image of the last thing that the mouse pointer has been on. While this can be used to leap the camera to a unit, this doesn't provide any info on that particular soldier or vehicle, or help you know what to send into battle. Selecting units can also be a pain because the game establishes some invisible screen boundaries, making you readjust your camera to potentially select some of your troops onscreen. That's fine during a peaceful break, but not so much during a firefight. Another issue that pops up with the UI is with the reinforcements tab. The prices that are listed within the manual, game briefings, and the tab aren't synched up, making you wonder what the prices actually are. Furthermore, you'll frequently have to click on some of the attack powers multiple times to trigger them, making it seem as though the game doesn't recognize when you've triggered the power itself.   They look like confetti, but they're actually Martians. Then again, this issue could simply be a bug, which would be one of the numerous glitches and bugs that plague the game. Stalin vs. Martians isn't a stable game at all, and I frequently found that I'd be forced to relaunch the game a couple of times per mission after it crashed. These crashes were random, so I could just load up the game and watch it crash, or almost accomplish an objective only to lose all of my progress. It also crashes after each musical interlude, so while amusing for a few seconds, you're also forced to reload the game because it disables your menus afterwards.The game is packed with a ton of insane slowdown even with very few units or items onscreen, because as you destroy an enemy and it tries to track enemy deaths and possible coin drops, the frame rate slows to a crawl. Visual glitches are rampant as well, with tons of screen tearing and flicker that constantly happen onscreen, particularly if you're moving the camera during a battle. Were there an option to adjust your gameplay via game options, that'd be one thing, but the two option menus present are a joke. When one option is, \"Do you like cats,\" and the other answer for keyboard layout is \"Revolutionary,\" you realize that you're not going to have a chance to adjust your visual settings.  These bugs don't even take into account the clearly dated visuals of the game, which looks like it was made close to 15 years ago. Textures are flat and muddy, with minimal detail for anything regardless of the item that you try to zoom in on. The earth levels have very few details to make themselves stand out from one another, while the missions on Mars look bland and unimpressive. While there is some tolerable animation for some elements, like the slime trees, UFOs, and even the \"organic\" life growing in slime that your tanks can roll over and crush, the rest of it looks extremely bland. Alien units range from large, cartoonish orbs to large bugs and even stranger boss characters, but some of their infantry is so small that they look like colored dots or other little blips on the screen that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. The same can be said for some of your soldiers. While water looks completely horrible in the game, the only decent environmental thing is the shadows that float across certain areas in the environment, which is a nice addition, but clouds don't remain solitary and cast the same shadow on the same plot of ground.   Die you weird...blue...things! The sound is perhaps the strongest feature for Stalin, with a large collection of Russian, Euro-pop, and techno beats to keep your attention. Curiously, the game switches from background music that plays as you move your troops in position to a faster attack beat when you're in the midst of battle. It, coupled with the musical interludes, are vastly improved over the insipid comments that your soldiers throw out as you move them around the map. Hearing, \"My name is Ivan. I like you,\" over and over again will make your ears bleed."

Aquarium is just like its fantasy brother, only without the fantasy. It's still a pointless title that is closer to a screen saver than a game, but now it's got fishies instead of dolphins. On one hand you expect fish to be boring, on the other hand, you can't even make them fake-eat each other.  The main goal of Aquarium is to, I don't know, make the fish happy? The developers never seemed to bother to create objectives. I examined the instruction booklet and still couldn't figure out what I'm doing with five tanks and various tropical fish.  Saying Aquarium is casual implies that it holds some appeal towards the casual gamer market. I'd say the game is more catatonic than casual. At least the Fantasy Aquarium had killer whales and penguins and crap. This has regular fish. All the animals in Aquarium behave like any other boring Wal-Mart fish. I know, that's how fish are, but why would I buy a video game to simulate something as boring as fish? They don't even react when I tap on their tank. Of course they don't have much to react to. Really the only thing I was able to do to my fishes was drop food in their tank. Then I got to watch in rapt fascination as my pets did nothing at all and the food just magically disappeared.  There are no points in Aquarium. No money to buy stuff with. You can buy as many lionfish as you want, then let them all die and just buy some more. The big pay off is just watching the fish swim back and forth while you listen to tedious, ocean inspired music that you might find on a bargain CD in a real aquarium's gift shop. It's supposed to be relaxing, but the music is grating and the tank really bland. There's a decoration option, but that made things worse.   Trust me, it's barely more exciting when they're moving. To make this painfully dull experience more fun I utilized the tank customization tool. From there players are able to decorate their tanks to make them more pleasant. The problem is that everything in the game is so hideous that the tank always looks tacky. The coral and stone arch decorations might be kind of cool if they were just flat, pixilated clip art. Worse yet, the fish pass right through the objects. The tank's wall and background can be tiled with neon colors or weird, clashing wallpaper. It just ends up making the whale and dolphin tanks look like they're located on the Vegas strip. And not the nice section of the strip either. More like down by Circus Circus.  There are numerous aquatic creatures to unlock, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. Somehow I did stuff that made new fish appear in the selection screen. Of course the only fish I had ever heard of (Clown Fish, Lion Fish, Angel Fish, that fish that Dory was in Finding Nemo...) are already unlocked from the start, and there isn't room to have a lot of animals anyway.",

        "Content": "When I gave Elden Ring a 10 two years ago, I did so not just because it\u2019s an incredible game, but because it also raised the bar for open-world games as a whole. The way it encourages exploration, rewards curiosity, and challenges you to find your own individual solutions to difficult combat encounters by including tons of different viable weapons, spells, and other build options is absolutely exemplary. Now, FromSoftware is back to raise the bar on everyone yet again, this time when it comes to what you\u2019d expect from a \"simple\" DLC. Shadow of the Erdtree may not do anything radically different from the base game, but this expansion somehow feels like a scaled-down version of that same experience that recaptures all of the magic of playing Elden Ring for the first time, with more content packed within than many fully priced games. Its unexpectedly large realm is filled with new secrets, new discoveries, a ton of new build options to experiment with, as well as some of the most challenging and unforgettable boss battles Souls fans will have ever seen. I strolled into Shadow of the Erdtree thinking I was some kind of Elden Lord badass, having defeated Malenia , Mohg , Placidusax , the Elden Beast , and every other big threat around. My level 150 character was armed with fully upgraded gear and the maximum number of flasks\u2026 but let me tell you, it did not take very long for the Realm of Shadow to humble me. Even though the only requirement to access the new areas is to beat Radahn and Mohg \u2013 which, granted, is no small feat \u2013 you\u2019re going to want to over prepare before stepping foot into this new arena, because it is brutal . FromSoftware definitely skirts the line between fair and unfair with some of the later boss designs in particular, perhaps getting closer than ever. But crucially, it never actually crosses that threshold, and that masterful tightrope walk \u2013 along with some truly spectacular boss design \u2013 results in some of the most thrilling and satisfying bosses Elden Ring, and the entire Soulslike genre , has to offer.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It\u2019s not just the quality of those fights, either: Erdtree has them in quantity, too. According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses, with 10 of those being the big, showstopper fights that reward you with a Remembrance upon defeat. Compare that to the more than 100 in the base game , and it\u2019s a significant chunk. According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses. \u201c When you bring up the map , it may not seem like The Realm of Shadow is that big, but it is incredibly dense because it\u2019s stacked in layers. Paths lead upwards toward ruins suspended in the sky, others delve deep beneath the surface, and some even pull you in directions you might not have believed you could even be pulled. You might find a hidden ladder tucked away in the far corner of a castle rampart, only to follow that trail for an hour before it eventually spills out into a totally new, otherwise-inaccessible area. But even with all of the discoveries to be made, I never felt lost or unsure of where I could or should go next. The main goal of this DLC is to follow the footsteps of the demigod Miquella , who left his flesh behind and fled to the Realm of Shadow. These footsteps are marked by large crosses that elegantly serve as subtle signposts to let you know when you\u2019re in the vicinity of a plot-critical path, without it ever feeling like your hand is being held as you\u2019re nudged in one explicit direction.

Artorias of the Abyss (Dark Souls 1) The Lost Crowns Trilogy (Dark Souls 2) Ashes of Ariandel (Dark Souls 3) The Ringed City (Dark Souls 3) The Old Hunters (Bloodborne) Answer See Results Apart from the main quest, there\u2019s a whole host of new NPCs, including seven followers of Miquella that you\u2019ll encounter at various points in the journey. Each of them have their own small questline that ties into the main story, and those can even have an effect on some of the latter boss battles, depending on your actions. And while I consider myself a fairly casual enjoyer of Elden Ring\u2019s extensive lore compared to some of the scholars out there, even my limited knowledge of the deeper plot let me appreciate some pretty fantastic, eye-opening revelations towards the end of this story that are well worth the effort of getting to. Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature. \u201c It took me about 25 hours or so to beat the final boss of Shadow of the Erdtree , but I could easily see myself putting in another 15 or 20 on just this one playthrough. I still have a handful of optional bosses I need to go back and cross off my list, areas on my map I haven\u2019t fully explored, weapons and skills I haven\u2019t gotten to play around with yet, and sidequests I still want to follow to completion. That\u2019s pretty much exactly like when I completed my review of the base game after about 80 hours, which makes sense because Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature. It condenses the whole experience down to something comparatively compact, all of it satisfyingly tuned specifically for end-game characters who thought they\u2019d seen it all. What We Said About Elden Ring in 2022 It is no exaggeration to say that Elden Ring is FromSoftware\u2019s largest and most ambitious game yet, and that ambition has more than paid off. Even after 87 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that included some of the most challenging fights I\u2019ve ever fought, and innumerable surprises, there are still bosses that I left on the table, secrets that I\u2019ve yet to uncover, sidequests that I missed out on, tons of weapons, spells, and skills that I\u2019ve never used. And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I\u2019ve barely been able to scratch the surface of. Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven\u2019t changed much from what we\u2019ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads I didn\u2019t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I\u2019m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I\u2019ve ever played. Like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before it, Elden Ring is one that we\u2019ll be looking back on as a game that moved a genre forward. \u2013 Mitchell Saltzman, Februrary 23, 2022 Score: 10 Read the full Elden Ring review Weapons of Choice While I haven\u2019t had any \u201choly ****\u201d moments of awe like the first time I took the elevator down to the Siofra River , exploration and discovery throughout the Realm of Shadow is still a delight thanks to its stellar art design, a great variety in the areas you get to explore, and the tantalizing rewards pretty much everywhere you turn. There are eight brand-new weapon types , ranging from throwing knives to beast claws to giant odachi samurai swords . My favorite of the new arsenal, though, is the light greatsword , specifically the Milady. True to its name, the Milady has a very regal-looking moveset with combos that flow nicely into each other and hit hard, but are also relatively fast compared to actual greatswords. For me, it\u2019s a sweet spot. I actually swapped off of my powerful dual Bandit Curved Sword  bleed build (albeit, minus the White Mask , which I ruined my chance to get) to instead rock a Strength/Dexterity-focused build using one of these and found great success for the majority of the DLC.

However, in all my travels I found that while the new weapon types are fun \u2013 there\u2019s certainly an appeal to going hand-to-hand against an army of hands \u2013 none of them ultimately measured up to the strength of the weapons that I carried over from the base game. It\u2019s totally possible that there are some talismans I was missing to really make the new ones sing, but I was hoping to go through the entirety of Erdtree with a brand-new build. Instead, I found myself swapping back to my bread-and-butter bleed build to get the kind of damage I needed when the going got tough \u2013 but hey, that build did have two years to get optimized through the original endgame. There are so many promising new builds that I couldn't help but wish Larval Tears were more plentiful. \u201c Besides, variety is the spice of life, and Erdtree is one hot dish. Not only are there a ton of new weapons, there are also plenty of new spells, Ashes of War , Spirit Ash summons , and talismans to cover an enormous range of different playstyles. There\u2019s now a talisman that enhances two-handed attacks; one that decreases spellcasting time dramatically, but causes you to take increased damage; another that increases the damage of abilities that involve stances; and another still that increases your damage every time you defeat an enemy. Yes, there are also plenty that are just better versions of very useful talismans you probably already have, and there\u2019s no shame in sticking to what works. There are so many promising new builds that I couldn\u2019t help but wish Larval Tears were more plentiful so I could respec my character a little more freely, as I started to run out by the time I finished Erdtree\u2019s campaign. I still have a ton of different builds I want to try, and I\u2019m already happily onto my second playthrough to see them. The Joy of Freedom The journey through The Realm of Shadow is structured very similarly to The Lands Between , in that the map is split up into a number of different regions. Right from the get-go, you\u2019re able to head anywhere you want to: you could follow the initial Miquella Cross to the first big \u201clegacy dungeon,\u201d called Belurat, and deal with the new horrific scorpion enemies; or head across a bridge to the east and work your way over to the magic filled Castle Ensis where you have to deal with this jerk (where you have go up against one of the most challenging bosses of the DLC right away), or find a way to bypass the need to go through either of those and get straight to the Scadu Altus, which largely serves as the central hub of the Realm of Shadow. Then you could head directly toward the Shadow Keep fighting your way to the top of it in order to take on one of the major bosses, or going through one of its other exits to explore otherwise inaccessible parts of the map. It\u2019s a liberating sense of freedom, and the same masterclass level of open-world design as the base game, just on a scale that isn\u2019t quite so vast. Of course, whether or not you should make a mad dash towards the Shadow Keep is another question entirely. Even though this is endgame content and you probably won\u2019t be leveling up quite as fast as you did in the original campaign, there\u2019s a separate power-scaling system that only works while you\u2019re within the Realm of Shadow. Scattered throughout the lands are Scadutree Fragments that you can collect and turn in at Sites of Grace to increase your overall damage and resistances. Likewise, you can also find Revered Spirit Ash blessings to increase the damage and survivability of your Spirit Ash Summons. These are two very smart inclusions as they add a much-needed sense of progression, a valuable reward for exploration, and something else to hunt for if you\u2019re getting wrecked by a boss and need to come back when you\u2019re stronger \u2013 all while cleverly preserving some of the original endgame\u2019s balance if you\u2019re bravely tackling this DLC before circling back to beat it.

You can read more about our review policies and philosophy here . Every time I return to Stardew Valley after a new patch drops, I ask myself: why is the pull still so strong? Newer farming games have improved on many of the mechanics its developer, ConcernedApe, introduced way back in 2016, adding interesting twists to the old-school blueprint it repopularized \u2013 so in 2024, why is Stardew Valley still my favorite? But that\u2019s just it: Stardew Valley is the model for farming games now. It may not be quite as refined or as streamlined as some of the sims it inspired, but none have managed to capture the raw lightning in a bottle that makes it so enduring, either. That\u2019s partly because Stardew Valley might be a \u201ccozy\u201d pixel art haven, but it\u2019s also tough . Managing your time and juggling dozens of competing priorities is an endless challenge, and it\u2019s in this superbly balanced dance that I find an intense satisfaction that simply cannot be beat. Pair that with a nearly decade-long parade of new quirky details to discover every time I start up a fresh farm, and Stardew Valley becomes truly timeless.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There is no small measure of irony to the fact that the start of Stardew Valley plucks you from a soul-crushing desk job and plops you into a quaint little farming town\u2026 where you must then become a tireless, people-pleasing perfectionist. Oh, you thought you were just going to be pleasantly plucking weeds and planting parsnips on your late grandpa\u2019s abandoned farm? No, you aren\u2019t just a farmer after your move to Pelican Town. Like any typical entry-level intern, you are expected to wear many hats. Restoring the Community Center to its former glory may be fulfilling labor, but you\u2019ll also need to level up your skills across the board, from foraging to fishing to mining, and even monster fighting. Don\u2019t forget to smoodge your way into the hearts of the lovable townspeople by showering them with gifts every day. How else are you supposed to find your life partner? Multitasking efficiently is a deceptively tense balancing act. \u201c I\u2019m a returning fan, so I know what I want to accomplish on each new run, but for those new to this sensation you might find that, at first, Stardew Valley gives you so much freedom and so many options that it can feel kind of aimless. Besides the odd request from your neighbors arriving in the mail, you are given no larger objective \u2013 just this broad rags-to-riches goal of fixing up your grandpa\u2019s farm and the town by delivering bundles of goods. It\u2019s only as you start to progress through the seasons that you realize what\u2019s at stake. Sure, you could play at your own leisure and still find plenty of joy in a more relaxed, unoptimized pace. But you\u2019ll soon come to understand that forgetting to gift Jodi that cauliflower she wanted in spring could mean waiting a whole year before you get back to the season where you can grow that crop again, and thus learn to make time for the things that matter most. Stardew Valley Gameplay Screenshots - 1.6 Update 72 Images This makes Stardew Valley a deceptively tense balancing act of managing your time and multitasking efficiently. There are plenty of things to unlock that will make that easier, be they cooking recipes for meals that increase your stamina so you can accomplish more each day or upgraded tools to help you till the earth and water your crops quicker. But the cost of unlocking those things usually comes in the form of grinding for experience points in the skill you are trying to improve or collecting a certain number of required items. Do you want to unlock the greenhouse before the end of Year 1? Well, then you\u2019d better make sure you grow enough gold-quality melons that summer to complete the Pantry Bundle in the Community Center , otherwise you\u2019ll have to wait until Year 2. This is why playing Stardew Valley alongside a good game guide can be day and night. Like many \u201cold-school\u201d games, Stardew Valley doesn\u2019t always tell you everything you need to know. Not every quest has hints to follow, and when it comes to finding some seasonal items such as specific fish, you\u2019re going in completely blind. There\u2019s definitely joy to be found in figuring something out for yourself, but I only found myself truly thriving once I realized that there was an endless dirge of strategy guides and community resources to be found online. You\u2019re always incentivized to explore areas you might not otherwise. \u201c While this might sound like an overly rigid slog, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like one. Seasons are so fleeting and the time you have to accomplish your goals is so limited that you\u2019re always incentivized to explore areas you might not have otherwise in order to accomplish them quicker. For example, if you want to unlock the minecarts (a handy mode of fast travel), you\u2019ll need to push yourself to explore the mines. Each floor is randomly generated, and breaking open rocks to find materials while cutting down slimes and other monsters quickly evolves into a harrowing dungeon crawl. As you delve deeper, you will encounter dangerous and strange new enemies with different attacks and harder hits, and it\u2019s fun to prepare the right weapons and stat-boosting food to survive. Lose all your health (or run out of energy and fail to make it home in time) and you\u2019ll pass out, costing you cash or even your precious treasure depending on which character randomly finds you and brings you back to the surface, making each trip down into the mines feel fresh and potentially nerve-racking. What's your favorite thing to do in Stardew Valley? Farming/raising animals Fishing Combat/mining Making friends/dating Completing bundles/quests Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results If combat isn\u2019t your speed, there are so many other things to do that you could easily put off exploring the mines for a bit in favor of farming, foraging, or even socializing \u2013 and don\u2019t even get me started on fishing. (Okay, if you insist!) Stardew Valley\u2019s infamous fishing minigame is both the bane of my existence and my greatest obsession. It\u2019s such a simple activity: cast in your line, snag a fish, and then keep a green bar overlapped with a bouncing fish icon until you\u2019ve successfully reeled it in. And yet, nothing is more devastating than carefully tapping my left mouse button for a whole minute to keep a Pufferfish on the line, only to break concentration for a moment and watch my progress crash into the red. On the other hand, nothing is quite as elating as finally catching an elusive Catfish on a rainy day. Every fish has different behaviors and movement patterns that dictate how they wiggle around on the hook, adding an interesting layer of strategy to recognizing them; some are easier to predict and others will have you on the verge of frustrated tears. It is quite literally my favorite activity. The joy of Stardew Valley isn\u2019t just in making the most of its jam-packed days, it\u2019s in all the little quirks and secrets you discover along the way. From heartwarming cutscenes with villagers to bizarre one-off quests that could have you delivering maple syrup to a strangely cognizant bear, truly, so much character has been injected into this idyllic town. This is the only game where I can build a pond on my farm only to then get absurd demands from the talking fish within it. What is a fish going to do with three Omni Geodes anyway? Time to go mining in the Skull Cavern, I guess. Fast days entice you to stick around for \u201cjust one more.\" \u201c You\u2019re rarely doing the same thing for very long because it takes less than 15 minutes to play through an in-game day, a pace which only further entices me to stick around for \u201cjust one more\u201d every session. Because time is so tight, it often feels like you never quite have enough to do everything you might want to \u2013 that may sound frustrating initially, but it\u2019s actually so absorbing. It forces you to strategize and plan out your tasks in advance, fueling that obsessive urge to keep playing even more in order to keep from leaving some goal only half finished. In this way, each morning feels like embarking on a new dungeon run. How far will you get today? Will luck be on your side or will it work against you? Stardew Valley feels endless, which is both thrilling and overwhelming. Yes, technically, there are two ways in which you could see yourself \u201cbeating\u201d it. The first is to fully restore the Community Center by gifting the adorable little Junimo spirits specific bundles of local goodies, which you either have to grow or hunt down yourself, and the second is to achieve total \u201cPerfection,\u201d Stardew Valley\u2019s version of 100% completion. Either one will have you planting vegetables, growing fruit trees, and raising animals on your farm, all of which follow suit with Stardew Valley as a whole by being fairly straightforward on the surface, but deviously deep if you want to maximize both the quantity and quality of your produce. It will likely take you more than one in-game year just to complete the Community Center on your first playthrough; with 28 days in each of the four seasons, that means this challenge alone can easily take dozens of hours, and I loved every minute of it. Hearing about that scale of time commitment could make it seem like an intimidating task, but this is the true appeal of Stardew Valley: It is a collector\u2019s paradise. Just when you think you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll stumble upon another list of tasks to delightfully check off. Complete the Community Center bundles and now the local fisherman, Willy, is asking you to help repair his old boat. Next thing you know, you\u2019re traveling to a totally new island that\u2019s mostly inhabited by voracious parrots. Of course, the only way to explore this entirely separate area and unlock all the cool things introduced there is by feeding the parrots the Golden Walnuts found hidden throughout the island . It gives you another enticing goal to distract you from whatever you may have been doing before, even if just for a few days. It could easily take over 100 hours to discover everything it has to offer. \u201c This deluge of options is in no small part thanks to all of the excellent free updates Stardew Valley has sporadically received since its initial launch in 2016, tantalizingly pushing that finish line further and further out of reach for its dedicated players. ConcernedApe has added co-op multiplayer, cool new starting farm layouts, tons of additional crops and seasonal events, expanded post-game activities, and innumerable bug fixes \u2013 not to mention plenty of silly things like the recent craze sweeping the valley: drinking mayonnaise. I\u2019ve lost count of how many farms I\u2019ve started over the years, including one on the unique new Meadowlands Farm layout that was introduced in the most recent 1.6 update (only on PC as of this writing) and I still haven\u2019t found those darn raccoons it added! It could quite literally take you over 100 hours to discover everything Stardew Valley has to offer\u2026 and by the time you do, there may have been another patch. And did I mention the lore scattered throughout it all? Because, yes, Stardew Valley is steeped in the stuff. At first, the people of Pelican Town might come off as stand-offish and sometimes even cold. But the more you chat with each villager and give gifts to increase your \u201cfriendship\u201d level with them, the more you will unveil just how messy these people are. The kind but strangely vain mayor has a secret lover; we\u2019re all pretty sure that Abigail, our resident video-game loving goth girl, has a mysterious origin story to discover. Heck, you don\u2019t even get to meet one of the villagers until you\u2019ve reached Year 2 because he\u2019s been away fighting in a war against some fantastical evil empire. I love getting to feel like the town snoop, prying into the personal details of everybody\u2019s lives without any of the repercussions. If anything, the messiness of these characters makes them feel more grounded and endearing. Shailyn's Favorite Farming Games My favorite farming sims and farm-adjacent games!

There are 12 eligible villagers residing in Pelican Town , all of whom you can get to know by chatting them up once a day and gifting their favorite things. This is one area where Stardew can, admittedly, fall a bit flat relative to the high points of other games with a focus on dating. While it\u2019s great that you can date any of these villagers regardless of gender, it doesn\u2019t quite make up for the lack of both interesting personalities and diversity amongst your choices for romantic partners. If there\u2019s romance available in a game, I want to feel torn by the decision of who to pursue. But here, my indecision over who to marry initially has less to do with being too smitten and more to do with the fact that all of the options are similarly\u2026 unappealing. That being said, I don\u2019t think all of the villagers of Stardew Valley are necessarily supposed to be immediately \u201clikable\u201d in a traditional sense. Just as it often is in real life, it\u2019s only after taking the time to get to know them through special conversations and unlockable events that some of them start to look more attractive and complex as people. But while their larger stories are generally well written, they don\u2019t necessarily make for the most exciting romantic partners to woo right out of the gate.

Not only does this standout sequel manage to masterfully imagine what a massive, big-budget RPG might look like in VR, it astonishingly reinvents itself several times throughout its 90+ hour runtime, making those hours absolutely fly by. The four playable characters are extraordinarily different from each other and mastering them all is a blast, the deep RPG mechanics and loads of secrets to discover make the temptation to keep the headset on for just another half hour or two a seriously troubling habit, and the combat, exploration, and puzzles make every new dungeon an action-packed, deeply satisfying adventure that easily surpasses almost everything that\u2019s previously been accomplished in virtual reality. The fact that there\u2019s also an excellent roguelite mode one could easily lose dozens of hours in, and that\u2019s just casually thrown in as an optional activity for the heck of it, is just mind-boggling. Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 is the kind of landmark game-changer that only comes around once in a blue moon, and in a year already jam-packed with extremely good games, this is easily one of my favorites. What we said about Asgard's Wrath Asgard\u2019s Wrath is a fantastic action-adventure RPG that can stand with the best of them on consoles and PC, but the fact that it\u2019s meticulously crafted for VR means it sits in a league of its own. Asgard\u2019s Wrath represents something VR enthusiasts have been waiting for for years now: the first absolute must-play virtual reality game that feels fully fleshed-out rather than a glorified tech demo. Its beautiful world, excellent combat, great interface, and straightforward but detailed story come together to form something spectacular. - Gabriel Moss, October 10, 2019 Score: 9.4 Read our full Asgard's Wrath review . This is a game that takes all the most important parts of your Skyrims and your Legends of Zelda and reimagines them for virtual reality from the ground up with amazing success. Playing as a god who possesses mortals to help them fulfill their destinies, you\u2019ll roam interesting open-world areas from vast deserts to spooky planes of the afterlife, navigate treacherous dungeons, loot chests, recharge and socialize back at the hideout with the NPCs you befriend along the way, and even kick back with a fishing rod, \u2018cause why the heck not? It's true that Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 might not look or perform as well as games running on high-end hardware, but it more than makes up for that deficit with its innovative ideas and incredibly fun gameplay, and pushes the limits on what\u2019s possible on its native device. In other words, this is the Tears of the Kingdom of the Meta Quest 3 . It transcends hardware limitations by just crushing it in every other area. This sequel improves and expands upon just about everything. \u201c Building upon the many successes of its extremely good and still worth-playing predecessor, this superb sequel improves and expands upon just about everything, from combat and exploration to the significantly more fleshed out animal companions who accompany you on your journey. Solving puzzles and fighting massive bosses in dungeons hits all the same highs as old-school, 3D adventures with Link; running around the open world might not go nearly as deep as, say, a classic Bethesda RPG, but it\u2019s above and beyond anything we\u2019ve seen in VR to date at the same rough level as something like The Outer Worlds in offering tons of reasons to go off the beaten path and explore to your heart\u2019s content. You never know when you might find a sewer level hidden underneath a small crack in a mountain or a terrifying optional boss lurking within an out-of-the-way cave, and that makes every minute of exploration absolutely worth it. The story picks up where the last game left off, with you controlling a God with the ability to possess and empower mortals who was left in a cell to rot after being very predictably betrayed by the famously untrustworthy God of Mischief: Loki. If you didn\u2019t play the first one, you won\u2019t catch some of the references to those characters and events, but that backstory isn\u2019t really necessary to understand and enjoy the drama here. Thankfully, there\u2019s a really strong recap to catch you up, but all you really need to know is that Loki\u2019s not a very nice guy and you really hate him. After being plucked from your prison by a higher power, you\u2019re sent on a seemingly unrelated quest to Egypt while you wait for your opportunity to get revenge on the Norse trickster. Asgard's Wrath 2 - Gameplay Screenshots (Meta Quest 3) 62 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The good news is the decision to move away from the now-overused Norse mythology into the Egyptian pantheon is a smart one that gives us a nice change of pace as well as a fresh set of faces to become besties with, along with some new sights to see outside of frozen mountains and stone halls. That redirected focus means little progress is made in telling the overarching story, which I didn\u2019t consider a bad thing since I was more invested in the loveable cast and sandy pyramids of Egypt anyway. I quite enjoyed hanging out with the likes of Castor, the heroic jock who helped me craft traps and bait, and Horus, the orphaned god who\u2019s down on his luck and severely in need of a friend. More importantly, the four self-contained stories told through each of the playable characters had more of my attention anyway, serving as bite-sized tales that carried the moment-to-moment drama while the larger cosmic conflict loomed in the background. Most surprisingly of all is just how much content there is! VR games have a well-earned reputation as being generally short and sweet, but Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 defies expectations. Though I tried to complete most side quests and kept an eye on all the chests placed just out of reach in the open world, I didn\u2019t even approach a completionist run and still found myself sinking in an astonishing 91 hours before I rolled credits. You might decide to take a break from the main quest to partake in a slingshot shooting gallery or a pinball-like minigame while at the hideout, or stumble onto a quest where you possess a monkey in a completely optional story tangent, or craft special bait to lure a giant scorpion out of hiding to duel you to the death. This isn\u2019t an RPG that cuts any corners or feels limited by VR. \u201c You\u2019ll also find random encounters while exploring where rifts in reality pull you into a pocket dimension to complete a mini objective, like engaging in some puzzle-platforming while avoiding traps or fighting off some goons. Some of these even have fun mixed-reality components where you\u2019ll find yourself back in your real home fighting off evil minions through portals ripped in your living room (a nice use of the Quest 3\u2019s AR capabilities that won\u2019t show up if you\u2019re on older hardware). I don\u2019t know what dark alchemy developer Sanzaru Games concocted to get this massive RPG to work on the completely wireless Quest 3 (unlike the first one, there is no PC version to tether to), but this isn\u2019t an RPG that cuts any corners or feels limited (at least in its scope) by the VR medium. Quite the opposite: it leans into that immersion and never stops giving your reasons to spend time living in it. There\u2019s even a social element where you can leave a projection of your avatar out in the world to help give others hints or simply dance for no reason, just to make sure you don\u2019t get lonely out there among the fires of Muspelheim. Which mythology should Asgard\u2019s Wrath explore next? Chinese Greek Arthurian Aztec Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results Of course, helping a quartet of mortals fulfill their destinies is bound to involve lots of fighting, and Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 knocks it out of the park here too. While the first entry\u2019s combat was great, it primarily focused on melee, and forced you to play defensively and whittle down opposing shields before pressing the attack. But in the sequel, you\u2019re given a whole lot more freedom. Now you can go on the offensive to remove enemy shields, play it safe with ranged attacks, yank flying enemies to the ground with your whip, or use special abilities to do fancy things like charge at one of the magnificently toned humanoid lizards to knock it flat on its back. Combat also benefits from the fact that enemy AI is surprisingly crafty, and will grow wise to your tricks if you lean too heavily on any one tactic. For example, if you insist on repeatedly throwing your ranged weapon at one of the oddly alluring crocodile people they won\u2019t let that slide for long, and suddenly you\u2019ll see them catch your weapon in their muscular hands before lobbing it right back in your face. That means you won\u2019t be able to just spam your way through encounters, encouraging you to engage with all the tools available to you on whichever hero you\u2019re using and think quick on your feet. When that all came together I felt like a complete badass, pulling off chains like striking down one enemy with my sword before shooting an arrow at another across the room, then swatting an enemy projectile back in the face of a third chiseled reptile, all without taking a hit \u2013 there\u2019s really no better way to experience that than in VR. There\u2019s quite a bit of challenge for those who would seek it. \u201c If there\u2019s one area for improvement when it comes to combat, it\u2019s definitely in the enemy variety. I quite enjoyed doing battle with the surprisingly attractive bipedal crocodiles that make up the vast majority of combatants in the first half of the adventure, but you\u2019ll definitely be seeing quite a lot of them. Even if those scaly Adonises did awaken a part of me I didn\u2019t know existed, it takes quite a bit of time before you start seeing the mummies, snakes, parasitic bugs, and not-as-sexy regular crocodiles that fill the rest of your bestiary. Likewise, there are a couple repeated minibosses every now and again that didn\u2019t feel entirely necessary, like the three times I fought a big cat-serpent monster. And if you\u2019re into challenging combat like yours truly, you\u2019re in luck, because as someone who played the entire odyssey on the hardest difficulty, I can attest that there\u2019s quite a bit of challenge for those who would seek it. I died more than my fair share of times at the hands of my beloved lizard folk, who relentlessly surround you and work together to ensnare you with melee and ranged attacks that will gut unwary adventurers in no time flat. Boss fights are, sadly, the exception here: rather than putting your skills to the test, they mostly serve the role of rewarding you with a power fantasy finale to each act (still, those are all really cool). TieGuyTravis' Favorite VR Games See All 1 Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 Sanzaru Games 2 Half-Life: Alyx Valve 3 Asgard\u2019s Wrath Sanzaru Games 4 Synapse nDreams 5 Beat Saber Hyperbolic Magnetism 6 Pistol Whip Cloudhead Games 7 I Expect You to Die Schell Games 8 Demeo Resolution Games 9 Trover Saves the Universe Squanch Games 10 Superhot VR Superhot Team One of the most impressive things Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 manages to fit into its enormous adventure is its four playable protagonists, each with their own weapons, abilities, storylines, and open-world map to let them loose on. You learn the ropes as Abraxas, a traditional sword-and-shield warrior who serves as an approachable starting point, but then you\u2019ll find yourself controlling increasingly more outlandish mortals until suddenly you\u2019re throwing your own decapitated head at your foes to possess them. One of the more inspired heroes, Cyrene, is a river naiad with an affinity for aquatic life, so all of her weapons are living sea creatures, like a hilarious octopus harp that pulls double duty as a musical instrument and a bow to deal damage at a distance, and a lovable eel that wraps around her arm so its tongue can be used as a melee weapon. Each playstyle is such a departure from the last that finishing one saga and unlocking the next character feels like diving into a completely different game, which does wonders to extend the shelf life in an adventure that already would feel massive with just the first character \u2013 especially by the standards of virtual reality. Even the more mundane characters are still interesting and feel great to play, owing to an abundance of neat mechanics that help you solve puzzles and defeat bosses. For example, Abraxas might seem like a standard melee character at first, but by the end of his adventure you\u2019ll have a whole bag of cool tricks like turning your sword into a whip to yank yourself toward enemies and across gaps, and a throwing ax that can change direction mid-flight to activate hidden buttons or swat baddies from around corners like you\u2019re an Egyptian Force-user. Even after dozens of hours, it kept introducing new ideas. \u201c Later, when I found myself controlling a hero with no shield and minimal melee options, I had to reconfigure my entire brain around ranged gameplay and a whole new set of abilities, like a squid turret I could toss out to lay down suppressing fire, or a throwable mine that could be shot with a bow to send my enemies to the afterlife with a fiery explosion. Even after dozens of hours, when I finally unlocked the final character, they kept introducing new ideas, like prayer beads that can be used as either a shield, a whip, or to create portals to aid in puzzle solving. Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 just never ran out of fantastic ideas right up until the credits, and I can\u2019t remember the last time an RPG was this good at keeping me on my toes. That variety and depth with each character extends into the incredibly dense including skill trees for each hero, which unlock tons of buffs and meaningful special abilities that add some more interesting ways to use your equipment. One skill lets the your elf archer character Alvida turn her mines into turrets when she shoots an arrow at them; another that lets Abraxas toss his shield, then whip it to turn it into a deadly pinball that bounces around the level. Then there\u2019s the usual stuff like crafting, which lets you build better versions of your weapons and armor for you and your companions, including upgrades that add slots for elemental runes or grant bonus effects (and just plain look cooler), as well as potions that can be brewed, food that can be cooked, and traps that can be devised to use in battle. They give you a whole lot of reasons to gather coins and crafting materials, and in all my time hanging out in Egypt and beyond, I never once found myself in a situation where I was not in dire need of one material or another. It\u2019s also impressive just how good the puzzles are, owing to the way they challenge you to make use of each of the heroes\u2019 unique arsenal as well as your companions\u2019 abilities to get through each area. You\u2019ll find clever sections where you have to throw Abraxas\u2019 ax onto a button, then use its redirecting ability to slide it in the right direction, or use Cyrene\u2019s harp octopus to play a musical tune to a sea creature to guide it over to a flower to grow a vine you can climb. Other areas were less about being smart and more about using my reflexes and the specific abilities of my hero to platform through dangerous, trap-filled areas and narrowly avoid death. Shockingly all that yanking myself across gaps with a whip and wall running past swinging death traps gave me absolutely no motion sickness and made me feel like the badass god I was playing as. The best puzzles though, combine your mortal and your godly forms by allowing you to toggle back and forth between them. As a giant being you can manipulate the world around you, then jump back into your puny mortal form to get through the area. In one such memorable level, I helped Abraxas get around an otherwise-unnavigable shipwreck by simply picking up and moving pieces of its shattered hull so he could wall run on them to the next area. Those sections especially managed to keep me on toes with creative stuff like that right up until the end, and that\u2019s no small feat. There are half as many companions, but each is far more fleshed out. \u201c Another area this sequel improves upon the original is with its animal companions, who accompany you in your travels and each have a unique ability to help with puzzle solving. Subira, a panther turned humanoid, is a combat-focused helper who can make ghostly objects appear and disappear within the world, while Pa-ahket is a support-focused bird who can make certain platforms float in the air. Unlike the original Asgard\u2019s Wrath, this time each follower has their own backstory and social links that reward building relationships with your bestial comrades, encouraging you to talk to them, give them high fives and fist bumps after a successful battle, and hand out edible gifts to gain their favor. It\u2019s also really awesome that each of these companions has an alternate non-humanoid form that can be swapped out instantaneously, allowing you to do extremely useful things like ride them as a mount to cross large areas quickly or hang onto Pa-ahket\u2019s feet to glide across gaps. The only downside here is that there are half as many companions as there were in the previous game, but the very worthwhile tradeoff is that each is far more fleshed out. With so much packed into Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2, it\u2019s not very surprising that it does suffer from occasional performance issues on the Quest 3, and the odd bug here and there. You can expect the framerate to hitch every so often (which is especially jarring in VR), some long loading screens, and even a hard crash or two that will pluck you out of Egypt and send you back to your less interesting garage. I also encountered a couple annoying bugs, like one time where my companion got frozen by an enemy\u2019s ice attack then never broke free even after that ice was destroyed. However, these issues were rarely bad enough to infuriate me and certainly not common enough to be much of an issue. Instead, they were the same kinds of wonkiness I\u2019d expect from any other open-world game of this size, and in fact I\u2019d put this one on the less troublesome side of normal. Every 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given 66 Images That said, even when it\u2019s performing its best, the visual limitations of the wireless Meta Quest headsets are clear in more than a few moments. Some characters and textures can look a bit blurry or grainy at times, and there\u2019s pop-in when traveling the open world. Frankly, it\u2019s impressive that it looks as good as it does given its scope and PC-free wireless nature (the Quest is, effectively, a phone strapped to your face) and there are definitely times, like during boss fights against enormous godlike foes, where I was blown away by how beautiful it all is. I just can\u2019t help but wonder what might have been possible if this didn\u2019t also have to be able to run on the Meta Quest 2 , since that seems to be holding it back visually \u2013 or, if like the original, we were allowed to play this one on PC via AirLink. Maybe then Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 could withstand aesthetic comparisons to the likes of Half-Life: Alyx , but as it stands that\u2019s just not a fair fight. Still, I don\u2019t know that any amount of graphical fidelity gained would be worth being tethered in an adventure with this amount of spinning, platforming, and riding giant hippopotamuses across the desert, but here\u2019s hoping the Quest 3 version gets some more facelifts in the future. With all the countless ways Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 already gives you too many excuses to spend your time in its world, it\u2019s completely bonkers that they also threw in an extremely robust roguelite mode as well. This infinitely replayable game lets you explore miniature dungeon modules that become increasingly deadly as you see how far in you can go, in the hopes of setting a high score and bringing back valuable supplies to the main campaign. This mode can be played with any of the four heroes at your disposal and, amazingly, becomes more varied as you make progress in the campaign and unlock additional modules through various in-game feats. They\u2019ve even got unlockable perks to make your runs smoother, and asynchronous multiplayer via the ability to leave behind imprints of your character to either attack or assist other players in their own runs. This could honestly have been its own game, and I can see myself spending a lot of time shooting for a high score \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s thrown in here as a diversion is just nuts."

Or is simply more Hyrule to explore enough for you? Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to pick just one, because Nintendo\u2019s response to all of those answers is a casual but confident, \u201cSure thing.\u201d The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn\u2019t necessarily revolutionize what already made Breath of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time, but it\u2019s not a sequel that\u2019s simply more of the same, either. This sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious, with creative new systems like vehicle building, ridiculous weapon crafting, and a revamped Hyrule map with a dizzying amount of depth further fleshing out the intoxicating exploration that made the original so captivating. Breath of the Wild felt far from unfinished but, inconceivably, Tears of the Kingdom has somehow made it feel like a first draft. Before we dive too deep into Hyrule, a quick note about spoilers . I won\u2019t spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but these games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the first time you see one of BotW\u2019s dragons soaring overhead is around every corner here too, and the last thing I\u2019d want to do is steal the many moments that made my jaw literally drop from you. That said, there are some huge parts of Tears that are introduced fairly early on that I will be talking about because of how fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I am going to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like millions of others) you\u2019ve already decided you are going to play Tears, you should probably just go play it and then come back to share in the wonder with me later. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask What We Said About The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I\u2019ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I\u2019ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven\u2019t seen before. I\u2019ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments. - Jose Otero, March 2, 2017 Score: 10 Read the full The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review On top of that, you\u2019ll likely want to have played BotW to fully understand much of what I\u2019ll be discussing here \u2013 not to mention because it\u2019s an incredible game and you\u2019re depriving yourself by skipping it. Tears looks even smarter and more expansive when you know what came before it, but many of the recognizable basics shine just as brightly. Things that are as simple as being able to climb nearly any wall or glide as far as your expandable stamina will take you, or the concept of shrines acting as self-contained puzzle chambers you can solve to boost your abilities are things I don\u2019t have time to get into here simply because there\u2019s so much new to cover. I can safely say people who enjoyed BotW will almost certainly like Tears, partly because of just how similar these two games are. The initial structure is a very familiar one: you start in a masterfully crafted introductory area where you learn the ropes and get a new set of powerful abilities, then dive into the open world with a main quest marker that quickly splits into four . From there you are free to do whatever the heck you want. You can even march right to the finale of the campaign if you know where to look, though that\u2019s not quite as straightforward to attempt this time around (which is probably for the best, as I do not recommend it for anybody but the inevitable speedrunners, whom I proudly salute). The story stands out from your typical Zelda plots. \u201c The bulk of the cutscenes and big story moments are also once again collected at specific spots around the map , shedding light on the history of Hyrule and the source of the \u201cUpheaval\u201d \u2013 a bombastic event at the start of Tears that opens up menacing chasms, causes the ruins of an ancient civilization called the Zonai to appear floating in the sky, and peppers the surface with new structures and strange anomalies. This still might not be the best storytelling structure over the course of such a large game, as it leaves you without much direct interaction with its central characters for most of your time playing, but that\u2019s very easy to forgive when the story itself is so dang cool. Sure, it\u2019s about stopping some evil jerk (welcome back, Ganondorf ) and saving Princess Zelda as usual, but the direction that familiar shell is taken is buck wild at times in the best possible way. I\u2019m still a bit amazed Nintendo decided to go the way it did, and the freshness that surprise provides helps Tears stand out amongst your typical Zelda plots. It\u2019s not storytelling on the level of a game like God of War or anything, but it can be a legitimate high point instead of simply the entertaining background flavor it was mostly relegated to in BotW. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Trailer Images 19 Images Exploration is the lifeblood of the recent Zeldas, though, and doing so is still an absolute delight in Tears \u2013 especially when the new building system empowers you to slap together custom cars, boats, and flying machines that truly let you navigate its world however you want. BotW has influenced countless other games since its release in 2017, but one of the most important lessons that very few of them seemed to learn is that a blank map can be more powerful than a full one. There is an enormous amount of stuff to do and see, and if you were handed a checklist of waypoints to methodically clear off right away it could easily feel overwhelming rather than exciting. Instead, you are given the bare minimum you need to complete the main quest, a pile of pins, and a blank map just begging you to fill it in yourself. Marking down points of interest as you dive in from the sky, hearing rumors as you talk to townsfolk, or simply getting lost and stumbling by something interesting is so much more rewarding than following an arrow to your next destination. It comes from experience, but Nintendo has incredible confidence that we will seek out the map\u2019s secrets without being led directly to them \u2013 and if we don\u2019t see absolutely everything, that\u2019s okay. It makes the whole adventure feel so natural, so much less \u201cvideo gamey\u201d than you might expect, which is particularly important when Tears basically doubles the size of this world. This may be the same map, but it in no way feels repetitive. \u201c While this is the same fundamental map of Hyrule, it in no way feels repetitive to explore \u2013 even as someone who\u2019s scoured BotW for secrets. The story doesn\u2019t give you a hard number, but it\u2019s been a few years since the defeat of Calamity Ganon, and the people are rebuilding. The main town is a brand-new outpost that has sprung up in Hyrule Field just outside of the castle, giving you a hub that evolves in entertaining ways as you progress. It\u2019s a ton of fun to recognize characters or locations and see how they\u2019ve grown or changed, but even beyond those explicit differences, Tears simply sends you along unexpected paths and to unfamiliar locations. That made me constantly see parts of Hyrule I knew and loved from a different perspective, breathing plenty of life into a map that clearly still had more than enough to give. And if that\u2019s not enough for you, there are also more substantial changes. I\u2019ll leave many of the fine details for you to find on your own, but I will say that whole areas have been drastically altered by the Upheaval, causing unexpected weather anomalies or creating brand-new terrain for chests and shrines alike to hide in. The main quest has you marching toward many of those areas head-on, but there are also plenty of examples off the beaten path that I\u2019ve discovered across the more than 100 hours of playing (and I\u2019m sure there are many more I\u2019ve missed). For example, the beach town of Lurelin in the southeast didn\u2019t play a huge role in BotW, but almost immediately Tears tells you it\u2019s been attacked by pirates, putting both its rescue and its rebuilding in your hands. Did You Replay Breath of the Wild to Get Ready for Tears of the Kingdom? Yes, within the past month. Yes, within the past six months. No, not within the past six months. No, I've only played once. I've never played it. Answer See Results And if that\u2019s not enough for you, there are also dozens and dozens of caves, wells, and sky islands to explore. These are all largely self-contained little encounters to complete, ranging from hidden fairy fountains to expansive obstacle courses that put your cleverness and combat prowess to the test. I loved stumbling upon a new cave and fighting my way through winding halls full of monsters to find some hidden piece of armor at the end \u2013 or sometimes even a larger boss monster guarding a shrine. Meanwhile, looking up instead of down, using one of the new Skyview Towers to launch myself into the air let me easily find shrines on the surface before gliding to a nearby floating archipelago filled with its own challenges to take on. And if that\u2019s still not enough for you , then boy oh boy did I save the biggest for last \u2013 and let this also serve as a final warning that if you want to know nothing beyond what\u2019s been shown in trailers and previews, turn back now (granted, this part is revealed to you very shortly after the introductory area). Even with all of what I\u2019ve talked about so far, I can understand if someone might think Nintendo took a safe route by reusing the same (if altered) map, but it was when I dove down one of the angry, red chasms that dot the surface and into the Depths below that all my doubts melted into pure, joyous amazement. Rest assured that the generally small sky islands do not represent the entirety of the new area to explore, because waiting beneath is a dangerous, pitch-black map that is literally the size of Hyrule itself . It is massive. I have played over 100 hours of Tears and I have revealed maybe half of this wondrous new area. Any doubt melted into pure, joyous amazement when I dove down my first chasm. \u201c While roughly the same size as the surface, the Depths doesn\u2019t have as much in the way of side quests or story moments but is full of treasure chests to seek out and plenty of surprises worth discovering for yourself, many of which are brilliantly hidden in plain (if very dark) sight. It acts as Zelda\u2019s version of a \u201cpoison swamp\u201d-style nightmarescape, too, thanks to a red substance called Gloom that coats both its terrain and enemies. When you take damage from Gloom, your max health is decreased until you either return to the light or eat a Gloom-removing meal, adding an enjoyable mounting pressure to every fight. What do I mean by \u201creturn to the light?\u201d That\u2019s a whole different can of worms. The Depths is completely dark (like, Advanced Darkness dark), meaning you have to throw out collectable Brightbloom Seeds as you walk to see where you are going, which gives exploration a totally different and much tenser feel. There are no shrines in the Depths; instead, there are dozens of structures called Lightroots that heal your Gloom damage and illuminate a part of the map around them when activated, giving you another completionist goal that\u2019s equal parts compelling and extensive. Taken all together, the Depths and the sky islands act as brilliant complements to the more traditional surface activities, stretching a structure I was already intimately familiar with into beautiful settings and wild situations I very much wasn\u2019t. Whether it\u2019s lighting up the darkness below, flying a custom glider between floating rocks hundreds of meters up, or just seeing what\u2019s down at the bottom of some random well, there is so much to do in Tears that it\u2019s easy to spend hours upon hours completing tasks without ever once looking at your quest log. You might be heading to a point of interest only to get sidetracked by some cave worth exploring nearby or a citizen with a quest for you, and suddenly you\u2019re off getting hopelessly distracted by a delightfully spontaneous activity that\u2019s just as exciting. That was part of the magic of BotW too \u2013 as well as plenty of other great open-world games \u2013 but now there are uncountable opportunities to end up wildly far away from where you thought (almost always incorrectly) you were going. One time I was making my way toward a tower hoping to chart a new section of the map when I stumbled upon a friendly drummer in need of some honey, so I promptly switched priorities and headed toward a nearby forest in search of bees... and of course, it wasn\u2019t very long after that I was in the literal underworld being murdered by a giant robot as a result. I just wanted some honey. Nintendo had different plans for me, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of Breath of the Wild. \u201c In 2017, I had played just over 80 hours of BotW when I finally decided to beat the final boss, feeling content that I had done all of the side quests, shrine hunting, and other odds and ends that I wanted to do. Not quite all that existed, mind you, but definitely a significant majority and certainly all of what really tempted me. Similarly, I beat Tears\u2019 main questline around the 82-hour mark, but this time I feel like I have barely done half of all the things I still want to. Even more than 20 hours after that, I still have dozens of Lightroots to find, plenty of shrines left to complete, two maps marked up with loads of unexplored points of interest, a laundry list of side quests waiting for me, and so much more. I took my time playing through the main quest stuff, too , letting myself wander and get distracted as I so love to do. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of a predecessor that made me say that exact same thing. The in-game tracker tells me I\u2019ve barely passed 50%. Send help. So much of Tears feels like a direct response to BotW and what people have said about it since its release, a fact that can be seen clearly across its bolstered enemies and weapons, but perhaps most obviously in its dungeon design. The Divine Beasts got a lot of flack for bucking usual Zelda dungeon trends, and while their equivalent in Tears doesn\u2019t scratch that itch of collecting a compass, map, and key item like in older Zelda games either, they are at least a lot more thematically interesting and varied this time around. The tasks themselves aren\u2019t actually very different from the Divine Beasts, but their flavorful new context and the epic paths that generally lead up to them are a thrill, making them all far more entertaining than the rather restrictive insides of those ancient machines. Every IGN Zelda Review Score 23 Images The other huge improvement throughout all of Tears is the boss variety. No longer are you fighting four variations of the same Ganon-adjacent enemy; you\u2019re now facing unique and often wildly entertaining foes that can occasionally stand with the greats of the series. I don\u2019t want to give away too much about them, but a standout for me was certainly a gooped-up monster that felt like a Splatoon villain had somehow infiltrated Hyrule. New boss-like enemies abound all across this map, in fact, with the returning Hinox and Talus joined by leaping Frox and fearsome three-headed Gleeok. It\u2019s not just the bosses \u2013 enemy variety as a whole has been vastly improved, and it\u2019s elevated the still rather straightforward but extremely satisfying combat as a result. At the simplest level, Bokoblins can now carry baskets of throwable items or wear armor you have to break specifically with blunt weapons, but they can also be led by a huge Boss Bokoblin that coordinates their attacks. New Horriblins menacingly crawl along cave ceilings, Constructs can shoot rocket arrows at you, Like Likes will devour you whole, and Little Frox will scurry out to eat the Brightblooms you\u2019ve worked so hard to collect and plant in the Depths. It\u2019s a wide and impressive menagerie that can genuinely push you to play differently depending on what\u2019s in front of you. The weapon fusion just says, \u201cYes\u201d to whatever you throw at it. \u201c That\u2019s also true of the absolutely absurd new weapon fusion system, which lets you attach any item or object onto any other weapon, shield, and often even arrowhead. Monster horns now act as powerful blades or bludgeons to buff your base weapons, letting you do sweet things like replace the blade of a rusty sword with the katana-like saber of a Blue Lizalfos horn. You can also do extremely dumb stuff, like put a bomb on the end of a stick to blow both you and your enemies up the moment you jab them with it, or put a minecart on a spear because\u2026 I don\u2019t know, why not? It\u2019s a system that just says, \u201cYes\u201d to whatever you throw at it, and then trusts you to figure out what\u2019s good, bad, or incredibly funny. Even though the somewhat controversial weapon durability system is back, so you should prepare for the heartbreak of your favorite sword shattering in your hands all over again, it\u2019s been totally recontextualized by this new fusion system. Suddenly, you can essentially farm strong weapons simply by killing powerful enemies, because having a bag full of monster parts is the equivalent of having dozens of backup weapons just waiting for a handle to be attached to. You won\u2019t find fire swords just lying around anymore \u2013 you have to make them, and any base sword will do fine if you\u2019ve got the horn of a fire dragon to slap onto it.

(Or I would just stick a stick on a stick so I could poke an enemy from twice as far away, whatever sticks for you!) Tears adds additional nuance to combat by giving you even more options to explore, too. Throwing items are now a key part of every encounter, letting you hurl everything from bombs (which are now an explosively powerful consumable item rather than a weaker but infinitely reusable ability) to special plants \u2013 like the excellent Muddle Bud that makes enemies attack each other, or the Dazzlefruit that causes them to drop their weapons. These items can be attached to arrowheads for the same effect from afar, and shields can even have objects like flame or ice throwers slapped onto them to transform them from a defensive option to an offhand weapon. The controls for throwing and attaching arrowheads started out a little tricky, since you have to select the items you want to use one at a time, but once I got the hang of it I found it to be a super-intuitive system that let me pull off cool mid-fight maneuvers I would never be able to do in BotW. The building tools walk the line of powerful but approachable extremely well. \u201c The complementary ability to weapon fusion is the boundlessly creative Ultra Hand building system. Essentially, BotW\u2019s Magnesis power got a huge upgrade that now lets you pick up, rotate, and attach almost any object to another with ease. This is supported by dozens of special objects, called Zonai Devices, that you can pull out of your inventory at any time, giving you immense freedom in how you navigate the world around you. It\u2019s amazing how often I would take a Zonai glider and a few fans out of my pocket to build a makeshift airplane and fly somewhere extremely far away extremely fast, and I loved experimenting with powered wheels to make cars that could take me from town to town faster than any horse. Your creations can even be effective in combat, with one Zonai device acting as a Roomba-like base that automatically drives toward enemies, waiting to be loaded up with whatever instruments of doom you can concoct.

Why climb that cliff when you can just strap a hot air balloon to a log and ride it up? Why swim across that river when you could quickly assemble a speedboat instead? One time I was driving a little car I\u2019d built, only to reach a dead-end mountain next to a deep valley \u2013 but instead of abandoning my creation to climb over, I channeled my inner Doc Brown and turned it into a flying car that was able to hover around the mountain instead. Did Nintendo mean for me to go that way? I have no idea. I didn\u2019t earn anything for it, but that simple act might still be one of the most rewarding gaming moments I\u2019ve had in a long time. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I was supposed to do that, but it worked\u201d sort of feels like the unofficial slogan of BotW to me, and Tears leans even harder into that creativity. These building tools are woven into every part of Tears, with most of its shrine challenges asking you to make use of them in inventive or inspiring ways. However, this isn\u2019t The Legend of Zelda: Nuts & Bolts . That is to say, this system doesn\u2019t warp Tears into something unrecognizably about building. In almost every scenario where a contraption would be the best or \u201cintended\u201d way to do something, you\u2019ll find the pieces for a simple creation sitting nearby. There\u2019s also an Autobuild ability that lets you save designs and hunt down schematics for developer-designed creations. That means Tears provides shortcuts if you aren\u2019t really interested in this side of it while simultaneously empowering those of us who are to essentially play Kerbal Space Program within The Legend of Zelda. I had tons of fun using these tools to find solutions to the problems put in front of me. A highlight is a recurring character who needs help holding up a sign at dozens of different locations around Hyrule, asking you to use nearby resources to prop it up in progressively more ridiculous situations. Getting from point A to point B can become an engaging puzzle all its own, whether that\u2019s building a contraption to help get a Korok (yes, this world is once again full of them) to his far-off friend, or making a traveling band\u2019s carriage fly to get them up a mountain side. Amidst all this cleverness there\u2019s also a hysterical air of Looney Tunes lunacy, letting you strap literal rockets to anything and everything and then watch like Wile E. Coyote as your plans disastrously blow up in your face or simply drive off out of control. Sometimes failure is just as amusing as success. It's clear Nintendo was listening to feedback after BotW. \u201c Your other two new abilities take a less prominent role, but they support the additions made elsewhere nicely. You can reverse time on objects with Recall, which is largely used either to ride rocks that have fallen from sky islands back up where they came from or to send an enemy attacks back at them in neat ways, while Ascend lets you warp through the ceiling up to whatever is above you. Given all of the caves in Tears, the ability to quickly get above ground again or climb certain mountains faster is essential, and it can even be used to find all manner of sneaky secrets. It took my brain some time to remember I even had this power, but once I started \u201cthinking with portals\u201d it became one of my favorite tools. Neither of these abilities are quite as exciting as Ultra Hand or Fuse, necessarily, but it\u2019s notable that I never once mourned the loss of Stasis or Cryonis, which are completely gone since Link no longer has the Sheikah Slate from BotW. There are also a million and a half little quality-of-life improvements that make it even harder to go back to BotW after Tears. That includes super-simple things like the fact that you are now given the option to drop a weapon, shield, or bow right away when you open a chest with a full inventory rather than having to back out first, open the menu, drop the thing, and open the chest again. But there are also more involved changes, like finally having a convenient recipe list that saves every meal and elixir you\u2019ve ever made or found, which I actually specifically said would be a great addition just a couple of weeks ago. I couldn\u2019t even begin to round up all the little bits and bobs like this, and it signals loudly that Nintendo was listening to feedback, even if it didn\u2019t always make drastic changes in response. (Click here to vote in our Legend of Zelda Face-Off!) One place Tears hasn\u2019t necessarily improved over BotW, however, is performance. This can be a beautiful game, especially when flying high above its gorgeous landscapes with a consistently incredible soundtrack in the background, but the reality is that even when running in docked mode it\u2019s still at 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second, at best. Obviously, that does not technically compare to what games on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC can do. However, unless you value resolution and frame rate above absolutely everything, including gameplay, that\u2019s not really the point. The majority of the time Tears runs just fine, but the frame rate will take noticeable dives any time there are too many effects on screen at once. It didn\u2019t feel any worse than the same exact issues in BotW, though it is a little more noticeable in the simple but charming new raids you can do against enemy camps with a group of NPC monster hunters. I also infrequently noticed things could briefly freeze while diving down quickly from the sky (the same sort of freeze BotW speedrunners see when zipping across Hyrule a little too fast). The frame rate still dips sometimes, but I saw essentially no bugs in over 100 hours. \u201c But on the whole, just as before, these issues rarely interrupt the action in a truly detrimental way. The frame rate dips can certainly be distracting at times, but the only harm they really cause is the emotional damage of making me once again pine for a Switch Pro, as we\u2019ve all been doing for the past several years. Would it look nicer on a more powerful, more modern system? Definitely, and I hope Nintendo makes one before too long. But does that mean I am going to touch my PS5 or Xbox again until I\u2019ve finished exploring this new version of Hyrule? Not a chance. It\u2019s also really quite remarkable that I saw essentially no bugs across more than 100 hours of game time, positioning it far away from a mess like last year\u2019s Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or plenty of other recent games on other platforms. Frankly, the fact that you can jump from the very top of the sky and dive all the way to the surface, straight through a chasm, and down to the floor of the Depths seamlessly, with zero load screens, on a Switch made in 2017 feels like a miracle, and that makes overlooking the handful of moments I saw it hang for a second or two while doing so incredibly easy."

        "Content": "Undaunted: Normandy came out of nowhere in 2019 and became enough of a hit to spawn a sequel and an expansion. As you can guess from the title, it\u2019s another board game in a very long list of games about the battles in northern France during World War II. What made Undaunted different was the way it represented soldiers and officers using a deck of cards that players could add to during the game to tweak their strategy. It was so good we put it on our best deck-building games and best war board games lists. Undaunted: Stalingrad 0 $120.00  save 10% $108.00 at Amazon IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask With Undaunted: Stalingrad, the designers have moved the action to Eastern Front, but this isn\u2019t just a reskin. It\u2019s a whole new game with a novel, dedicated campaign system. What\u2019s in the Box Undaunted: Stalingrad comes in a big, heavy box with a big, heavy price tag. There are two colossal stacks of cardboard tiles that are used to build the city-scapes the 2-players will fight over during the course of the campaign. In fact, if you lay out all the tiles in rows and number order, it\u2019ll make a rough map of the historical city. One set of tiles is for the starting situation of the map. The other is a set of replacements for those tiles if the originals get destroyed or fortified as part of the action. It\u2019s a similar story for the decks of cards that make up the remainder of the weight. There\u2019s one lot for the German player and another for the Soviets. The starting decks are functionally identical. But as play goes on, your deck will suffer permanent casualties as well as expand with new options. These additions are not the same for both sides but represent operational and material differences between them, addressing a common critique of the original game. This isn\u2019t just a reskin. It\u2019s a whole new game with a novel, dedicated campaign system. \u201c Some 10-sided dice and sheets of punch-out counters representing different squads, vehicles and scenery as well as battlefield markers round out the contents. The slightly cartoonish style used in the cards and tiles across the Undaunted games is a bit of an acquired taste given the serious subject matter. But for this fourth outing, artist Roland MacDonald has nailed the balance of realism and caricature required. It\u2019s also good to see some realistic diversity among the Soviet forces, including women and various ethnic backgrounds. Rules and How it Plays Deck-building, where players start with a core of cards and use them to buy additional cards during the game, is a well-worn design concept. However, in most deck-building games the deck-building is the entire point. What sets Undaunted apart is the way that the designers make the deck stand in for aspects of morale and unit cohesion without any additional rules overhead. There is, of course, a decent luck factor in the card draw that may, or may not, support what you need to do on the board. But there\u2019s plenty of strategy , too. Players start each turn with four cards: they play one in a nerve-wracking bid to see who will go first, and the other three on their turn. Most cards represent battlefield units and allow the player to take an action with the corresponding counter on the board, such as moving, or shooting, which is resolved via a d10 roll. On a hit, a corresponding card is removed from the deck. So the more units come under fire, the less likely they are to act and the less reliable they become, simply because their cards are less likely to get drawn. Decks also include non-commissioned officer cards. These don\u2019t activate units but add cards to your deck or draw more cards from it. This corresponds to pep talks, courageous leadership and using reinforcements to patch up ailing forces. But try to coordinate too many different units and you'll find your key cards won\u2019t turn up in the confusion. The final type of card is Fog of War which does nothing but clog up your hand. These represent battlefield uncertainty and are gained when you scout out new tiles, a prerequisite for moving. Adding to your deck and taking actions on the board are your levers in trying to meet the scenario objectives. These are far more diverse than previous Undaunted games, which were mostly a race to control specific victory tiles. That\u2019s still a thing here but it\u2019s complemented by frantic timed defenses and desperate demolitions, helped by a wider range of tiles with simple scenery rules. There are even scenarios with secret intelligence that you don\u2019t reveal to your opponent until triggered. This variety means there are multiple ways to approach each battle, with subtleties of strategy that you might not tease out until it\u2019s too late. You\u2019ll also need to change your plans on the fly in response to the dynamic situation on the ground. It\u2019s a system that forces you into endless awkward compromises. Riflemen, for example, are the only cards that can control tiles. But unless you have multiple matching cards you can\u2019t both move and take control in the same turn. Instead, you have to risk them creeping forward, closing range and making them an easier target while allowing the enemy the chance to move up and contest the tile themselves. Most units have special actions, like engineers launching smoke or machine gunners laying suppressing fire, that you\u2019ll have to balance with the need to move, shoot, and complete objectives. It\u2019s an ongoing, fraught series of tough trade-offs. Scenarios get teed up according to a branching structure that depends on who won the previous battle. Each side has a scenario book with the setup and a brief narrative introduction to the next fight. Many scenarios make new cards available to your deck, from off-map assets like bombers to on-map tanks. Victory always wins you something, maybe it\u2019s control of a section of the city or an extra promotion. Depending on how things unfold, the campaign can come to a sudden end -- or it can culminate in a colossal battle for final dominance over the city. However, the loser in a scenario often gets a slight starting advantage in the setup for the next one, helping to keep things even. The campaign can come to a sudden end -- or it can culminate in a colossal battle for final dominance over the city \u201c As a result, Undaunted: Stalingrad encourages you to think long-term. At the end of each fight, you take casualties depending on how many cards you lost. If these turn out to be line soldiers, they\u2019re replaced with inferior reserve cards, while specialists like snipers or engineers are lost permanently. You also promote two cards, which get swapped for superior alternatives. So it\u2019s no longer a case of sending in the troops, gung-ho to secure objectives. Every decision is a compromise where taking a risk might pay off with a win but hobble your deck for the remainder of the campaign. This adds a brilliant frisson of danger to even simple choices and makes conceding a strategic decision rather than a cop-out. The scheme of swapping out cards or tiles for replacements means you pay for a lot of stuff in the box that you won\u2019t use. But it also forms the basis of a superb campaign system. Ongoing campaigns are tricky things because as one side ekes out an advantage it tends to snowball. Between the balance changes in scenario setup and the regular, vicious grind of attrition that both sides suffer, this is unlikely to happen here. At the same time, the constant churn of components and the risk of a sudden victory keep you feeling like every battle matters. And the way the city and your forces disintegrate around you packs an increasingly potent emotional punch as the campaign goes on. When you\u2019re done it\u2019s easy to reset the game ready to do it again, with a high likelihood you\u2019ll see different scenarios.

        "Title": "Undertale Review",
        "Score": 10.0,
        "id": "88a10b2770355434916a125f9f80acdc",
        "Content": "Update: Undertale is now available for Nintendo Switch. The game is identical visually and content-wise, except for some minor tweaks over the 2017 PlayStation 4 release (and the original 2015 Windows/OSX version). Most notably, the Switch version adds a new miniboss encounter not found in the previous versions. Our original review from August 15, 2017 follows.  Note: the review contains some small spoilers for Undertale.  I finished my first playthrough of Undertale in stunned silence. My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That\u2019s kind of Undertale\u2019s specialty \u2014 playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.  As a lone human fallen into an underground world that serves as a prison for monsters, I had my journey laid out for me, as most RPG protagonists do. For my first playthrough I took a pacifist approach, being as kind and merciful as possible as I searched for a way back to the surface. But I made a mistake: I accidentally killed a monster in the beginning. So I restarted without saving, as I would in any other game when I needed a do-over. Except\u2026 things were different this time. Dialogue had changed to reflect that I\u2019d seen her die. Then Flowey, Undertale\u2019s chaotic evil, fourth wall-breaking flower, tore into me for having the gall to abuse the power of the save state.  Gaming the System  Undertale expected me to have played RPGs before and played with those conventions in unexpected ways. That first berating from Flowey shaped the rest of my experience \u2014 I learned I couldn\u2019t bank on a soft reset, so I had to tread carefully. Everything I did mattered. That clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn\u2019t have been told in any other way or medium. Undertale has to be a game, and that\u2019s the key to its brilliance.  Its dodging-based combat minigames especially rely on that concept. Boss battles consistently subverted my expectations, even after I thought I\u2019d figured everything out, but even run-of-the-mill random encounters are closely intertwined with storytelling and worldbuilding. Every enemy has a unique personality expressed both through combat and non-combative options. In my pacifist run I ended up talking to a lot of monsters, giving out hugs, and even (and especially) flirting with them to avoid killing them. In order to spare a monster that wanted to flirt but didn\u2019t want to admit it, I had to \u201cget close but not too close.\u201d That option changed the rules of combat so that I had to narrowly dodge incoming projectiles\u2026 until the monster blushed so much that it stopped fighting. Undertale has to be a game, and that\u2019s the key to its brilliance. \u201c  There are tons of jokes that appeal to internet nerds, and I often felt like Undertale was talking directly to me, like it knew what I was thinking. An anime-loving character\u2019s \u201cselfie,\u201d for example, is actually a picture of a garbage can with pink sparkle filters over it (and speaking from experience, this is very accurate). I especially love Undertale\u2019s humor when it has something to say, however subtle. I entered a snail race (called Thundersnail) and was told to press Z repeatedly to encourage my snail to win. I spammed Z until she burst into flames, and the Thundersnail organizer told me that \u201call that pressure to succeed really got to her.\u201d It was, like many of Undertale\u2019s one-off jokes, extremely relatable \u2014 and knowing and predicting its audience is one of Undertale\u2019s biggest strengths.  Monsters Are People Too  Undertale\u2019s writing is consistently funny, but it can also be touching. Small, semi-hidden notes and dialogue enrich the world and build on an already compelling story of humanity and morality. A favorite was a series of \u201cecho flowers\u201d in a beautiful, ethereal hallway that repeated snippets of an overhead conversation. A monster didn\u2019t want to share her greatest wish \u2014 that one day she would climb the mountain that traps all the monsters underground and look out at the world \u2014 for fear of being laughed at, and although her friend promised they wouldn\u2019t, the friend ended up laughing anyway. It was silly, until the last flower repeated: \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just funny\u2026 That\u2019s my wish too.\u201d  Experiencing the depth of the monsters\u2019 hopes and dreams is crucial to Undertale\u2019s exploration of morality, personhood, and conflict. Different monsters talk about each other in front of you, so once I met them I got to discover who they actually were, as opposed to what their reputations suggested. Most of the main characters are also very well developed with consistent personalities across different dialogue and story routes. It made it hard for me to summon the aggression to attack any of them \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely the point. When I was trying to go for a more violent run, fighting monsters I\u2019d once flirted with made Undertale\u2019s message about humanity hit even harder.  Determination  Some fights can be frustrating or even tedious, however, at least at first. In a violent playthrough, I had to grind quite a bit to meet certain story requirements and grew tired of it after a while. Fighting enemy after enemy replaced the puzzles in the peaceful runs, however, and the tradeoff felt very balanced and ultimately meaningful to the story. I also found myself trudging back through areas I had already cleared just so I could beat a boss or get an item, and while it was absolutely worth it in the end, I wasn't terribly excited to do it. At one point I had run out of gold and needed to buy healing items, and the only shop that would buy items off of me was about a 10 minute walk away. (The other shopkeepers don't buy items because they don't want your trash.)  That said, I don't regret any of the extra time I spent walking around, because I got to find things like Thundersnail and the echo flowers. It's the little details that make Undertale so special, and I wanted to see them all. Every one of them feels deliberate \u2014 long sections of dialogue at the beginning and certain fights can be slow, but they are necessary for establishing the characters in a way that only games can do. In a different run, underwhelming boss battles turn mournful because of what one-hit KOs imply in the world. It was Undertale's ongoing, well-woven theme of determination that kept me playing and replaying. Even though the art isn't always pretty \u2014 it's often ugly, even \u2014 Undertale is an incredibly expressive game from start to finish, making up for visual limitations with excellent music and charming animations. It's also gender- and sexuality-inclusive in a very real, noticeable way. Every small detail reveals an intimate understanding of its audience, and that is essential to what makes Undertale\u2019s commentary on personhood so effective. Playstation 4 Review, August 15 2017 By Brendan Graeber After playing through Undertale on PS4, I\u2019m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more). The only real additions I spotted are on the periphery, like being able to set a background to the centered 4:3 ratio screen, and the dynamically changing art is a nice touch. You can also choose to navigate both the world and in combat using either analogue stick or D-pad. Both work well, but the sensitivity of the stick in certain fights had me preferring the buttons to the stick."

        "Content": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u2019s sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild\u2019s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I\u2019ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I\u2019m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in. The untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I\u2019ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don\u2019t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you\u2019d expect. It all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I\u2019ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain. It\u2019s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play. What elevates Breath of Wild above its contemporaries is its sheer freedom.But what elevates Breath of Wild above its open-world contemporaries is its sheer freedom, both in its non-linear questing structure and in your ability to climb almost any surface and travel in any direction once you leave the starting area. It is the heart of what makes this action-adventure game truly special and addictive. Like many open-world games it delivers on the implied promise that if you can see it out in the distance, chances are you can eventually reach it \u2013 but here, figuring out how to get there is more often than not a satisfying puzzle in itself, and one that never gets old. For instance, a tantalizing island far off the coast of the mainland was just out of my paragliding reach for the first several hours until after I\u2019d upgraded my abilities. When I finally did, what took place when I finally reached my objective was a great twist that blew my mind \u2013 including finding an easier alternate route I\u2019d missed. That paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile. You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas, and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next. Every IGN Zelda Review Score 23 Images ] From overhead you get a glimpse of what\u2019s even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology, and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them. It doesn\u2019t matter, for example, if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you\u2019ll freeze to death before you hit the ground. Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference. title=More%20Nintendo%20Switch%20Reviews&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=switch-reviews&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article As you continue to improve Link\u2019s stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations. But no matter how much stronger you get, the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be. Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces, and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you\u2019re wearing any metal. Additionally, the day/night cycle is constantly running, and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground, it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants, and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself. These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself. Yet there are still pockets of serenity and beauty spread throughout the gorgeous, tantalizing landscape. In these moments, subtle music queues matched the tempo of my adventure, swaying between playful piano melodies and ambient sounds of wildlife. In the foreground, Breath of the Wild\u2019s anime-inspired art style is colorful, remarkably lively, and beautifully animated, but it comes at the cost of brief framerate hiccups and object pop-in that\u2019s most noticeable when you\u2019re playing the Switch in TV mode, where it renders at 900p, and when there are a lot of physics particle effects flying around the screen. The issues are less frequent playing on in portable mode on the 720p screen, but regardless of where I played the performance problems never significantly soured my gameplay. Performance on the Wii U version is roughly the same as the Switch, although it's important to note it renders at 720p. This makes the jaggies a little more visible and lighting appear slightly different. Otherwise, it looks good on Wii U. label=Extreme%20Chef The light and flexible cooking system offers lots of opportunity to experiment.Unlike a lot of survival games in which every item you use must be created from felled trees and dug-up minerals, Breath of the Wild focuses all its crafting systems on cooking. It\u2019s a light and flexible system that offers lots of opportunity for experimenting with different ingredient combinations to help you survive. Raw food and quick-and-dirty snacks cooked by a fire will replenish a small amount of health, but the most interesting and stat-boosting dishes come from tossing ingredients into a pot to make a hearty meal. I\u2019ve spent many hours figuring out the best recipes by using clues noted in the ingredient descriptions to come up with effects like stamina boosts and elemental resistances of various potencies, and I loved that whenever I got a little carried away with the my recipes I ended up with a censored-out dish appropriately called Dubious Food that\u2019s apparently too disgusting to even look at. Making buff-imbuing potions is equally as flexible, and you\u2019ll find plenty of bugs and monster parts with which to mix up a special brew. The art of cooking is a relatively small feature, but like Breath of the Wild\u2019s other components, every piece of this sandbox feels meticulously thought out, and almost every action has a natural consequence that makes sense. label=Just%20the%20Right%20Tools Breath of the Wild\u2019s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep, but you\u2019ll need to study its nuances if you want to survive in the late game. Link can still use swords, spears, and axes (as well as other amusing blunt objects) he finds in the world, but for the first time in the Zelda series they\u2019ll wear down and eventually break from use, which fits perfectly with the survival angle. Especially in the early game, when most item durability is low, you\u2019re constantly swapping out weapons, never getting too attached to one sword or hammer and always ready to improvise by, say, picking up a bony limb of a downed Stal Bokoblin and using it to finish off the last of a group of enemies. Breath of the Wild\u2019s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep.But no matter how prepared you think you are, you can still run into large Moblins and other enemies that can slay you in one hit. Naturally, as you make progress in the main quest you\u2019ll gain access to empowering special abilities that will improve your chances to survive, but to say more about them would be spoiler territory. I like that Nintendo allows you to switch certain items off and continue using the most basic tools if you feel these they\u2019re too powerful, creating an informal hardcore mode. Archery plays a much bigger role in combat this time around, and it\u2019s for the better. Link can quickly pull out his bow and take aim at enemies at any time, using a wide range of arrow types (like ice and fire) to take advantage of their weaknesses. The metallic ping you hear whenever you land a headshot is an immediately satisfying treat, as are the slow-motion attacks initiated by jumping off of high places and drawing your bow as you fall toward a batch of enemies below. Since the duration of this arrow-time effect is dictated by your stamina, early on it feels like you rarely have a huge advantage. A few stamina upgrades will buy you more time, but the stronger enemies you\u2019ll face on the outer fringes of Hyrule can usually withstand several headshots, which brings it back into balance. The way you can work the glider into combat is equally impressive and it makes for some engagingly versatile, skill-based action. Link can glide in, let go of the glider, and go into slow motion to fire off a few headshots, then grab hold of the glider again only to fall and downward-stab another unsuspecting enemy. The combat is open enough that it inspires more of the same playful experimentation as the world itself. Breath of the Wild tosses difficult encounters at you early on.Tense boss fights against larger foes are still a major highlight of the Zelda series, and Breath of the Wild tosses up more difficult encounters at you pretty early on, such as the imposing rock monster named Steppe Talus who will come right out of the ground. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always run away and come back to them later, and these emergent challenges add another welcome layer of danger to the survival sandbox. And you\u2019ll find plenty more optional bosses well-hidden in this massive world. On the other hand, dungeon bosses are challenging face-offs you can\u2019t run away from. They\u2019re as big on spectacle as ever, and my favorite ones involve ingenious combat puzzles where you need to use your Shekiah Slate, a powerful tool given to you early on that gives you special abilities like magnetising metal objects or creating bombs, to weaken the boss before you can take it down. label=Puzzling%20Mementos The Sheikah Slate is a major piece of the main quest, which puts Link on a journey to reclaim his memories of Princess Zelda after an apocalyptic event left Hyrule in ruins. It took me roughly 40 hours to slay the final boss and piece together what happened 100 years ago. While most Zelda games are rooted in heavy tradition, this coming-of-age story is anything but and has plenty of charming characters and surprises to reveal. It\u2019s amazing that it works so well while letting you tackle its dungeons in any order you want. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues.Hundreds of NPCs waiting to send you on side quests and puzzle shrines pepper the landscape, and there\u2019s even more to discover hidden behind vague clues. The fetch-questy ones aren\u2019t as interesting as the bonafide rabbit holes of The Witcher 3, but they still introduce you to interesting characters and dole out helpful info, meals, and materials. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues: in one example, a wandering minstrel sang a mysterious song that dropped hints as to the location of a special shrine. Some don\u2019t even show up as quests in your log, so you have to pay attention. Puzzle shrines yield their own useful rewards in the form of materials and handy weapon upgrades. These shrines involve short, inventive puzzle rooms which present you with a few clues and leave your to experiment in order to solve them. There\u2019s a wide variety of them and a majority are excellent little puzzles to figure out, but a few of the combat-focused challenges are repeated and another handful use motion controls that just don\u2019t feel quite as sharp enough due to wonky physics. Motion controls don't feel quite as sharp.Still, the techniques you learn from Shrines become essential training for Breath of the Wild\u2019s fantastic dungeons. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but these daunting, massive logic puzzles demand that you look at all the moving pieces in order to solve them. But every time I came across a new Shrine I was excited to uncover whatever new challenge it contained, with some Shrines in particular feeling as intricate as early levels in Portal, because they hinted at something much bigger and more impressive to come. There are even more cryptic challenges throughout Hyrule, some hidden behind riddles, and others are large mazes or other inventive ideas. Even after 50 hours, I still can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen almost everything, but the surprises keep on coming. I estimate it would take over 100 hours to solve every side quest, puzzle, and collectible. It is a truly massive game to tackle.

        "Content": "Update: The Witness has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .  The Witness is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries that sunk into my subconscious, tracing snaking paths across my brain until I was literally seeing mazes every time I closed my eyes. That\u2019s the kind of power The Witness has. It hooked me in with its masterful puzzle design and gorgeous visuals, then compelled me forward as I began to carve out my own purpose on the island. It\u2019s a freedom granted by a world as welcomingly open to exploration as it is enjoyably challenging to solve.   The Witness is a fully 3D world navigated in first person, but revolves around solving two-dimensional mazes found on in-game panels, completed by drawing the correct path from a circular start point to a rounded end point. This simple, intuitive core concept burns at the center of the 700 or so puzzles you\u2019ll find on The Witness\u2019s enigmatic island setting. Tracing lines feels as smooth as cutting butter with both a mouse and a gamepad and is accompanied by a warm, electric buzzing effect. The pure tactile joy of communicating with these interfaces and the initial sense of wonder and mystery their very presence brings were enough to motivate me in the earliest moments of The Witness. But these light-up labyrinths quickly became more sophisticated, adding new rules and constraints to the basic maze-like structure and thus allowing for the real tough, yet fulfilling challenges to emerge.  Puzzles With a Purpose  Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but fair. \u201c As I learned to apply each new rule, curiosity soon gave way to obsessive levels of motivation and purpose. I wasn\u2019t just solving puzzles because they were fun \u2013 slowly but surely, they were beginning to make sense in a much larger context. This manifests most tangibly in The Witness\u2019s first obvious, overarching \u201cgoal\u201d \u2013 shooting beams of light into a mountain. The mountain serves as the island\u2019s highest point, most prominent landmark, and consequently its most central mystery for reasons that are obvious once you start playing, but which I won\u2019t spoil here.  Most of the major regions on the island house machinery capable of shooting light into the mountain, but can only be activated once you solve the right sequence of puzzles, bestowing my frantic line-drawing antics with an important sense of progress. It also helped me see the various regions of the island as distinct parts of a larger, cohesive whole, making the constant treks across the surprisingly large, dense land mass less daunting because of it. It let me set my own goals, trace my own path around the island, so I never had to feel lost, physically or in terms of my role on the island. A map of the island.  There was also enough to do and see beyond the key objectives that my time spent simply wandering still felt compelling minute to minute. I could take a peaceful boat ride around the perimeter, explore the ruins of a wrecked ship, finally make the descent into that hidden underground passage I\u2019d discovered on a previous errand. I valued these quiet moments on the island as much as I did overcoming its most perplexing puzzles, especially during the times I felt truly stuck.  A New Perspective  Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but they\u2019re always fair and solvable. In a manner more freeing than most puzzle adventures, you\u2019re allowed and even encouraged to walk away from a problem you don\u2019t feel equipped to solve. That\u2019s a concept introduced in the opening minutes, when you encounter a locked door covered in symbols you\u2019re unfamiliar with. The answers you need are further up the path, but you have to let yourself walk away first to know that. The Witness does more than equip you with the tools needed to find the right answers \u2013 it teaches you how to ask the right questions.   Expand this dynamic to the whole of the island, and you get an intelligently designed puzzle game that doesn\u2019t just give you the freedom to chip away at its riddles at your own pace, but creates a compelling adventure of the learning process itself.  I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it. \u201c The masterful design of The Witness\u2019s puzzles is matched by the beautiful and clever layout of the island itself. One early sequence of puzzles unlocks a small courtyard full of sketches and diagrams of human hearts and veins. It didn\u2019t seem of immediate significance when I found it, until I walked out to the neighboring cliffside I had passed by on my way there and noticed the way the red tree roots growing along the edges of the seaside bluff looked like bright, thick arteries coursing through the flesh of the earth. These startling and sometimes enlightening visual revelations were everywhere, adding excitement and meaning to the world even when I wasn\u2019t actively seeking it out. Sights become symbolic with the right context.  Every tree, every rock, feels like it has been placed with a purpose, allowing familiar sights to take on thematic weight when viewed from different angles. Ordinary landmarks became focal points when framed with precise deliberation between a grove of trees, or perfectly centered inside a hollow window frame. That\u2019s kind of what The Witness is about: pointing you toward new ways of seeing.  Many times, finding the answer meant stepping away from the actual puzzle and asking myself what I wasn\u2019t seeing. Puzzles in The Witness are solved on these panels, but it doesn't mean everything you need to solve them exists within their physical confines. No matter what question a particular puzzle posed, I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it.   Island of Enlightenment  A lot of games try to be about things, but The Witness actually embodies those things. Audio logs hidden around the island contain quotes from famous philosophers and scientists, chosen with obvious care for the way each speaks to specific concepts The Witness sets out to explore. The graceful design of the island had already managed to provoke natural epiphanies about ideas some of the quotes address, so at times the logs felt unnecessary. But then other times the words spoke to me, in the same way the physical island had: an invitation to see things from a new point of view that maybe I hadn\u2019t considered. The view from the top.  Some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight... \u201c One particular quote at the top of the mountain comes from former astronaut Russell Schweickart. As I looked down at the island from its highest point, I felt a connection between what Schweickart was describing , when he spoke about the transformative effect of looking down at the Earth from space, and the all-encompassing view of the island the mountain afforded me. Like the Earth that Schweickart describes, spinning around the same way every day, revealing the same places with each rotation, nothing about the island ever really changes. I could walk by the same thing in The Witness ninety-nine times and never have a second thought, but then on the 100th passing, I'd notice something new about it. But not because the thing itself had changed \u2013 because I had.  Like everything else in The Witness, finding more concrete answers about this abandoned island and the people who once occupied it requires patience. There\u2019s plenty there to dissect \u2013 statues that seem like people frozen from various eras, mysterious corporate logos, hidden audio logs \u2013 and it was all enough to keep me enthralled in the mysteries it built across my 40- to 50-hour playthrough. Most of the time it\u2019s more questions than answers, and I enjoyed that it left things open to interpretation. Statues around the island seem like people from all eras, frozen in time.  There\u2019s also a lot you can miss \u2013 secrets tucked away behind the island\u2019s most challenging obstacles \u2013 but some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight, making every return to the island a new adventure. I estimate it would take 80 to 100 hours to fully do and see everything here, but there\u2019s a satisfying amount of thematic weight and contextual clues that I was able to reach the ending the first time without feeling like The Witness owed me a greater answer to its riddles. Story doesn\u2019t drive The Witness as much as its mystery, nor does it treat story as an arbitrary reward for your efforts; what\u2019s there only enriches an already fulfilling experience."

        "Content": "If, like me, you were waiting for more things to accomplish as John Marston, you shouldn't hesitate to pick up Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare . Rockstar's latest downloadable content for Red Dead is very obviously a love letter to B-movie horror flicks with a touch of fantasy added for good measure. It's unapologetically campy, and that is what makes it so special. Whereas Red Dead Redemption was a serious story in a serious landscape during serious times, Undead Nightmare twists the formerly grave game into something much more lighthearted. With all new cutscenes (the intro is truly epic), voice work from the original actors, creepier landscapes to explore complete with zombified animals, and a whole new soundtrack, it's clear that Rockstar put a lot of work into making this a complete, high-end production. The nightmare begins when John and his family are having a peaceful evening together at their ranch at Beecher's Hope. It's a dark and stormy night, and all of a sudden regular folks are transforming into flesh-eating monsters. Relatives rise from the grave only to grab a bite out of their loved ones, and best friends quickly turn into bitter enemies due to fear. Luckily, John Marston is around and he's not going to stand for such a dire situation. Now, before you head into the undead-infested wilds by your lonesome, keep in mind that general zombie survival rules apply: 1) Zombies are jerks that want to nom on your tasty brains, so don't trust them. 2) Always aim for the head. 3) If its head hasn't exploded, it's probably still coming to eat you. 4) Stay away from hordes. 5) Zombies can't climb ladders, so get up high for a better chance of survival. Killing zombies is really fun -- I imagine that's why they're commonly cast in videogames and horror flicks. To make it more enjoyable, you'll have some new weapons at your disposal: holy water, undead bait, and the ever-awesome blunderbuss. Using leftover zombie body parts as ammo, the blunderbuss will literally evaporate anything that is stupid enough to wander down your sights. Sweet. Using these new tools you can mix up your strategy when fighting off waves of brain-eaters -- bait and bomb them or just pull off a series of head shots using Dead Eye. There are also new close-up kill animations that are pretty cool and can help get you out of tough spots. Now, not all undead are created equal. In fact, a few of the zombies in Undead Nightmare look like they shuffled on over from a popular zombie shooter. The normal walkers -- slow from far away but will start running once they catch a whiff of your scent -- are obviously the most common. There are also big fat ones that will try to knock you down, oozing green ones that spit poisonous venom, and creepy crawling ones that sort of remind me of that chick from The Grudge movies. Variety aside, the coolest aspect of the undead infection is that the virus spreads in real-time. So if you see a poor soul bitten by one of the damned, don't turn your back on him -- he'll likely rise up and try to feast on you. Though the game has received a zombie face-lift, it still plays out in a very familiar way. The missions are the same style as in Red Dead Redemption, but they're altered. So instead of hunting for fugitives, you'll search for lost family members, and clearing out graveyards is a substitute for the gang hideouts. There are five new challenge ranks to conquer, wacky side-missions to enjoy and a main storyline full of theories of how the dead rose from their graves. It's every man and woman for themselves in a zombie apocalypse and the only thing worth fighting over is ammo, which explains the lack of cash in the economy. Such desperate times also call for desperate measures, and thankfully your actions are no longer measured by an Honor meter. So do what you want -- kill survivors and swipe their ammo or work in tandem with them. It's up to you. The intention of Undead Nightmare is to play around and have fun in a giant ludicrous sandbox world, not to make you feel guilty over murdering someone for a few bullets. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxboxlivemedia.ign.com%2Fxboxlive%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F113%2F1130683%2Fred-dead-redemption-undead-nightmare-20101026052838156-000.jpg&caption=Aim+for+their+ugly+mugs.When you come across towns you once explored in New Austin, West Elizabeth, or Mexico, you'll see they're slightly different this time around. Mainly, the undead are taking over and it's up to you to lend a helping hand. Your motives don't necessarily spring from the kindness of your heart. When you clear out a town, you are rewarded with ammo chests and the ability to use a safe house there. Undead Nightmare encourages (well, sort of forces, I guess) you to go out and explore the wilderness with the removal of campsite fast travel. It's too dangerous to park your tiny caravan randomly, so instead if you want to get around quickly you'll need to save settlements. Thankfully, you have easy access to a zombie horse -- just shoot your regular horse in the head, wait, and whistle. The undead steeds are much more resilient and won't get tired, but they're tough to control. Yeah, this can be a pain in the ass, but really, how are you going to find those mythical creatures if you fast travel all the time? That's right: mythical creatures. As you roam, you might get a notification that there's something in the area. If you see this, it usually indicates that one of the four horses of the Apocalypse is running around, just waiting for Marston's gentle touch. War, Pestilence, Famine, and Death are all available to break and use just as you would any other horse, and they're so much better. With basically unlimited stamina (which comes in real handy when traversing long distances) and a special power (War lights people on fire while Pestilence is almost impossible to kill), these horses kick ass. But if an outfit description is to be believed, there are even more amazing fantasy creatures out in the wilds to be tamed. A 6-plus hour side-story that takes place toward the end of Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare is a separate entry into the Wild West that you access from the main menu. Don't worry; it won't mess up your old saves. That said, if you haven't seen the credits roll in Red Dead Redemption, you might want to complete that story before heading into Undead Nightmare. While nothing will be spoiled for you, you'll miss humorous references scattered throughout the journey, and you probably won't appreciate the ending. Finally, the single-player portion of Undead Nightmare isn't without minor frustrations.  John Marston can still be difficult to maneuver (especially when you're trying to shimmy up a ladder while there are hungry zombies nearby), there's some slowdown, and it crashed on me once.  Despite these technical shortcomings, this add-on is still worth every penny. The single-player portion, while a significant chunk of this DLC, isn't all you get. There are two new multiplayer modes included, as well. The first, Undead Overrun, should feel very familiar -- you and some friends (or strangers) team up against wave after wave of zombies until you're overwhelmed. It's pretty fun and seems like a decent way to rack up XP points for your multiplayer characters. The second mode is found in Free Roam and actually has nothing to do with the undead at all. Titled Land Grab, you're basically trying to secure seven different locations throughout the map. It's available for anyone to play, but only folks with Undead Nightmare can initiate a game."

        "Content": "It almost seems rude to call Super Mario Galaxy 2 a sequel. Unlike most games that get the follow-up treatment these days, it simply isn't interested in the modern day mantra of bigger, brasher, more. In that respect, it's a follow-up bereft of marketing savvy, favouring subtle refinement over seismic innovation. That's selling things a bit short though and Nintendo hasn't simply delivered a gently messaged second helping of the original. Instead, it's scrutinised those brilliant concepts at the heart of the first game and added layer upon layer of dazzling invention around them.  Sure, there are new additions in Mario's latest adventure - some small, such as new Rock and Cloud power-ups, and some genuinely significant extras like Yoshi's much-welcome return. But Super Mario Galaxy 2's true success lies in its slavish dedication to the purity of Mario's platforming legacy, shaping a richly inventive, deeply rewarding adventure around that lean, classic core.    With countless iterations of the same formula stretching back almost 25 years now, it seems that radical game-shifting innovations simply aren't necessary anymore. Nintendo's had decades to perfect its craft and Mario's smallish set of movements - as joyously fluid and richly responsive as ever - have proven themselves time and again by now. It's that rock solid foundation that's enabled Nintendo to run rampant this time around - and the result in Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a game that charms and beguiles with its bold, bright parade of wild ideas and glorious surprises.  At first, it's all extremely familiar - almost underwhelming so - as Nintendo deftly reintroduces the basics of its gravity-bending platformer. Even its opening flourish feels like a half-hearted redux of Super Mario Galaxy's wondrous introduction and its first few levels offer a slow retread of Galaxy's hoop twirling and planetoid surfing. Yes, it's as beautiful as ever but there's not that instant, irresistible charm.    Perfunctory reintroductions out the way though and Super Mario Galaxy 2 suddenly catapults into a frantic, full-on assault of masterful design and ingenuity. Your first taste of this comes in the form of Yoshi. While Super Mario Sunshine brought the scaly green fella back as little more than a cameo, he's a genuine bona fide game mechanic this time around.  He's got his trademark hover jump and tongue grab but that's just the beginning. Using the Remote pointer, Yoshi latches onto objects, swinging through the air, and it's amazingly tactile and hugely satisfying. And, as with all of Mario's tricks this time around, these impressive opening gambits build and build as you go further into the game, fruits physically transforming Yoshi to open yet more possibilities as he floats skyward or races along impossible, stomach-churning tracks.   It's the same story for new power-ups such as the Rock and Cloud Mushroom. Simple in concept, the former turns Mario into an unstoppable wrecking ball while the latter offers the limited ability to create new platforms and paths, but they're stretched to creative breaking point as the game storms on. Even familiar elements like the Bee, Boo and Spring Mushrooms are given a new lease of life as Nintendo finds increasingly devious uses for them. It's genuinely draw-dropping at times - actually, scratch that, relentlessly so.  It's a key theme to this sequel - nothing ever outstays its welcome, meaning you're always left clamouring for more. It makes for an experience that's utterly compelling in its generosity, making virtually every other game we've seen in recent times look positively miserly in comparison. Even Galaxies themselves flash by in the blink of an eye this time around. Whereas the original Galaxy followed the familiar formula of its 3D predecessors, reusing large chunks of slightly repurposed levels five or six times to expand its adventure, Galaxy 2 rarely delivers more than half that amount of Star challenges before impatiently whisking you off to the next set of brazenly varied objectives.    Each gorgeously-realised world thinks nothing of tossing in a whole new take on gravity-defying platforming before casually casting it aside. Whether you're drilling through the earth to access increasingly convoluted pathways, flipping platforms from under your feet, scurrying across a much-expanded selection of side-scrolling courses or timing your progress to a gravity-switching metronome, it's all incredibly intuitive and brilliantly accessible thanks to myriad tweaks to Super Mario Galaxy's original formula. Controls are tighter, as is the camera, and there's plenty of assistance when the going starts to get tough, reintroducing some of Super Mario Bros. Wii's optional handholding for series newcomers.  Galaxy's been refined across the board in fact, with this sequel ditching its predecessor's charming but convoluted hub world in favour of more traditional 2D branching pathway progression. It's a move that does, in our eyes at least, rob the experience of some of its more delightful exploration elements but streamlines the series into a leaner, more breathless endeavour. The first game's more glaring faults have been addressed too, such as the infuriatingly flighty Prankster Comet challenges, now unlocked by collecting medallions in each level, which stay where they're put once revealed.    There's also the small matter of the first game's relative lack of challenge. Previously, it was a breeze to beat the game - or at least watch the credits roll - with its more fiendish moments held back for more persistent players. That's all changed this time around though and Galaxy 2 is never afraid to halt progress with a blindingly evil bit of design deviousness. Interestingly, Star quotas are a little more stringent this time around if you're to unlock the pathway ahead, meaning you're frequently forced to backtrack and dig deeper into each galaxy if you want to continue.  If there's one area that irks with Galaxy 2, it's this. Particularly as the game reaches its latter half, those much-needed Stars are often tied to Prankster Comet challenges, offering slightly remixed versions of levels you've already completed. With only a handful of variants - including speed-runs, coin grabs and sudden-death boss battles - they're one of the few areas where game elements outstay their welcome. They also offer some of the toughest challenges in the game, meaning you'll be playing and replaying them an awful lot. That's but a small criticism in the grand scheme of things though and one that's only possible to make in a game that consistently spoils with its relentless churn of glorious inventiveness."

        "Content": "Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV . The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. Without question, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-ass foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.   Be sure to watch the debut video review here. Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic. Much of the credit goes to the artists at Rockstar North who created as believable a city as possible. Liberty City is inspired by New York, but not beholden to it. While there are many parallels, Liberty exists in its own universe and rightfully so. Many open-world games have cities that feel as if they existed only from the moment you first turned on your console, but Liberty City looks lived in. It's an old city and each block has its own vibe and its own history. Drive around Liberty City and you'll be able to identify each individual block. Though Liberty is filled with brownstones and a myriad of similar brick buildings, you can tell one from the other, just as you can in New York. Go to an affluent neighborhood and the street is likely to be newly paved, the pedestrians better dressed, the cops more plentiful. But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying on the weak.  Niko is fresh off the boat. Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents. Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship.  Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself.  You never have to be alone. A high-priced call girl is always at the ready. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored.  \"The idea of a 'living, breathing city' has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place.\" To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade.  The explosions are wicked. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough.  \"There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge.\" There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.  You don't need a posse to rule the streets. Just a bat and balls of steel. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good.  The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller.  GTA IV plays out like a high-octane action flick. Michael Bay just got served. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary.  \"The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out.\" Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location.  Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next.  \"That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world, runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel.\" I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact.  Is it suicide if you take someone with you? You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.  The world is yours online. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud.  If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from.  A meeting of the online minds. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it.  \"Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends.\" And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer.  As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing."

But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying on the weak. Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents. Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship. Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored. \"The idea of a 'living, breathing city' has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place.\" \u201c To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight. This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough. \"There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge.\" \u201c There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good. The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary. \"The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out.\" \u201c Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location. Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next. \"That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world, runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel.\" \u201c I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact. You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud. If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it. \"Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends.\" \u201c And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer. As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing. For those curious about SIXAXIS controls, there are in full force in GTA IV. You can guide boats, bikes and cars tilting the controller. This only works well with boats, however, as bikes are far too squirrelly for the clumsy movements of SIXAXIS control. Helicopters are also very tough to control in this fashion -- it's as if Rockstar thought they were making a game about dragons. The mini-games, particularly bowling, also work with your guided movements and handle well. If you want traditional controls, you can turn SIXAXIS off for each individual input -- from the various vehicle types to reloading guns to specific mini-games. It's worth giving SIXAXIS a shot, but most likely you will shut this off."

        "Title": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time",
        "Content": "It's a masterpiece. An epic adventure \u2013 one of the greatest video games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of the most important and most popular games Nintendo's ever produced, and the company knows it. Since its initial release in November 1998, Ocarina of Time has been revisited and ported more than once. It's been made available in both grey and golden N64 cartridges, on a GameCube disc compilation with three other Zelda titles, and on another Cube release accompanying its remixed version, Master Quest. There have been a lot of ways to play Ocarina of Time over the years. Now, there's another.   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has been praised so widely and so often because it's a game that combined so many established \" Nintendo \" elements into one cohesive adventure, while at the same time innovating with all-new ideas that advanced 3D video games on an industry-wide scale. At its core, it's a traditional Zelda game \u2013 and as such, it follows the structure laid down by previous installments in that series, particularly A Link to the Past. You play as Link, a humble, green-garbed young man who's torn away from his peaceful existence in the Kokiri Forest and thrust into a journey much larger than he. You quest as a child, traveling across the land of Hyrule in search of three powerful artifacts. Then, all three collected, you can open the way to claiming the Master Sword \u2013 and that's when the adventure truly begins.   Ocarina of Time is built on a foundation of time travel, as taking in hand the blade of evil's bane sends your young Link seven years into the future, while replacing it in its pedestal sends you back into the past. Your quest spans both time periods in the Hyrulian kingdom, as you continue to find new dungeons to challenge, new items to wield and new characters to interact with on your way to the ultimate showdown with Ganon, the corrupt and powerful madman who's taken over the throne and who holds Princess Zelda captive.  That structure is just one thing \"Nintendo\" about this title. Another is its look. Nintendo revolutionized 3D worlds in video games with Super Mario 64, creating a free-roaming, go-anywhere experience with a controllable camera system. Ocarina of Time expanded on those innovations, offering an even larger world and more impressive control for interacting with it. A chief addition was Z-Targeting, a gameplay mechanic that allows you to lock on to an enemy in combat and focus on fighting it, rather than fighting with the camera trying to keep it in view.  Played on the Wii through the Virtual Console, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is just as impressive and timeless a design as ever. As a download, it makes some sacrifices in content beyond what its physical media releases have offered. But, at the same time, it offers new positives to counterbalance those negatives.   One of the excised elements is rumble support. Nintendo 64 games played on the Virtual Console won't shake the controller, which hasn't been an issue so far \u2013 previously released titles Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64 never had rumble to begin with anyway. Here, though, it means the Stone of Agony will no longer rock and roll. The Stone is one of the many collectible items in Ocarina of Time, and in previous versions of the game it served as a physical feedback hint system to let you know you were getting close to a secret. As the item isn't a requirement for any part of the game and was kind of gimmicky even in 1998, its newfound impotence isn't that big of an issue.  A new positive is the power of choice, as the VC OoT supports both the GameCube and Classic Controller. Either option works well, so it's just a matter of personal preference. If you've played either of the Cube disc re-releases of the game, you may already be comfortable with your favorite wireless Wavebird, but the Classic Controller doesn't disappoint once you get used to its feel in controlling the Hero of Time.

But it is also accurate to say that the GBC saved the best for last. That is, there are no two games better than Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons currently available on the system. And there never will be. Not only do the games capture everything that makes Zelda great, they are just right in terms of difficulty, game length and compatibility. In short, the Oracle games are the pinnacle of what can be created for this type of system. We can only hope that games as good as this find their way to the Advance. Individually, each of these titles would be the ultimate, but the fact that they both ship on the same day is unbelievable.  Features   Quest that lasts dozens of hours  Battery back-up  Interacts with Oracle of Seasons  Only for Game Boy Color   Oracle of Ages is a bit more complex and involved than its Seasons counterpart. The story is similar, even though it takes place in the mystical land of Labrynna. The evil sorceress Veran has possessed the body of Nayru, the peaceful Oracle of Ages, who controls the flow of time. Using the Oracle, Veran goes back to the past to build a tower that will block out the sun and allow evil to spread across the land. It's Link's job to restore order by tripping through the tunnels of time with the help of a magic Harp. The way the Harp changes the world is amazing. As time shifts back and forth from Present to Past, the map changes with it. As you master new Harp tunes, you'll be able to shift the flow of time back and forth so that you can access new parts of the map. This is a slick gameplay feature that really enhances the quest. As with every Zelda adventure, you'll see puzzles and objects early in the game that are inaccessible. But as you collect Items and Tunes, you'll eventually access every area in the land. In addition to the Harp, the special Items Link collects in Ages are innovative and fun. Some, like the Switch Hook, Roc's Feather and the Bracelet, you'll remember from Link's Awakening . Others, like the Mermaid Suit and Cane of Somaria are new to Ages . Each of the Items you receive helps you immediately. The game makes good use of almost every Item it introduces. Boss fights often hinge on whatever Item you picked up in the Dungeon. And as you progress through subsequent levels, Items don't get forgotten. You'll need them all the carry you through to the end. Mystical Seeds are new to the Zelda universe, and they are a dandy addition. These magical seeds can be found on Mystical Trees scattered throughout the realm and used in two different ways: straight out of Satchel or shot from the Seed Shooter. There are five kinds in total, and using them correctly will be one of the keys to surviving the adventure. All of your old animal friends have made their way back to the game: Moosh the blue bear, Ricky the kangaroo, and Dmitri the sea lizard each contribute to your adventure. In addition, the Zora, Tokay and Goron races are represented, as well as all of the old enemies. Octoroks, Leevers, Tektites, Moblins--all of the creatures that graced the original NES version of the game--are also here, as well as a few new faces. Generally, the monsters you'll meet in Labrynna are fairly wimpy, with the exception of a few sword-toting Soldiers, which can be tough to take down. As with all other Zelda games, you progress through a series of adventures that take you to eight Dungeons that are scattered throughout the land. In each Dungeon, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles in order to work your way through the maze, collecting Keys, Items and Rupees along the way. The puzzles were (for the most part) fresh and fun. Of course, there are the usual stumpers here as well. But if you're like me, you love the challenge. What's the fun of beating an easy game? At the midway point of each Dungeon, you'll battle a Mini-Boss. While some of these fights are quite simple, others require ingenious schemes and considerable skill. For instance, to fight the mole Subterror, you have to pop him out of the ground with a Shovel, then finish him off with your Sword. It is the same with the Boss fights. They are set at just the right level of difficulty. You'll likely fight a Boss a couple times before learning the secret to beating him. For instance, late in the game there is a Boss made of iron. It took me about four turns before I figured out I had to use my sword to bat his hands back into his face. I like this kind of learning curve. Not only does it extend gameplay, but makes me feel I've earned something by getting to the next level. The pace at which the quest unfolds is perfect. Just as you're getting mega-frustrated with a puzzle, you'll figure it out. Just when you think you've been everywhere, a new area will open up. It's a masterpiece of game design. The story elements are pretty standard for a Zelda game, but this is more nostalgic than bothersome. Besides, there's only so much you can do with story on this kind of format. In addition to the main quest, there are a couple of extra things to do. There is a sort of side quest that revolves around trading items with the various colorful characters scattered throughout Labrynna. This makes use of almost every character in the game, and results in getting an upgrade to your Wooden Sword. The other thing you can do is collect all of the Rings in the game. This is quite challenging, as several of the Rings are quite rare. You'll find them in chests and hidden caves and receive some through character events. But to get the most rare, you will have to master the art of planting Gasha Seeds. This can be done only on specific patches of soft soil located throughout the land. Plant a seed, leave it for awhile, then come back to find a fully-grown Gasha Nut. When you pluck the Nut, you'll find a new Ring (or power-up) inside. The more remote or odd the planting location, the rarer the Ring you receive. This quest for Rings adds a collection element to the game and makes for even more gameplay. The fact that you can swap Rings using the link cable adds a Pokemon feel to the game, which isn't bad. The thing that makes these games unique and extra fun to play is the linking feature. There are a couple of ways to do it, but each revolves around beating the game several times. When you conquer Ages , you will be given a password to start Seasons with. If you begin the second game with this code, some special features will be unlocked. First off, there will be more encounters with NPCs (non-player characters). Some of these will lead to Passwords, which can only be used after you complete this game, then replay Ages . These passwords will send you on short errands to retrieve secrets, that in turn give you valuable weapon and item power-ups. The linking also leads to three extra boss battles at the end of the game. Here, you'll get a chance to take on the witches Twinrova and the main baddie Ganon. It will also give you the opportunity to see Princess Zelda in a scene that does not exist in the non-linked game. As far as graphics go, they are above-average for the Gameboy. The colors are vibrant, the characters are quirky and as detailed as possible for the GBC. The environments are nice and big and the maps are well-done. Bottom line: it's as pretty as anything on the system. The sound is not mega-impressive, but what GBC sound is? The melody that accompanies gameplay starts out being whimsical and fun, but wears you down by the twentieth hour of gameplay. Still, the sound is better than a lot of the tinny fare that normally emits from the Game Boy speaker."

        "Content": "I'm reviewing Soul Calibur in a somewhat biased state. Soul Edge was probably my most favorite 3D fighter of all time. I loved it for its graphics, its unique weapons-based fighting system, its surrounding story, which brought together characters from different eras of history, its tremendous variety, and its phenomenal soundtrack. Throughout the latter part of the Saturn's life, you could easily spot me arguing with Saturn fanatics about how much better Soul Edge looked compared to Virtua Fighter II , and I'm still willing to defend that statement. So, Soul Calibur obviously had a lot to live up to. While a few glitches here and there and an occasionally bad piece of background music would be easily forgiven in any other game, my expectations of Soul Calibur were such that there'd be no similar leniency. I was expecting a damn near-perfect game. And guess what? True to form, Namco has indeed delivered the level of perfection I so longed for. Not only is Soul Calibur the finest fighting game I've ever played, but, with possible exception to titles such as Sonic and NFL 2K , it's also the number one reason to buy a Dreamcast later this year.  Where, oh where to begin? How about with the feature of the game that makes me far more interested in playing it than playing Virtua Fighter or Tekken : the story and characters. It all begins, apparently, with Cervantes, the evil pirate, and an apparent misunderstanding about the intentions of a particularly powerful twin sword, the Soul Edge mentioned in the first game's title. The game brings together characters from varying backgrounds and time periods, all of whom are seeking this Soul Edge for one reason or another. There's Sophitia, who worships, as all good Greeks should, Hepheastos, son of Hera, and knows the Soul Edge to be evil. There's Seung Mina, who left home in search of the Soul Edge, which she thinks to be a savior sword. Most interesting of all, though, would be Seigfried, who becomes possessed of the Soul Edge, and transforms into the Evil Seed. If any of this sounds foreign to you, then, you ought to obtain a copy of Soul Edge for your PlayStation and play through it like a madman. Or, just head on over to soulcalibur.com, and read through all the interwinding character biographies and storylines. If you don't find yourself intrigued, then may Pallas Athena herself take mercy on you.   Of course, try as a might, some people just won't take interest in the storylines or characters. There are the graphics nuts out there, for instance, whose interest in the product will be for nothing more than its graphical splendor. These individuals can take solace in the fact that Soul Calibur is a indeed a beautiful game. In fact, it's probably the most graphically impressive title you'll see on the American DC this year (only NFL2K has managed to impress me as much). There's just so much detail in the characters, more than in even Sega's own Virtua Fighter III (arcade or home). You'll see smooth curves, stray strands of hair, and free-flowing pieces of clothing. The characters, when viewed closely in the hidden profile mode, show some definite polygon edges, but when viewing them in a fight, which is how you're supposed to actually be viewing them, you'd be hard-pressed to tell that you weren't looking at perfect models.  The best part of the game's graphics, though, doesn't lie in its models, but rather in its animation. A quick look at the hidden exhibition mode, in which the characters practice their katas (fighting patterns) will reveal a level of animation closer to reality than has ever been successfully achieved in the arcade or home. The characters during these sequences move with unprecedented grace and beauty (well, assuming the character is supposed to be graceful, that is), and when viewing an actual fight, you'll see the same level of animation splendor. The game is actually much improved over its arcade counterpart in this area. I believe I'd only need to show off Xianghua's kata in order to sell the game, and the Dreamcast on anyone (the kata is actually available for download below). The backgrounds aren't as impressive as the characters; in fact, most of the Virtua Fighter III backgrounds have more depth and complexity than the Soul Calibur ones (the notable exception to this would have to be Soul Calibur's Venice stage, which seems to be the most beautiful 3D environment of them all). Still, though, the entire package, complete with the incredible lighting, shading, and reflection effects, come together as console gaming's current graphics leader.  The Venice stage is stunning, but, on the whole, the VFIII backgrounds are more impressive than those of Soul Calibur. Aurally, things are just as good, with a few exceptions. Thankfully (remember, I wouldn't have stood for it in any other way), the game features a legendary score, of the same caliber as the first tile. Everything has been re-recorded to take advantage of the DC's streaming audio abilities, so the result is a symphonic score that will bring a tear to your eye. Also adding to the aural quality is the voice acting. Namco has chosen to keep everything in Japanese this time, and the result is some top-notch spoken phrases by the characters. I will admit that certain characters sound strange speaking Japanese (Sophitia, for instance, sounded more Greek when she was speaking English in the first game), but the Japanese voice actors definitely know their stuff. Sound effects too are, for the most part, a high point. The weapon sounds in particular are well done, but the effects for the characters and their weapons striking the ground sound way off. I was going to do a full ten page report (single spaced) on the story, graphics, and sound of Soul Calibur , but I figured you'd like to hear about more than just that. After all, you're not going to be just looking at the screen when you get your DC on 9/9/99, you're going to be playing the bloody game! Now, let me get one thing out of the way. I'm a hardcore fighting game fan, but I'm not all that good at playing fighting games. Let's see . . . I know how to do a fireball, a dragon punch, and a sonic boom, and I think I know what combos, chains, and floats are. I still don't know how to consistently do an aerial rave move in X-men VS Street Fighter , though, and when people speak of a SPOD move in Virtua Fighter , I wonder what the hell they're talking about! That said, I love fighting games, be it 3D, 2D, or 2D pretending to be 3D. A quick look at my game collection will reveal no less than 15 titles from the genre. I have plenty of fun, staying up late at night with my buddies, fraying with one another, and this comes despite the fact that I'm not skilled-enough in the genre to appreciate the complexity of something like Virtua Fighter . Well here's a little reality check for all you hardcore fighters out there. Most of the people who'll be purchasing Soul Calibur on 9/9/99 and after are probably in the same boat as I. I just wanted to make that clear before commenting on Soul Calibur's gameplay, as an effort to avoid the tons of hate mail from Tekken babies saying \"but it's the exact same game!\" and Virtua Fighter nuts saying \"But it's just a button masher!\" As it stands, and for what it's worth, I believe Soul Calibur to be, without doubt, the finest fighting game I've ever played, whether it be 3D or 2D. My reason for this isn't because I can do a 100 hit combo when I feel like it, nor is it because there's some sort of \"zen feel to the game,\" as is everyone's favorite quote for Virtua Fighter . No, I'm praising Soul Calibur because I've never had so much fun with a fighting game. And that's ultimately what counts, right?  Upon considering what exactly makes me have so much fun with the game, I've come to a couple of reasons that I should probably pass on to you. First off is the level of control you're given over the characters. I think I'll take Seung Mina , my favorite character (also my favorite character from part 1), as an example. This babiliscious Korean babe uses (according to soulcalibur.com) a Zanba-To as her weapon. I've been able to make her do so many different things with her blade, by simply using subtle d-pad motions and a few button presses. Some examples that come to mind include having her spin the weapon like a baton, stick it out in front of here in an apparent effort to knock the footing out from under her opponent, swing it in 180 degree motions from her left to right side, as well as a whole myriad of other things. I suppose this is no different from Virtua Fighter or Tekken , games which promise hundreds of moves from their characters, but it just seems to be so much more obvious, at least to the casual fighter like myself. I have a feeling that most of the people who purchase the game on 9/9/99 will feel the same way. Also contributing to this feeling of all-out control is the so-called 8-way run mode Namco has created. In Soul Edge , you were given limited ability to navigate your way around the battle field; you could move away and towards, of course, but you could also rotate around your opponent by using a button press. Soul Calibur takes this a lot farther by allowing you full movement through the arena in all 8 directions. There are some interesting things that can be done in the game when strategically using this 8-way run, and Namco has thankfully put a great deal of thought into its implementation. First off, the fighters seem to always face one another when in the 8-way run (unless, of course, one player just sits there like a monkey, not moving at all - this is something that the computer can be accused of, unfortunately), so it's easier to strike someone than it is in a fully free-roaming game like Power Stone . Also important is that your speed when backing away from an enemy is quite slow, so this form of movement can't be used for running away when you've wet your diapers. There are a couple of problems with the 8-way run, including the difficulty I have beginning the motion, and the awkward animation for some of the characters, but this is certainly a welcome feature. Beyond the massive sense of control, I'm also drawn into many of Soul Calibur's other gameplay features, including the ability to use your weapon as a means of repelling an opponent, the high speed pace of the battles as a whole, the ability to charge up your character (this replaces the cool-looking, but overall silly, single super-move of the first game). The game does have its share of problems, though. I miss some of Soul Edge's finer elements, like the paper-rock-scissors style weapon clashes, and I don't like how easy it is to float an enemy, nor do I like the ease with which characters seem to fall out of the ring. These problems are minor at best, though.  Everything else with regards to Soul Calibur can be attributed to the amount of care and effort Namco seems to put into all its home products. True to form, Namco has injected the home version of Soul Calibur with a whole host of new play modes and options. Immediately accessible are the practice mode, which Namco has made quite addictive by allowing two players to play simultaneously, the team battle mode, and the survival mode. All the other options are accessible by playing through the arcade mode and the Mission Battle Mode, the latter of which is similar to the Edge Master Mode of the first title, though not as well implemented. Basically, what you do is you pick a character and then travel around the world, battling various opponents under certain special conditions. For instance, you'll have to at one point battle Edge Master, but it's very difficult to connect a hit, as he's constantly blocking. The only way to defeat him is to use one of your character's unblockable moves; one hit will kill him, but pulling off the unblockable move isn't the easiest thing in the world. Other scenarios that come to mind include fighting while poisoned (your energy will slowly deplete), fighting an opponent who's energy slowly recovers, and fighting multiple opponents one after the other. Winning certain battles will earn you points which can be exchanged for pieces of artwork in the game's artwork gallery; opening certain pieces of artwork will, apparently at random, earn you the new options and mode. I'm not going to tell you how exactly these are gotten, as having them appear out of nowhere is half the fun, but here's a partial list of things I've found while playing through the game: a total of 18 characters (although I have no intention of ever using Yoshimitsu, Voldo, and Lizard Man, beyond the one time that you're required to use them), the 18 total stages, the liquid metal mode in which the characters assume liquid metal form (this looks UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE!), the three costumes for each character, a few additional weapons, about 300 or so pieces of high quality artwork (do I sense the subtle hint of a Soul Calibur animated series?), a mode which allows you to edit the intro (props for making Lizard Man the \"girl in the wind\"), and many other things that don't come to mind. I did get everything in the game (you know you've gotten everything when the title screen changes), but there are just so many things to get that it's almost overwhelming. You'll keep playing Soul Calibur in order to unlock these options, as they add so much to the game. I do miss the eight unlockable weapons per character from Soul Edge , and it's a little too easy to unlock things, but even still, Soul Calibur has been the longest one-player fighting experience of my life. Few games come to mind as \"required purchases,\" games that are so good that they have to be a part of your lineup. The original Soul Edge was such a game, and now Soul Calibur has earned a place alongside its brother. It may or may not be the most complicated fighting game out there - I'm not bold enough to make such a statement. I am bold enough, though, to state that I've never had so much fun with a fighting game than I had when playing Soul Calibur . -- Anoop Gantayat , who wishes Seung Mina would come to life, like in the classic Tom Hanks film Splash, only with Anoop as Tom Hanks, and Seung Mina as the mermaid."

        "Content": "What kinds of lessons do we learn from our favorite pieces of fiction? Are they simply a means for escapism and enjoyment, or can they also have a tangible impact on our lives? Having played nearly every RPG from developer Atlus, my answer to that last question is a resounding, \u201cYes.\u201d Metaphor: ReFantazio ponders these questions in both concrete and abstract ways through the lens of a politically charged fantasy RPG, further proving that there\u2019s real power in the stories games can tell. As familiar as it may feel at times, it also treads new territory with a sense of clarity in its message and an empathy that ripples throughout its harsh world. From its more intimate moments to the grand gestures in its main story, Metaphor makes a loud and clear statement \u2013 one that is both relevant to our world today and a timeless examination of the best and worst parts of humanity. Without much pretense, you\u2019re put into the shoes of a young man in the cold-hearted Kingdom of Euchronia. With the reigning king freshly murdered and his only son (whom you have an unexplained connection with) in a curse-bound coma, a magically-driven election soon kicks off as candidates compete for the open seat on the throne, yourself included. The inner workings of the election process and your role within it changes and evolves as the roughly 80-hour story unfolds, but this setup serves as the compelling drama that propels you through a land plagued with racism, inequality, poverty, religious extremism, and exploitation. Metaphor: ReFantazio Review - Screenshots 25 Images These themes are at the forefront of Metaphor, and they aren\u2019t just set-dressing \u2013 even a quick glance at its writing will tell you how it expresses its inherently progressive politics without pulling any punches. As you gain allies, interact with the people who embody these struggles, and travel across the land to earn the support of seemingly disparate societies, the story consistently demonstrates an understanding of the dynamics that give rise to such an ugly world. For a game called Metaphor, it\u2019s not exactly interested in subtext, and in some respects, that\u2019s to its advantage as it makes Atlus\u2019 stance unmistakable. Metaphor is so very clearly built on the RPG foundations of Shin Megami Tensei and Persona that to think otherwise is to simply deny facts. The Persona framework, in particular, is incredibly effective for exploring its themes and letting you build meaningful connections with the events and people on the ground level. You live life through a daily calendar system \u2013 as time marches on and the age of a new king draws nearer, choosing how to spend your segmented afternoons and nights are as vital as making sure you take care of the main objectives that drive the story\u2019s major events. Thus, you find a balance between building bonds, progressing through monster-ridden dungeons, hitting the main quest\u2019s deadlines, and fitting all of that into a tight timeline. Compared to other Atlus joints, it\u2019s done with noticeably less filler, which keeps up a sense of momentum that makes sense in the context of the story. There\u2019s both a comfort in familiar systems and an excitement in how they are shaken up. \u201c Take the Bond/Follower and the Royal Virtue systems, for example \u2013 they are adaptations of Persona\u2019s social links and social stats, but refined. There\u2019s less mystery to how and when you rank up since the conditions for leveling up bonds are made clearer and progress in virtue stats are explicitly shown. It\u2019s one way in which Metaphor delivers already compelling systems more effectively and efficiently. That incentivizes you to see its full message too, as you\u2019ll connect with people from all walks of life who are all victims of an unjust society in some form. And for a story about gaining the trust and support of people across the world, there\u2019s a thematic coherence to taking the time to help uplift those who\u2019ve been left to rot in their misfortune. Sidequests also fill out the in-between moments nicely, taking you to various optional dungeons across the kingdom either through the guise of hunting for bounties or doing a favor for an NPC. These offer more meat when it comes to combat where tough enemies litter these curated dungeons. You eventually see through the formula of dungeon layouts, which can get a little repetitive, but it gives you enough challenge to chew on and balances out the social aspects of Metaphor well. You\u2019ll also be treated to rewarding incentives, whether it be money, stronger gear, tons of XP to level up, or ranking your social status. How long do you expect story-based RPGs to last? A smooth 20 to 30 hours Upwards of 50 hours No more than 70 hours, please Give me 80+ hours, baby! Answer See Results Because you\u2019re running on limited time in the calendar system, taking days out of your schedule to venture off to sidequests and dungeons is more deliberate than a casual trip into Persona 5\u2019s Momentos. It also feeds into that feeling of a globe-trotting adventure perpetuated by the main story, so you\u2019re constantly on the move. The fact that your homebase is a Gauntlet Runner, a stylish steampunk-inspired ship with mechanical legs you use to venture from place to place, is such a smart idea for bringing your traveling band together. It also works as a hub to improve certain bonds, virtues, or combat stats in the time that it takes to get from one location to the next. Metaphor is good about not wasting a moment and constantly giving you something worth working toward, helping all its gameplay systems sensibly feed into each other. Metaphor wouldn\u2019t be complete without hard-nosed turn-based combat, however. It largely uses the principles of the SMT press-turn system, where both your party and enemies are given turn icons and exploiting elemental weaknesses awards extra actions. There\u2019s both a comfort in these familiar systems and an excitement in the way Metaphor changes things up. That is due in large part to Archetypes, which is effectively a class-based Job system that provides fun tools to fill different roles in your party of four. It offers a level of flexibility not seen in other Atlus RPGs because any party member can specialize in any of the Archetypes while also carrying skills over from others they\u2019ve leveled up \u2013 and how you compose your party leads to wild possibilities in combat. As you get into the late-game, you\u2019ll unlock advanced Archetypes that have some truly creative mechanics, especially when you factor in the Synthesis attacks; Not only does each Archetype have its own moveset, various combinations of Archetypes in the party let you access Synthesis attacks that consume multiple turn icons at once to unleash powerful spells for multi-hit moves or provide a major strategic advantage through unique buffs, and these can be the key to defeating the toughest bosses.

Continue playing See results Archetypes, Synthesis attacks, and the dynamic of elemental affinities are layered with tried-and-true mechanics that have been either elevated or revised to create something fresh. While many of Metaphor\u2019s hardest battles play out like turn-based puzzles, it\u2019s quite the thrill when you\u2019re able to devise a plan to overcome enemies who have specific quirks or are just flat-out powerful. There\u2019s a satisfaction in \u201cfiguring out\u201d the system in that it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re exploiting it, but rather understanding how to take advantage of the tools within its flexible RPG progression. Several other refinements mitigate the tedious grind that sometimes comes with turn-based RPGs. Weaving in a simple real-time action element mixes things up, letting you smack around an enemy early to then gain the advantage when initiating combat. It also works wonders for mitigating the tedium of churning through fodder since you can hack-and-slash low-level enemies without having to engage in a turn-based battle at all. Metaphor is also generous with the items it gives you to level up Archetypes outside of combat, even rewarding you with said items for using max-level Archetypes so you can bolster your other options. From all aspects of gameplay, whether it be in its combat systems or social sim mechanics, Metaphor is a smart evolution that streamlines the best parts of Atlus\u2019 RPGs. Even far-fetched fantasy stories can serve as inspiration to make our world a better place. \u201c Also like those that came before it, Metaphor has a striking sense of style. You can see it clearly in the bombastic gothic-inspired menus and UI elements, but that ethos extends to its world and character designs too. Sure, Atlus is playing into the fantasy genre this time, but it is so distinctly of the studio\u2019s aesthetic \u2013 one you just don\u2019t see in other games. It\u2019s like taking the famous Garden of Earthly Delights painting by Bosch and putting it in motion while also making it disgustingly deranged. Some of the boss designs are even inspired directly by that work, emblematic of Metaphor\u2019s inventive grotesque style, but that\u2019s also juxtaposed with the beautiful landscapes you visit on your journey and the anime cutscenes that bring critical story moments to life. It may not be the most technically impressive game when you look closely at its individual environments, but it makes a strong case for art direction being more important than raw graphical fidelity. That unique, fantastical vibe is supported by excellent music from long-time Persona composer Shoji Meguro. It\u2019s a heavily orchestral soundtrack with some wild opera-style vocals that create a sort of gravitas whether you\u2019re stepping into a new city or ambushing an enemy mob for the 100th time. Unlike his previous works, Metaphor is more of a classical score than it is a soundtrack comprised of individual songs on an album. It\u2019s different for sure, and it took some time for it to grow on me, but before I knew it, I\u2019d wake up with the melodies of the battle and town themes stuck in my head, humming along to them as I got deeper into my playthrough. It\u2019s not necessarily the emotional experience I\u2019ve gotten from Meguro\u2019s other soundtracks, but it is a strong and crucial part of Metaphor\u2019s identity.

I appreciate that it says all the right things about defying our circumstances and that collective action is what\u2019s going to uplift those who\u2019ve fallen through the cracks. But it has the teeth to show that ideal it is not clean or easy, too. For example, it has an empathetic view of belief systems in general, arguing that while religion as an institution can be exploited by unequivocally bad people, it shouldn\u2019t be conflated with faith itself being the problem \u2013 while also understanding that faith alone won\u2019t sustain a just society. There\u2019s a consistent throughline about how those in power prey on the fears and anxieties of the people as well, and it\u2019s electoral storyline explores how manipulative tyrannical figures can be in no uncertain terms. I was taken aback by the contrast Metaphor creates compared to other RPGs right from its opening moment, where you name yourself \u2013 the player \u2013 before doing anything else, with the tale of a banned book about a utopia driving the protagonist from there. I was constantly curious about the ways it would break the fourth wall after that, vaguely referring to this utopia as an idealized reflection of our real modern world. But for the characters in Metaphor, that\u2019s their fantasy to strive for. Metaphor's party reflects the ever-present theme of diversity being one of humanity\u2019s greatest strengths. \u201c Admittedly, sometimes Metaphor\u2019s writing likes to go in circles, and its penchant for speaking plainly can manifest in repeating itself or relying on cliches. Tucked within that, however, are sharp, poetic lines that show the story knows the material it's working with. In some respects, Metaphor can be idealistic \u2013 but it\u2019s aware of idealism\u2019s limitations, and earns its hopeful moments by building a crew of characters who put in the work to fight the injustices within their kingdom. For as grand as its story gets, it\u2019s impressive that it still takes the time for camaraderie to blossom among one of the best RPG casts in recent memory. It\u2019s an eclectic party, each of whom have a clear purpose driven by tragedy, hope, and a strong sense of what they must do. Metaphor's party reflects the ever-present theme of diversity being one of humanity\u2019s greatest strengths. And in the year of our lord 2024, it\u2019s nice to have a powerful story say it outright and demonstrate that belief unapologetically. In a year that\u2019s been full of personally affecting stories in games \u2013 Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth , Persona 3 Reload and its DLC , Final Fantasy VII Rebirth , 1000xResist , Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail , all of which I reviewed \u2013 Metaphor still manages to secure a special place in my heart. It doesn\u2019t just resonate in specific moments, it also serves as a reminder that there\u2019s still a bigger world out there, and it\u2019s one that we can change for the better no matter how small our efforts may seem. If its main thesis is to express what fiction can do for our reality, my hope is that it resonates with others who take its message to heart, too."

But with all due respect to the monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom, the head of Hyrule\u2019s adventure isn\u2019t just another second-tier spinoff. Trust me when I say that in every way that matters, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the next mainline Zelda game (the 2D line, at least). It takes all of the linear dungeon crawling and key item-style progression I\u2019ve missed from the older games in this series and perfectly combines them with the ridiculously clever, freeform problem solving that made Tears of the Kingdom so captivating. It doesn\u2019t always take this exciting step forward with unflappable royal grace, but it\u2019s still easily become one of my favorite Zelda games \u2013 with or without a green tunic on my back.

Thanks to a little floating friend named Tri who accompanies you, you have the power to create echoes of any enemy you defeat and an array of specific objects you come across. That means defeating a Moblin once will let you summon it to automatically fight for you in the future, and you\u2019ll frequently create beds, boxes, and even trampolines to clear gaps or climb ledges as you explore. The menu you use to swap between your collection of summonable creatures and items does quickly balloon into an annoying-to-navigate pile, but it\u2019s so cool that the number of echoes you can actually have out at the same time is only capped by an upgradable point system \u2013 starting at three and going up from there \u2013 and that always feels fun to plan around rather than than overly limiting. It encourages the same \"break the game\u201d creativity as Tears. \u201c Echoes encourages the same \u201cgo ahead and break our game\u201d creativity that Nintendo embraced with Breath of the Wild and doubled down on with Tears of the Kingdom, but this time in a 2D Zelda game that borrows the Link\u2019s Awakening remake\u2019s delightfully toy-like art style and occasional side-scrolling segments (as well as a bit of its inconsistent framerate, which isn\u2019t wildly distracting but does also feel sort of inexcusable at this point. Where\u2019s that Switch 2, Nintendo?). I get that the echo system may sound far too quirky to be considered anything but an experimental spinoff of the traditional sword and shield combat we\u2019ve seen in pretty much every 2D Zelda since the original in 1986, but the reason it\u2019s able to stay so distinctly Zelda is because many of these echoes essentially act as classic key items. You may not have a hookshot, but that floating floor tile you\u2019ll only find in a certain cave can suddenly let you clear large pits in a similar way; there\u2019s no shovel this time, but a little mole friend will happily dig up secrets for you; and Skyward Sword \u2019s Gust Bellows isn\u2019t back, but holding a Wind Cannon above your head will clear away piles of sand just as well. Do you prefer Zelda's structure pre- or post-Breath of the Wild? Pre, I miss dungeons and key items Post, I love the freeform nature I want both Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results The fact that so many of the most useful echoes are either tucked away in optional caves or found in dungeons (alongside some important central abilities, like Tri\u2019s power to lift and move any object, Ultra Hand-style) gives Echoes of Wisdom a sense of progression that I must admit I missed while playing Breath of the Wild and its sequel. You still have immense freedom to explore where you want and solve problems in unexpected ways, but I love that you also have that classic Zelda feeling of leaving most dungeons with something new in your pocket. Sure, sometimes you\u2019ll just get another middling summonable monster you\u2019ll probably never use \u2013 but other times you\u2019ll casually be handed something like the Water Block, a Minecraft-like cube which fundamentally changed how I moved around the map by letting me swim up or along walls with ease. The exceptional puzzle rooms in Echoes of Wisdom also make great use of the absurd range of options you are given. Seeing a chest just out of reach would get my mind racing right away as I thought back through the exhaustive list of stuff I could summon that might help me out. That could be as simple as creating a monster to hit a switch for me, or as weird as stacking multiple things in just the right way to let me grab an object with Tri and then lift it past a series of obstacles and onto a button from afar. There is rarely one right answer, and the \u201ca-ha!\u201d moments are plentiful. Exceptional puzzles make great use of your absurd range of options. \u201c That said, the one place Echoes of Wisdom doesn\u2019t really benefit from being built entirely around summons is combat. While puzzles really are more of the focus this time around, there\u2019s essentially just as much combat as ever as well, and summoning a few echoes only to watch them slowly attack your target isn\u2019t exactly thrilling stuff. This is coming from someone who typically loves playing as summoning classes in games like Diablo or Frosthaven, but in those instances you usually aren\u2019t just spawning in a few dudes and then sitting on your hands until they finish the job. You do get some faster or harder-hitting options (the wide-spinning Peahat was an early favorite of mine) as you go, and fights are by no means unpleasant or anything like that, but swinging a sword as Link is still just fundamentally more fun. Zelda isn\u2019t a helpless damsel. \u201c Thankfully, Zelda isn\u2019t a helpless damsel who relies entirely on others to fight for her: she literally has Link\u2019s sword and can swap to \u201cSwordfighter Mode\u201d to attack directly at pretty much any time. However, your energy bar drains quickly while in that form, and that resource is limited enough that you can\u2019t rely on it too heavily. The bar can be upgraded, but running out in the middle of a harder fight or a boss can be a real hassle if you don\u2019t have any energy recovery items on hand, so I was always a little cautious about when I chose to pull out my blade. That means your combat options are essentially letting someone else handle fights or taking matters into your own hands with the pressure of a ticking clock, both of which are entertaining, but not to the same buttery smooth degree that echoes improve exploration and puzzle solving.

Continue playing See results Combat does at least get a little more interesting later on thanks to the completely optional (and surprisingly easy-to-miss) automaton system. This small selection of buildable robots don\u2019t cost any points to pull out of your pocket, but you can only use one at a time, they need to then be wound up manually before they start doing their job, and you\u2019ll have to pay to repair them if they take too much damage. The payoff can be worth it though, with options like a Deku Baba that can eat enemies whole and a sword-wielding Moblin with a slow but massive area-of-effect slice. That makes them a pretty neat high risk/high reward option, and gives you a little more to do after summoning echoes in combat without having to spend any energy. Another way automaton power is balanced is that you have to assist one character in constructing by completing a series of side quests \u2013 and Echoes of Wisdom has a lot of side quests. While it took me roughly 23 hours to roll credits, you could certainly make it there much faster if you are mainlining the story. My playthrough was fairly comprehensive, completing every quest I could find and hunting down collectibles, but I also wasn\u2019t shooting for 100% completion. Going out of my way always felt worth it, be that because of the tangible rewards I would get, the useful new echoes I might find, the charming characters and stories I would encounter (a village of adorable Deku Scrubs obsessed with sweets is a real highlight to look out for), or the multiple entirely optional mini-dungeons I could complete, each of which has its own unique boss fight.

Longtime fans will notice that parts of the map are nearly exact replicas of the SNES terrain, down to the little elevated platform just south of Hyrule Castle that Link\u2019s house was on (though it\u2019s absent here). Meanwhile, other areas have defining features of the Breath of the Wild map where you would expect them, from the Gerudo village in the southwest to an electricity-filled jungle in the southeast. The Zora are even split into two rival tribes: one with the fishtail heads of their modern design and the other with the finned-faces of the ones that would pop out of the water to attack you more than 30 years ago. In that way, Echoes of Wisdom feels like Nintendo fully embracing both the past and the present of Zelda, mixing what this series used to be and what Breath of the Wild so abruptly pivoted toward into a single game that honors and makes the best of both halves."

        "Content": "This November, I will have been playing World of Warcraft for 20 years, which is hard to even comprehend. And while I've certainly had a bit of a love-hate relationship with it, I think I can confidently say that The War Within represents the best it's ever been. From the story, to the environments, to the music, to the new features, this is WoW firing on all cylinders. The biggest improvement, philosophically, is that Blizzard seems to actually want everyone to get to see the whole expansion this time around. As someone who began my journey with this series in Warcraft II and is very invested in the story, but doesn't really like to interact with randos and doesn't have any friends left who still play this game from the group I started out with in 2004, this has never previously been the case. Every IGN World of Warcraft Review 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask All the juicy plot stuff was locked behind either joining an endgame guild, which can be like a part-time job, or queueing for pick-up-groups which, let's be honest, has almost always been a terrible experience, and I don't even know if it's fixable. Random groups always want to finish a dungeon as fast as possible. If there's a dumb shortcut where you have to jump across a one-pixel ledge to skip one pull, they expect you to do it. And they assume everyone should have already studied every mechanic in every boss fight before even attempting it, ruining any surprises if it's your first time through. It's kind of a rancid culture, and WoW's game design has unintentionally encouraged it. In contrast, the first time I ran through one of The War Within's follower dungeons, which let you take in the story solo at your own pace with a group of NPC helpers, I am not playing it up to say I almost cried. As a type of player who feels like they've been left behind for twenty years, this is the most listened to I've ever felt by these devs. It's not just the repeatable follower dungeons, either. Some of the five-man instances even have a separate, tailored story version with tweaked mechanics and bosses that you play through with important lore characters at your side, and you might even be treated to a well-produced cutscene at the end. As a type of player who feels like they've been left behind for twenty years, this is the most listened to I've ever felt by these devs. \u201c I can't overstate how much World of Warcraft is completely transformed for me now that, if I see something cool on the wall of a dungeon that an artist worked really hard on, I can stop and look at it for as long as I want and I don't have to worry about four other people getting mad at me. I can pause and casually read through a boss's journal entry when I get to them, instead of having to spoil the entire instance before I even go in by familiarizing myself with fights I haven't seen yet. If I do want to eventually run with other people, I can practice these fights on my own, as many times as I want, without ever getting yelled at or wasting anyone else's time. I can get up in the middle of a dungeon to make a sandwich, or use the restroom, or take the dog for a walk, or go get a beer at the bar. I'm living every Hunter's dream: pulling every trash group when I feel like it and knowing the tank will happily just go along with whatever I want and make it work. Because she's not real. I'm the main character. Also Azeroth's favorite princess, and the most interesting girl in the world. This is, simply put, a vastly more enjoyable way to play a video game for me. And it might be the biggest step WoW has taken forward design-wise in the two decades I've been playing it. They're even adding a story mode for raids in a later patch, and while I'm a little bit disappointed it will only feature the final boss instead of the whole instance, at least it will let you see the goddamn ending. In almost every previous expansion, I've had to look that up on YouTube, which is absurd considering I paid for the whole expansion. I think the main reason I didn't like Dragonflight as much as a lot of longtime WoW players did, is that it was an expansion for people who already liked what WoW has always been. The War Within is an expansion for people like me, who have always wanted to love the endgame but never quite could. For people who adore these characters and this world, and may have bonded with them back when they were introduced through a single-player RTS, but don't have the ability or desire to weave a raid schedule into all of our other responsibilities or put up with the stressful, fun-ruining ordeal of pick-up groups. The blatant catering to my playstyle continues with Delves, the new solo dungeons that are meant to be something of an alternative to raids and Mythic+ in the endgame. They feature the same kinds of silly and ridiculous temporary power-ups I adored from Torghast, including one that gives you a double jump and another that greatly increases your damage as long as you never fall below half health. If Torghast has only one fan, it is me. If Torghast has no fans, then I am gone from this Earth. So it's great to see some of the things that worked about it coming back. Delves get really, satisfyingly hard at the highest tiers. \u201c One Delve I played has what are effectively the jump mushrooms from Sonic the Hedgehog, allowing you to explore vertically in a new way, and another features wall-mounted ledges you can zip up to with a grappling hook. They get really, satisfyingly hard at the highest tiers, too \u2013 though I think certain mechanics, like unavoidable AoEs that can one-shot less tanky characters are a bit annoying, since they're purely a gear check and don't care about player skill. But clawing my way up the gear ladder to the point that I could do high-level Delves more comfortably felt extremely rewarding. I pushed myself to the limit and took on something that was intended for players well above my item level, got better gear, and was able to then do it more comfortably. This is what top-level content should feel like. At least, that's how it works in theory. As I'm writing this, Blizzard just pushed a hotfix that broke scaling in high-level Delves for everyone and made them almost impossible to complete. And this is only one of many bugs I've encountered. Unfortunately, this isn't a highly polished endgame experience. From missing voice lines in some cutscenes to max-level world quests with spawn rates so low, they have flocks of players circling the area on flying mounts like condors and rushing in to fight over one objective, there's a lot that feels like it could have used more testing once you hit 80. Some or all of this may be resolved by the time you're reading this, but I think it's important to point out that the state it\u2019s in around launch is disappointing. Calling All Hunters On the class design side, obviously I can't speak to every specialization as a single human being with limited time on this Earth. But I can speak quite intimately to the Marksmanship Hunter, which has been my main spec since 2018's Battle for Azeroth. And we're lucky in that I don't think we've ever been really let down by the devs, at least since I joined the archery team. The reason I've stuck with it so long is that it's consistently one of the most fun and thematically cool specs in WoW, and The War Within isn't an exception. The fundamentals are still strong. As for our hero talents, I've tried out both the night elf-themed Sentinel and the tortured soul, Sylvanas-inspired Dark Ranger, and I'm not in love with either one yet. Dark Ranger is the stronger of the two thematically, and if you've always wanted to play as Sylvanas, I think it scratches that itch really well. But it adds a new single-target attack, Black Arrow, which honestly makes the rotation just a little too complicated for my taste. The 20th Anniversary patch later this year is tying it to Kill Shot and also making Precise Shots a single-charge ability, which I think are great changes to streamline the rotation. But for now, it can be a lot to juggle. Sentinel doesn't add any new attack buttons, but rather relies on passive effects that change how I think about my existing ones. So far, so good. In theory, that's exactly what I'd like hero talents to do. And the capstone, Lunar Storm, puts a sparkly circle at your target's feet when you cast Rapid Fire that increases your damage toward anything inside of it. This has been a template for endgame Marksmanship abilities in previous expansions, and overall I think it works great. You call out an area and say, \"I'm going to kill those fools right over there.\" The issue with Lunar Storm is that it's tied strictly to Rapid Fire, and the area it creates is fixed to wherever the target was standing the moment you used it. This gives me very little control over where that area of increased damage is going to be. It's basically going to end up wherever my target happened to be standing when Rapid Fire came off cooldown, because it's rarely worth it to delay casting Rapid Fire to position Lunar Storm better. That can be a noticeable DPS loss, and it's assuming that there's even an enemy you can tag in an ideal spot anyway. What feature in The War Within are you most excited about? Delves Warbands Earthen Allied Race Story Mode Raids New Zones Xal'atath Hero Talents Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results I can't plan ahead and place it where I know my target is going to be in a few seconds to maximize its effect. It also doesn't come with the multitarget utility of my beloved Faerie Death Circle from Shadowlands, which allowed me to entirely ignore the idea of having a separate talent build for trash fights. I'll never forget you\u2026 I know I said I didn't want more buttons. And you could say that Lunar Storm's inflexibility increases the skill ceiling for the spec, which is generally a good thing in my opinion. But in this case, it's only in the same way that using toothpicks instead of chopsticks would increase the skill ceiling of eating a bowl of noodles. It's kind of disappointing and annoying, and I don't find that it leads me to making interesting tactical decisions. It works great in boss fights where the boss stands still for long periods of time, and in no other situations. As the lesser of two evils, I kind of do wish Lunar Storm had its own button, and I could place the area wherever I wanted. In a perfect world, maybe it would just replace an existing targeted area ability like, say, Binding Shot, and add that utility to its effects. Okay, if you don't play Marksmanship Hunter, you can rejoin us now. Whatever class you play , the new Warband system is excellent. \u201c As for the other classes I play, Retribution Paladin is also in a good place. The auto-attack haste build has never been more hilarious, for if you really don't want to push any buttons at all. I've been leveling a Resto Shaman for the first time since Cataclysm, and I haven't gotten into a good groove with it yet, but I also haven't hit 80 to try out their hero talents. Arcane Mage, if I'm honest, isn't where I'd like it to be this time. Fans of damage meters should have no issues, since they're doing great DPS, but as much as I don't mind them being the \"PhD spec,\" I don't think you should need a PhD just to optimize DPS when so many other classes can do comparable or better numbers with their far less complex rotations. In my mind, the big brain theming and high skill ceiling of Arcane should be expressed in its utility. I want to be like Doctor Strange, using teleportation and crowd control and time travel to make ingenious plays that don't purely rely on big damage numbers. Whatever class you play though, the new Warband system is excellent, including a shared bank between all characters on the same realm, and shared reputation tracks for all of The War Within's factions. Setting the Stage If you missed the big announcement last BlizzCon, The War Within is intended as the first part of a trilogy of expansions that aim to tell a larger, complete story. This is something WoW has never done before, and I'm pretty excited about it. Without spoiling too much, the first hour of that story definitely feels like we're going full speed ahead into something sweeping and epic. Some major sacred cows in the lore are actually on the chopping block (not literally \u2013 Baine is fine, don't worry). And Xal'atath is a compelling new nemesis. The first of The War Within's zones, the verdant and picturesque Isle of Dorn, which exists on the surface just above where the other 80 percent takes place, feels very familiar to a long-time WoW player in a lot of the same ways the Dragon Isles did. And basically all of the best features from Dragonflight are back. You get Skyriding (what used to be called Dragonriding) almost immediately, which I'm still conflicted about just because I think exploring new zones for the first time on the ground gives you more of a sense of place and grandeur. But I'm not conflicted at all about the return of thrilling aerial race courses and the fantastic expanded profession system. Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls. See All 1 World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Blizzard 2 World of Warcraft: Legion Blizzard 3 World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Blizzard 4 World of Warcraft: Shadowlands Blizzard 5 World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Blizzard 6 World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth Blizzard 7 World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Blizzard 8 World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor Blizzard 9 World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Blizzard Dornogal, the capital of the Earthen who protect Azeroth's depths, is one of the coolest hub cities we've ever gotten thanks to its majestic Titan architecture and an interesting political storyline to unravel. It's also quite a bit more organized and easier to navigate than the sometimes disorienting vertical layout of Valdrakken. Though performance has gotten pretty rough around here, at least during peak times, even on my 4070 Super. Down below, the Ringing Deeps is maybe the least impressive zone so far, with a theme that could best be described as \"big cave.\" But that's only in comparison to the Isle of Dorn and the show-stopping Hallowfall. I know people throw around poetic words like \"breathtaking\" a lot. But what I want to stress to you is, when I saw Hallowfall for the first time, I actually stopped breathing for a couple seconds at least. It might be the most unique, awe-inspiring zone Blizzard has ever designed, with a complete underground sea stretching out into the misty depths, beneath a colossal crystal embedded in the cavern's ceiling that serves as a subterranean sun. The scale of it is hard to get my head around. The War Within has some of my favorite WoW music since Wrath of the Lich King. \u201c Going even further down the rabbit hole, Azj'Kahet, the seat of Nerubian power, is like a whole other capital city, and the game board for a fascinating spy thriller power struggle that evokes some of the best parts of Suramar from Legion. The way the entire expansion is designed is kind of a photo negative of Dragonflight, in which you were slowly climbing the island to get to Thaldraszus at the top. Each of The War Within's zones takes you deeper into the bowels of Azeroth, which gives it some of the effective feel of a classic dungeon crawler. And the music! I can easily say The War Within has some of my favorite music in WoW since, dang, Wrath of the Lich King maybe? Since Blizzard\u2019s composers always kill it with their orchestral excellence, it's really something when they release this many tracks that stand out even by their high standards. Lorecraft Just like Dragonflight, the smaller zone quests are often memorable and touching. I think the one everybody's going to be talking about this time involves one of the semi-immortal Earthen realizing that his mind is starting to deteriorate, and asking you to help him set his affairs in order as he plans to end his own life instead of undergoing a hard reset to continue his duties without any of his prior memories. I never get tired of being reminded that, for all the world-shaking, high-fantasy shenanigans driving World of Warcraft at the plot level, these kinds of heartfelt and relatable tales are what actually make it special. As far as the plot is concerned, there have been plenty of exciting and significant moments already. I've enjoyed adventuring with Dagran Thaurissan II, the boss's kid who insisted on coming with you to the war, and who clearly shouldn't be here, but that's an argument I didn't have the time or energy for so now I just have to make sure he doesn't die. I was worried about Alleria Windrunner, who has been one of my favorites since she first appeared in Warcraft II. The whole edgelord vengeance thing has been done so many times before, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the writers have made her very much her own person, and chosen to highlight what makes her different from her sister Sylvanas instead of retreading tired tropes. What we said about World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Dragonflight reignites the sense of wonder and exploration that originally drew me to World of Warcraft, for about the first 30 or 40 hours. Beyond that, it definitely starts to feel a bit threadbare. Dragon riding is fun as hell, and I love the design of the new zones. But this expansion's back-to-basics approach is very much a double-edged sword. I probably won't burn out as fast because there aren't a million things to do every day just to feel like I'm keeping up like there were in Shadowlands. But at the same time, I don't feel like there's enough to do that's genuinely interesting once I've cleared all the very well-written side quests. An excellent new crafting system is gated behind mind-numbing amounts of mindless grinding for resources, in addition to weekly caps, which feels like a double jeopardy situation. I like Dragonflight, but I fell out of love with it not long after hitting max level. I really hope Blizzard looks at this as a rebuilding year for WoW, and doesn't hesitate to iterate on some of the inventive ideas in Shadowlands that were maybe only a step or two away from being great. - Leana Hafer, December 15, 2022 Score: 7 Read the full World of Warcraft: Dragonflight review . As much as I adore the new solo content, the group stuff is pretty strong this time around, too. The five-man dungeons, overall, are a step up from Dragonflight, which I thought played it a bit too safe and delivered some unmemorable adventures. There are a couple duds like that. The Rookery \u2013 which, to be fair, is the introductory dungeon \u2013 is about as simplistic as modern WoW dungeons get. There are some that took big risks and maybe didn't stick the landing: The Dawnbreaker is a swashbuckling action movie that has you flying between different airships, and while I think it's a bit janky in execution, I would always prefer them to try new stuff like this rather than play it safe. Then you have some that hit just the right spot. Cinderbrew Meadery comes to mind, where one fight requires your group to serve drinks to angry patrons or they'll pound on the tables harder and harder to deal AoE damage to the whole group. Not every boss in every dungeon is unique or exciting, but there are plenty that are. I really like the pacing of the endgame season so far. \u201c The raid, Nerub-ar Palace, is a satisfying capstone to the Queen Ansurek storyline with some tricky but not overly annoying bosses. The vibes and area design are creepy and epic. Even on Raid Finder, the encounters don't feel like totally mindless DPS races. This extends even to normal difficulty dungeons, too, where it seems like Blizzard has opted to include less punishing versions of mechanics you'll see on Heroic and Mythic from the very start instead of surprising you with new stuff as you climb the progression ladder. Instead of going, \"What is that?\" you'll be going, \"Oh, I've seen this mechanic before, but it's killing me a lot faster now.\" And that makes the learning process so much smoother. I also really like the pacing of the endgame season so far. It feels like there's just enough for me to do without ever feeling like I have to put in dozens of hours a week to maximize my progression. Eight max-level Delves will give you three pieces of vault gear that are basically equivalent to what can drop in a Heroic raid, which is much more generous than I was expecting. And the refresh rate on daily quests means that if you want to log in once a day, you can clean up your map in about 20 minutes, or play for an hour or so every three days, which is just about right."

I don\u2019t know if the developers used that as a checklist for things to improve in Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, but they may as well have because I\u2019m thrilled to see that they\u2019ve corrected all of those issues, and then some. Let\u2019s run down the new stuff and improvements: The newly renamed Story Mode is now a much brisker version of the base game\u2019s campaign that trims all of the fat and while also adding a new chapter; the fighting system has been completely overhauled for the better, adding several exciting new mechanics; there\u2019s better learning tools; rollback netcode; and even a Granblue-themed Fall Guys-esque mode included in the online lobby.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask I\u2019m not going to go in depth on every single mechanical change made to the core fighting of Rising \u2013 because there are quite a lot \u2013 but the biggest ones are the removal of universal techniques added after launch like Overdrive and Tactical Move, a brand-new variation of special moves called Ultimate Skills, a resource called Bravery Points, and then a handful of powerful abilities that use those Bravery Points. Ultimate Skills add a ton of utility to every character, which stacks another layer onto the meter management game. \u201c I personally didn\u2019t keep up with Granblue when Overdrive and Tactical Move were added, so I can\u2019t quite comment on how their absence feels, but I can say that the new additions all feel great. Ultimate Skills are new variations of special moves that add all sorts of powerful new properties to existing moves at the cost of 50% of your special meter, with 25% getting refunded if the skill hits. As an example, the Ultimate version of Katalina\u2019s Frozen Blade shoots out a massive blade from full-screen distance that goes through most projectiles and can crumple the opponent and allow her to get a combo if she\u2019s positioned well enough, forcing you to think twice before throwing a projectile at her when she\u2019s got 50 meter. Other characters, like Siegfried, can use the ultimate version of his down special to just straight up carry his opponent from one end of the stage to the other. In addition to that, these moves can also uniquely be used even while on cooldown. It\u2019s just a ton of utility added to every character; there\u2019s a lot of freedom to create new combo routes depending on whether you want big damage, a hard knockdown, or added corner carry; and stacks another layer onto the meter management game, which improves the thoughtful decision making that\u2019s central to any great fighting game. What We Said About Granblue Fantasy Versus Following in the footsteps of BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is one of Arc System Works\u2019 most approachable fighting games yet. It smartly balances considerations for more casual fighting game players without ever stepping on the toes of its hardcore audience. The result is a more grounded and neutral-heavy ArcSys alternative with all of the usual ArcSys flair, which is a fantastic breath of fresh air. Its RPG mode is dull, and its 11 character roster feels way too light, but all things considered, Granblue Fantasy: Versus feels like it could be the start of another special 2D fighting franchise. - Mitchell Saltzman. February 11, 2020.  Score: 9  Read our full Granblue Fantasy Versus Review Bravery Points, meanwhile, are a resource that\u2019s tied specifically to two new abilities: Raging Strikes and Brave Counters. Brave Counters are simple: You press two buttons simultaneously while blocking to push an opponent off of you at the cost of one BP. Raging Strikes, however, are massively powerful attacks that can be used during a blockstring to crush an opponent\u2019s guard if they just sit there blocking. That allows you to follow up with a Raging Chain attack, which in turn enables you to convert that hit into a full combo, even though the opponent blocked the attack. Not only that, but Raging Strike can also be used to continue combos off of far-reaching attacks that wouldn\u2019t typically be comboable. On paper, that may sound busted, but Raging Strikes are very smartly balanced, much like Drive Impacts are in Street Fighter 6. For one, they\u2019re super slow, and if they\u2019re being used predictably you can either just interrupt them with a jab or use a spot dodge that causes a cool looking slowdown effect, giving you plenty of time to do a big punish. The other important wrinkle in all of this is that Bravery Points also dramatically increase your defense if you bank them, so every point you spend means you\u2019ll take more damage from your enemy going forward. So you really have to make sure that you\u2019re using those points to seal out rounds as opposed to using them haphazardly. Sky Scrappers Pretty much everything else is what I remember from playing Granblue back in 2020. Which is to say, it\u2019s a uniquely beginner-friendly fighting game thanks to features like auto combos, easy one-button special move inputs (which also no longer incur added skill-cooldown penalties), and a very measured pace to the action that\u2019s far more akin to Street Fighter than most other ArcSys anime games. What is new for me, as someone who only played Granblue at launch, is the vast majority of the roster: it\u2019s shot up from a paltry 11 to a very respectable cast of 28 thanks to Rising including all of the DLC over the last three years, plus four entirely new characters. Whats your pick for best fighting game of the year? Street Fighter 6 Mortal Kombat 1 Nickelodeon All Star Brawl 2 Pocket Bravery Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising Other (Let us know in the comments) Answer See Results Even as someone who didn\u2019t play the mobile Gacha game and didn\u2019t watch much of the anime, the playable roster in Granblue is stellar. Every character is just bursting with personality, there\u2019s a great spread of different archetypes, the super moves are gorgeous, there are a ton of fun and unique intro exchanges between characters when a match begins, and the character designs themselves are just spectacular. The four brand-new characters \u2013 Nier, Grimm, Anilla, and Siegfried \u2013 all live up to that standard as well. My personal favorite is Siegfried, who is a Dragon Knight infused with dragon blood, and fights with a giant sword that hits like a truck. He\u2019s also able to sacrifice some of his health for a power buff that increases his damage up to three times, boosting his already-insane damage output even higher. Both Nier and Grimmnir are pretty technical characters, with Nier being a puppet character that relies on the position of both herself and her puppet, and Grimmnir being an extremely mobile character who can place down sigils that he can dash through, making for some absolutely wild and flashy-looking combos and set ups.

Ultimate Bandai Namco Super Smash Bros. Melee HAL Laboratory Tekken 7 Bandai Namco Killer Instinct Rare Mortal Kombat 11 NetherRealm Studios Mortal Kombat High Voltage Software Rounding out the newcomers is Anilla, who is much more straightforward, but still packs her own uniquely quirky charm by fighting with a spear that\u2019s bigger than she is, along with an army of sheep that she sends careening into her opponents. She\u2019s adorable. The new characters are at the forefront of Rising\u2019s new Story Mode chapter, which thankfully removes all of the extraneous RPG systems, weapon collecting, and so on. Instead, now you just earn skills that you can equip to your character for some sort of temporary boost or buff. Not that I ever really needed it \u2013 it\u2019s still ridiculously easy \u2013 with even the late-game bosses barely putting up any sort of fight. Ultimately, Story Mode is an improvement over GBFV's RPG Mode, but mostly because its much faster and less arduous to get through it. \u201c The fighting is secondary to the story though, and as far as the story goes, it\u2019s\u2026 fine. There are definitely some funny moments, mostly involving the Lowain trio, but the overarching plot is largely uninteresting and didn\u2019t quite have that big satisfying payoff that I was hoping for, given the buildup to the final few chapters. Ultimately, it\u2019s an improvement over the vanilla GBFV\u2019s RPG Mode, but mostly just because it\u2019s much faster and less arduous to get through it. It took me just about two or three hours to beat the new chapter, which felt like the exact amount of time I wanted to spend with it. . Rising to the Top Rising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus as well. Its training mode and learning tools are all far more fully featured, with a more detailed frame data display; quick character guides that give you an overview of what a character excels at and what buttons you should press at different ranges; and practical combo trials that give you combos for every situation, from anti-airs to counter-hit anti-airs, corners, and combos for when you hit your opponent with a raging strike. I never felt like I needed to search elsewhere to get a baseline level of competency with a new character, which is how a modern fighting game should be. Rising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus. \u201c The charming chibi avatar lobby system also returns from the base game, though this time it\u2019s been greatly expanded to be an actual virtual social hub where you can play soccer, go to the arcade and play a crane game for collectibles, queue up for ranked and casual matchmaking, or park next to one of the seemingly hundreds of arcade cabinets to play with other people in the lobby. It\u2019s not quite as impressive as Street Fighter 6\u2019s Battle Hub, and the performance is a little chuggy once you enter, but it\u2019s still a fun way to meet new players and experience online play in a way that goes beyond just endlessly queuing for matches. Of course, if that is what you want to do, you can still do that too. You don\u2019t have to engage in the lobby at all if you don\u2019t want to. The best thing, though, is the addition of rollback netcode, which at this point should virtually be a requirement for fighting games going forward. Online play feels as smooth as can be, on par with bar-setters like Street Fighter 6, Guilty Gear Strive, and Killer Instinct. Then there\u2019s Grand Bruise, which is \u2013 as crazy as it sounds \u2013 a Fall Guys-inspired game within a game that uses the lobby\u2019s chibi anime avatars in a platforming battle royale mode. And you know what? It\u2019s pretty fun! It combines Mario Kart-style item pickups with frantic platforming footraces, resulting in an absolutely chaotic mode that had me shouting and hollering in exactly the same ways that Fall Guys does. It\u2019s very obvious that Bruise is not meant to be a main attraction \u2013 there\u2019s no ability to create a custom lobby, there\u2019s only a paltry number of minigames to play right now, and some of those, like a wave based survival minigame, go on for a bit too long. Still, it\u2019s a fun diversion, and is especially a nice addition for those who opt for the free version of Rising, which includes Grand Bruise and a rotating selection of three playable characters, plus Gran."

        "Content": "Laika: Aged Through Blood\u2019s crumbling, post-apocalyptic world is brutal and unforgiving, and it won\u2019t give you many chances to forget that. Its pain and anguish is told through a story of reluctant revenge and desperate survival, heard in the mournful lyrics of its impeccable soundtrack and blasted through the barrel of the titular character\u2019s revolver \u2014 all while you\u2019re flipping through the air on a motorcycle and coating the wasteland in viscera. Though a bit more punishing than it needs to be at times, Laika manages to brilliantly meld its satisfying combat, beautiful music, and heartfelt story into a dazzling, bloody action game that\u2019s even greater than the sum of its parts Laika puts a clever spin on the 2D side scrolling metroidvania, as almost all of your exploration is done while riding a rugged motorbike across dangerous terrain. Whether growling along broken highways, zooming up the trunks of mighty trees, or doing loops along old rusted pipes, Laika makes smart use of balance-focused bike physics reminiscent of the Trials series. It routinely finds fun twists in its level design that challenge you in unexpected ways by driving through places no bike was meant to go, all while testing your abilities to quickly adapt to eliminating threats while still landing dangerous jumps.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask I won\u2019t sugarcoat it: You will die a lot \u2014 and a good amount of that may stem from mishandling your bike so badly that embarrassment became the real cause of death. Leaning back too far while trying to pop a rad wheelie. Attempting to do a sick spin off a ramp that\u2019s way too low to the ground. Simply face-planting at 0 mph. Just as the Super Mario series won\u2019t let you get very far without understanding how to jump, Laika doesn\u2019t pull any punches with its insistence that you truly respect its physics, which means being on constant alert to reposition your bike after every jump, ramp, and incline even when under constant fire from multiple threats. I won\u2019t sugarcoat it: You will die a lot. \u201c This may sound like a terribly un-fun disaster, and it very well could have been if not for the vital ways Laika softens its blows. Checkpoints are spaced rather mercifully, being both opt-in and never too far from each other to get you right back into gear moments after a grisly death. It also deviates from the usual playbook of losing all of your bloody viscera currency on death by only dropping a chunk of that total instead, allowing you to die more than once and still reclaim your lost goods \u2014 and even upgrade the amount of bags your currency is split between on death. In these ways, dying feels less like an aggravating setback and more like a quick reset on a particularly violent puzzle standing before you: Just how do you launch off three successive ramps, kill every enemy in your way, and land safely at the end? Stunt on These Crows It\u2019s when you solve these encounters that Laika shows how well it delivers on its promise. Soaring through the air, picking off assailants in quick succession while backflipping and parrying incoming bullets, before landing in an outrageous pool of blood feels like a mesmerizingly brutal ballet. Combat is so intrinsically tied to bike movement and handling that one cannot fully exist without the other. Even the act of reloading your weapon\u2019s meager ammo capacity requires a mid-air backflip, which \u2014 aside from looking incredibly badass \u2014 goads you into performing daredevil stunts, and gives ample slowed down bullet-time as you aim down the sights before making the kill shot. Which Video Game Power Would You Want to Have? Reload After Death Fast Travel Health Regen Double Jumps Inventory Space Other - Tell Us in the Comments! Answer See Results The titular coyote Laika is what you might consider a glass hand cannon: able to deliver one-hit kills with impunity, but always one stray bullet away from respawning at a checkpoint. Developer Brainwash Gang isn\u2019t so cruel as to not give you a fighting chance with some great additional tactical features, though. A quick tap to drift your bike can block incoming hits, in addition to a single reflective parry that can be recharged via a frontflip (adding another layer of split-second decision making to your daredevil moves). Tilting your bike also allows incoming bullets to bounce harmlessly off the bottom \u2014 just so long as you remember to land upright. I\u2019m especially glad that Laika\u2019s targeting reticle includes a small arrow depicting your bike\u2019s positioning, which turns bright red when you\u2019re poised to land badly. Considering how frantic encounters can get with bullets, blood, and explosions everywhere, being able to focus on both your targeting and positioning in the same glance (and using slowed time to help correct both) is an incredibly smart move that helped me avoid a lot of scenarios that would have slammed the brakes on certain victory. Despite taking place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Laika: Aged Through Blood offers a great variety of terrain to ride through with some exceptional hand painted backdrops alongside interesting challenges in its level design. Zig-zagging up the mountain switchbacks of Where Iron Caresses the Sky felt worlds apart from navigating the scrap heaps and toxic pits of Where Rust Weaves, as skidding over crumbling junk threatened to keep me off balance while fending off gun-toting birds. In true metroid(motor?)vania style, the lands I explored would routinely branch out and interconnect in new ways, leading to certain condensed regions that reminded me more of Zelda dungeons than anything else. Combat is intrinsically tied to bike movement and handling. \u201c Riding a motorbike through broken, rusted ships or ominous temples should feel different than the open road, and Laika absolutely nails this change of pace with tighter rooms teeming with increased enemy placements that had me carefully considering who to target first. I was also impressed with how adept the camera was at zooming out at the right times to give me a brief heads up of the dangers to come, or expanding the field of view for a particularly challenging room to fit the entire screen. Most of these dungeon areas provided some fun challenges like navigating volatile gravity-defying air vents, or crashing down entire floors to create new paths. That being said, the ship area\u2019s insistence on using tightropes \u2014 which require constant use of wheelies to navigate safely \u2014 felt like it was starting to ask too much, requiring me to manage its often erratic balancing rope physics while enemies were also trying to kill me.

Both visually striking and imposing, I found the different arenas these enemies dwell in to be inventive and entertaining. While some fights involve navigating half-pipe rooms or halls to quickly reload between strikes, the constantly moving sections easily proved to be the most fun. Getting to outrun a giant \u201cMole Made of Sadness\u201d while dodging missiles until the perfect opportunity to perform a cinematic midair shot to its exposed weak point was consistently a blast. Bosses like the mole, or having to climb a lighthouse tower ahead of an armored crab, were a great example of showcasing the best blend of bike handling and combat in a gauntlet of obstacles. However, with some bosses having very long sections between chances to damage them, and any death putting you right back at the start, it sometimes got a little aggravating when a small mistake was costing me several minutes to claw my way back to that last sliver of boss health. Adding the fact that one particular boss arena was incredibly small, featured a single tiny hump to flip off and reload, with gutters to fall through in each corner, and also bullet hell of projectiles to avoid or scramble to shoot, it began to feel like the developer was throwing just a few too many obstacles for me to deal with at once. Over the course of Laika\u2019s war against the imperialist bird army, you\u2019ll have the chance to get a few much needed weapons and upgrades that sometimes unlocked areas I had driven past wondering how to approach. The shotgun was perhaps the most unexpected and useful of them all, with the kick from its knockback being powerful enough to provide short hops over terrain where ramps weren\u2019t readily available. I loved how it opened up some incredible risks in combat depending on how I utilized it; it was able to either kill all of my momentum at the worst time, provide increased airtime to reload, or even dodge incoming projectiles by knocking me out of harm\u2019s way at the last moment. 14 Best Modern Metroidvanias 15 Images The other weapons never quite matched the shotgun\u2019s tier of usefulness, but I very much appreciated how each weapon handled and fired slightly differently, and upgrading their ammo capacity or the degree of spin needed to reload made for a very worthwhile endeavor. I only wish the hookshot upgrade could have been nearly as useful, as I soon found it could only attach to extremely specific targets for one side quest and a single dungeon. It felt very much like one of those items you\u2019d find in a Zelda game used to complete the dungeon and then never needed again, and not being able to use it to grab onto enemies, resources, or ledges felt like it didn\u2019t reach its full potential. If Laika had just been about doing sick tricks on a bike and blasting evil, machine gun-wielding birds, I\u2019d still probably think it was a good game. What really puts it on a higher level is how well its story flows alongside everything you\u2019re doing. Laika\u2019s character hooked me almost immediately \u2014 a coyote mother with a bike and gun who witnesses the aftermath of the savage murder of her people, and her first instinct is to try and avoid an all-out war? It\u2019s not long until you begin to start piecing together Laika\u2019s trauma, as developer Brainwash Gang have leaned into the amount of dying you\u2019ll be doing and made it a core part of her character. Realizing exactly how her \u201ccurse\u201d of immortality makes her a warrior hero for her village \u2014 not by choice, but by necessity \u2014 fundamentally changed how I viewed her blood-soaked journey. Ballads For a Lone Gunslinger Most of Laika's music heard while traveling the world comes in the form of collectible cassettes. A good soundtrack can set the mood of a game. A great soundtrack can embody its soul, and become as important of a pillar as its story. I really can\u2019t sing enough praises for Laika: Aged Through Blood\u2019s soundtrack and all the clever ways it affects the world around you. Much of the music you\u2019ll hear while riding your bike through the desolate wastes consists of a variety of collectible cassette tapes passed down to Laika early on. Even with such an emphasis on brutal gunplay, blood, and viscera, Laika\u2019s soundtrack sidesteps high octane action music in favor of something entirely unique. Composer Beatriz Ruiz-Castillo (Be\u00edcoli) instead employs a mixture of melancholic ballads, mournful Spanish guitars, and emotional lullabies. Along with the subdued but optimistic melodies heard in Laika\u2019s village and home, I\u2019m in awe of how well this music pairs with Laika\u2019s desperate journey, heightening the isolation of the lonely road traveled by motorbike. I love that the music is so important to the characters of this wasteland, that the composer and singer herself exists as a character in the world (to which its dwellers have conflicting views about), and the events around meeting this character are something I did not expect to be as powerful as they were. Laika\u2019s soundtrack is the perfect example of how music in a video game can elevate it in ways that can\u2019t be replicated in other mediums. Laika\u2019s relationship with her family was a particular highlight (even when it was heart wrenching). Watching Laika try her best to keep her daughter\u2019s adorable innocence against an increasingly cruel and callous world provided a welcome whiplash between candid, light-hearted moments and punches to the gut, and succeeded in motivating me to search the wastelands for hours to find toys and treats. Juxtaposed against Laika\u2019s aging mother\u2019s insistence (and often hard-hearted approach) on preparing the child for the horrors of war, it was all too easy to get a sense of the impossible burden placed upon Laika. Her journey takes her to some pretty dark places, and it was riveting to see what an immortal coyote warrior is capable of when the safety of her loved ones is on the line. It was easy to get a sense of the impossible burden placed upon Laika. \u201c Your immediate family aren\u2019t the only people to protect in the wasteland, as Laika\u2019s \u201ccurse\u201d makes her the best candidate for protector of the aptly named \u201cWhere We Live\u201d (every place in this world is named like this and I absolutely love it). Not only is it a peaceful hub to return to after a long day of riding, but it\u2019s full of odd and quirky characters with their own problems and needs. There are plenty of small quests to undertake on behalf of the village\u2019s residents, and as you might expect from an unforgiving world, they don\u2019t always end on a happy note. I was glad to find that the inverse also holds true every so often, with characters making the choice to look towards a spark of hope or fleeting happiness in an otherwise dreadful situation. More than a few quests may feel a bit mundane in terms of having to track down an irrelevant object in the world, but as Laika herself writes in her journal for one such quest, \u201cthey\u2019re the difference between living or just surviving.\u201d I can respect that. Easily the most engaging side quests are those from Laika\u2019s own mother, due in part to the hilarious nature of their dysfunctional relationship, and to the revelations about Laika\u2019s past that shed a lot of painful light on what they\u2019ve gone through thanks to their family\u2019s curse. While I could have likely completed Laika\u2019s journey in just over 10 hours, I was more than happy to continue helping every person in need, getting a literal band back together, and finding every last present for Laika\u2019s dear Puppy before rolling credits after 16 hours (and I\u2019m still missing a weapon!)."

There's the complex galactic politics, the smooth blend of the futuristic and the ancient, and the deadly, sweeping splendor of Arrakis. When I first reviewed it in Early Access, Spice Wars already felt like a reasonably complete RTS. And after a year and a half of additions and refinements, it gleams even brighter. The core of each hour-ish-long fight for dominion over Dune is a well-paced real-time battle system that pulls off the difficult tightrope walk of being complex but not complicated. You can jump right into it and have a good time, but it really rewards understanding unit synergies, like the teamwork bonuses of the Atreides legions or the lone wolf, hit-and-run tactics of the Fremen. It's just the right amount of micro for me, too, where a little bit of repositioning will go a long way, but you don't need esports reflexes to get the most out of your army. Dune: Spice Wars Screenshots 22 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask One shakeup to this formula since the Early Access launch is the addition of airships, which are expensive, late-game units that can really turn the tide if used correctly. Or\u2026 they can be a giant waste of money if the AI keeps dancing them in and out of my missile turret range. Tactically, I really have not been impressed with the AI so far. This can even apply to your own units if you get a big enough group of them, as they tend to wiggle around nonsensically if clustered too closely together. As an RTS veteran, I had to turn the difficulty up to Hard to feel decently challenged in combat. But don\u2019t let its clumsiness on the battlefield make you complacent: the AI can be cunning and effective on the strategic level even on Normal, and will use the various diplomatic and espionage options to pull victory out from under you. Feeding these flashy clashes is a clever, hands-on resource system in which you're always having to decide when to sell and when to stockpile the ever-important spice based on changing exchange rates and a periodic Imperial tax that can levy punishing penalties on you if you don't pay. Whether it's manpower, political influence, or life-giving water, I never fell into a rut in this glimmering desert where I felt like I had enough of everything. Spice Wars always keeps you thirsty, which can lead to conflict even with a long-time ally if they just happen to beat you to that juicy spice field that's critical to your plans. Living in harmony with Arrakis is tangibly rewarded. \u201c The changes to how water works since Early Access launch have added a new strategic dimension, too. The supply system depletes the provisions of any ground unit crossing neutral or unfriendly territory, and they'll start taking health damage if they run out. Particularly dangerous are the deep deserts, which divide up the map with deadly expanses that drain supplies three times as fast. Running a surplus of water, though, increases both the maximum supplies your units can carry and their recharge speed at friendly settlements, so keeping your industrial operations minimal translates into freer movement across the planet. In a very tangible way, living in harmony with Arrakis rather than trying to reshape it is rewarded. The Fremen are the masters of the desert, being able to cross it more quickly and safely than other factions, as well as being able to gather spice without noisy harvesters that attract attention of the sandworm variety. Everyone else has to choose between setting up their harvesters to automatically evacuate at the first sign of a sandworm, which gives an ongoing debuff to their production, or be prepared to do so manually and swiftly when the interface warns you danger is coming. Sending ornithopters as escorts costs you a valuable scout but gives you an earlier warning to get the hell out, creating even more interesting trade-offs in the economic gameplay. Which Dune house/faction is the best? Atreides Harkonnen Fremen Smugglers Corrino Ecaz Answer See Results Of course, you can never actually remove the threat of the worms, so you have to learn to live with them. I really like how this reminds you that no matter how powerful you get, you still have to bow to Arrakis' unforgiving rules. In this way, the planet comes alive and becomes a character of its own, supported by gleaming stretches of dunes in the daytime and an eerily quiet, almost meditative sea of twinkling blue at night. The look of the units and buildings is a bit cartoonishly stylized, but putting everything together, it's gorgeous. The music and ambient sounds of wind and sand add to this skillfully. Above the dusty surface, high-level strategy simmers as each faction jockeys for position in the cutthroat space senate, the Landsraad. The Houses Atreides, Harkonnen, Corino, and Ecaz  are voting members with official representation, but all factions \u2013 including the unrecognized Fremen and Smugglers \u2013 can spend an Influence resource representing bribes and backroom deals to get what they\u2019re after. It sounds complex, but the way it works is very easy to follow, with resolutions like increasing the upkeep on certain goods or giving a faction the ability to raise special Imperial armies coming to a vote periodically. It's impressive how Spice Wars was able to bolt a fairly deep political system onto an already complex RTS without it feeling bloated, confusing, or unbalanced. Racing to divert resources into a detective game is exhilarating. \u201c There\u2019s even an assassination action that brings a great deal of tension to the espionage system. Collecting enough intel on a faction lets you launch an assassination attempt against their leader, the progress of which can be slowed down by the target devoting spies to counterespionage. If you're targeted, you have to spend money on localized scans to find the assassin, who could be hiding anywhere on the map. If you can't find them in time and send some units to arrest them, it's game over. I lost to this a couple times, but I wasn't frustrated by it. Win or lose, the race against the clock and having to divert my resources into a big detective game was exhilarating. And the costs to even attempt it mean foiling an assassination will put your would-be killer at a sudden disadvantage, so it feels balanced by risk. It\u2019s all handled by a UI that makes it relatively easy to keep up with. Since agents are one of the main ways you generate resources, a player who doesn't focus on espionage will naturally unlock operations that support their playstyle even if they're not actively engaging with it much. There\u2019s even an operation that immediately stops rebellions at the cost of intel, which may as well have been directly targeted to solve two of my biggest, specific complaints from that earlier review. Spy traits, like settlement traits on the map, can be ignored without crippling yourself, but add a little extra layer of optimization for min-maxers that will pay dividends if you're just a bit more meticulous. Outside of the standard skirmish, there are two extra modes; Kanly Duel is a fast-paced 1v1 showdown on a much smaller map with many elements like technology sped up. It seems purpose-made for competitive play, or just getting in a quick grudge match with a buddy. The other, much more sweeping mode is Conquest, an in-depth campaign that takes around eight or nine missions \u2013 roughly 12 hours \u2013 to complete. You unlock perks and passive resource income by conquering sectors on the turn-based campaign map, with bonus rewards for taking on challenging, optional objectives like deliberately refusing to pay the Imperial spice tax. Going into a mid-campaign mission with the off-map spice fields I conquered earlier created a meaningful sense of progression, as well as tactical escalation as factions with stronger starting income can build up bigger armies much faster. There's also a Pressure mechanic that pushes back against inevitable snowballing when you get too powerful. Controlling a lot of territory makes it more likely that the rival houses will attack or even try to assassinate you.

There are some maps, like the Volcanic Mountain Range, that don't contain spice or sandworms \u2013 for valid lore reasons, to be fair. So you have to sell other resources, like fuel cells, to drive your economy. It's kind of an interesting change of pace the first couple times, having to optimize settlements completely differently from how I was used to. But ultimately, Spice Wars just doesn't work as well without the, you know, spice. Or the worms. Dune without sandworms? What are we even doing here? You also can't play as the Smugglers or Fremen in Conquest, and as those are two of my favorite factions, that's a bit disappointing."

        "Content": "Ever since the original Pikmin sprouted up out of nowhere on the GameCube, this oddball puzzle-strategy series has always held a special place in my heart \u2013 but when I played Pikmin 4, my heart grew two sizes that day. While the earliest hours started out slower than I would have liked, it reminded me of an onion \u2013 in the best kind of way \u2013 in that every layer I peeled back added more and more depth, eventually growing into the best version of the idea at the heart of it. Not all of it is as challenging as I\u2019d have liked, but with twice as many enemy types and nearly four times the amount of hidden treasures I loved gathering in past games \u2013 along with its fantastic musical score, improved graphics, and next-level post-game content \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t put it down until finishing everything it had to offer. Right from the very start, there\u2019s a series first: While previous games have starred fan-favorite heroes such as Olimar and Louie, Pikmin 4 allows you to customize your character\u2019s hair, body type, and suit color. Though it\u2019s not the most spectacular character creator next to something like Street Fighter 6 , it\u2019s a nice touch as your color choices apply to your ship and everybody in your space crew as well. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask However, I spent far more time taking in the beautiful worlds of Pikmin 4 than checking out my own character. Pikmin 4 continues the series\u2019 tradition of playing as an alien the size of an ant exploring an Earth-like planet that is probably actually Earth. Charmingly most of the treasures you end up collecting are named after their appearance, so \u201cSpace Spinners\u201d and \u201cthe Stone of Advancement\u201d are really just fidget spinners and a Game Boy Advance SP. Thanks to all of the Pikmin games being made available on the Switch, it made it very easy to see just how far the series has come. Pikmin may not be as popular as Nintendo\u2019s other biggest names, but what it often lacks in mainstream popularity is the intensity that some fans have for the series including renting out ad space on a billboard in Times Square to promote it . Everything from the soil on the ground to the foliage everywhere on the maps is vibrant, and each location feels distinct. A simple garden filled with (literally) larger-than-life insects and flowers that tower over you is filled with obstacles like a broken potted plant that blocks a passage and a puddle in the dirt that becomes a small lake. A sandy beach reveals new paths to navigate and enemies to battle after the tide recedes, and a house with multiple sets of stairs becomes mountainlike until you find a way to create ramps so your tiny followers can recover the treasures hidden inside. If you could have one type of Pikmin in real life which one would you choose? Red Yellow Blue Rock Purple White Winged Ice Glow Answer See Results Much of the fun and strategy of Pikmin games comes from collecting and commanding different types of obedient little plant creatures to do your bidding, and generally avoiding sending them to their doom. It\u2019s not a full-on real-time strategy game like StarCraft, since there\u2019s no base-building and outside of the newly added night missions you don\u2019t have to worry about an enemy army attacking you back, but there\u2019s always a lot happening on screen when you have dozens of these multicolored minions doing things like digging tunnels and carrying treasures and you\u2019re literally hurling them into combat. For those jumping into Pikmin for the first time, it can seem like a lot, especially with nine types of cutesy creatures to master, having to split your attention between multiple objectives, and learning to manage your resources. To its great credit, Pikmin 4 does a gentle job of rolling out new Pikmin, items, and abilities at a pace that won\u2019t overwhelm with too many options too soon. Your first steps onto this world come with a large number of tutorials and explanations \u2013 though someone like myself, who has been playing Pikmin games for 22 years, may not be able to skip the dialogue fast enough because it rarely covers anything we don\u2019t already know. Pikmin 4 won\u2019t overwhelm with too many options too soon. \u201c One of the most immediately noticeable differences between Pikmin 4 and its predecessors is that here there\u2019s no limit to the number of days you have to finish the story like in the original, nor is there any threat of running out of supplies like in Pikmin 3, making it more of a casual rescue mission than a race against the clock. This decision is especially great for newcomers because it removes the pressure or worry of doing something wrong and being punished for the rest of your playthrough, but I enjoyed it too because it allowed me to tackle objectives in any order I liked and fulfill my inner need to see that 100% completion on each stage. It\u2019s comparable to how Dead Rising removed its time limit in the fourth game in recognition of the fact that, more often than not, people play games to escape from the tension of impending deadlines that haunt us in school or work. The Top 25 Switch Games 26 Images Even without a lot of time pressure, mistakes will still happen: maybe you\u2019ll misjudge an enemy attack range and become frozen, allowing a nearby enemy to crush or devour your Pikmin before you can react, or maybe you\u2019ll just accidentally chuck a few Pikmin off the map while you were trying to toss them at a piece of treasure hanging from a spiderweb to weight it down and break the web so you can bring it back to your ship. In previous games careless errors like these would\u2019ve meant spending precious time replenishing Pikmin before you can progress, but in Pikmin 4 we get a handy feature that can bail you out: Until you finish the current day, you can choose to rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. It\u2019s effectively a method of quickly reloading a checkpoint save, and as a perfectionist at heart, I found myself taking advantage of this system constantly in order to maximize my efficiency or save my valuable purple and white Pikmin that are scarce early on. It makes much more sense to retry a section rather than spending a chunk of my time the next day replacing Pikmin I lost. You can rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. \u201c The ability to rewind extends right up to the end of your expedition, which is a huge relief \u2013 if you have played Pikmin before, you are aware of how stressful it can be when that 10-second warning appears, signaling the end of the day, while you still have 60+ Pikmin carrying multiple objects from different locations. In Pikmin 4, if you are unable to gather them all before nightfall it will tell you how many you stand to lose if you choose to continue, but ask if you would like to rewind time to one of the checkpoints to try again instead. This was a huge time-saver and kept me from having to replay entire levels when I\u2019d only messed up the home stretch. What We Said About Pikmin 3 Deluxe Pikmin 3 Deluxe makes an already excellent game even better and transplants it onto a console where far more people have a chance to see how good it really is. Its Side Stories and difficulty modes aren\u2019t massive additions, but they gave me more of the already clever and fast-paced fun that made me fall in love with the original game seven years ago. And while not as flashy new missions, there are a downright impressive amount of smaller touches and quality-of-life adjustments throughout (including replacing the Wii U\u2019s Gamepad screen with Switch-friendly controls) that make this the best the Pikmin series has ever felt. There\u2019s plenty of reason to come back for returning players, and if you missed Pikmin 3 on the Wii U then you absolutely shouldn\u2019t repeat that mistake here. \u2013 Tom Marks, October 28, 2020 Score: 9 Read the full Pikmin 3 Deluxe review Among the many things to keep track of in Pikmin 4 is a wonderful new companion: the two-legged lil\u2019 pup Oatchi. He can carry you and your entire army of Pikmin on his back across obstacles like water, sniff out hidden items, and grant you the ability to jump to help you reach shortcuts and items like never before. His upgradable abilities gave me another reason to seek out crew members lost on the planet, because the reward for finding them is ability points that let you increase everything from his ability to carry heavy objects to improving his dig speeds. Those upgrades all felt impactful, though some, like having him fetch Pikmin for me, became obsolete once I unlocked the ability to summon them myself with the press of a button. Oatchi\u2019s charge attack became my favorite of his abilities. \u201c Out of all of them, Oatchi\u2019s charge attack became my favorite of his abilities. Higher levels give him the ability to stun enemies for longer periods, while at the same time sending my entire horde of Pikmin onto a target to dispatch them quickly. This proved to be one of the best strategies for combat, and with the exception of bosses, it usually took down most enemies in one move \u2013 if I had enough or the right types of Pikmin along for the ride. That\u2019s the real trick to Pikmin 4\u2019s combat because the 110 unique enemies (including new elemental variants of returning creatures like Bulborbs and Dweevils) increase the need to adjust the composition of your army to counter them. For instance, if you try to battle a Fiery Bulblax with anything other than red Pikmin they\u2019ll ignite and run off screaming to their doom, meanwhile the Horned Cannon Beetle kept its backside weak point hidden unless I tossed one of the larger Purple, Ice, or Rock Pikmin into its blowhole above its head. Discovering my Otachi strategy early was great because it allowed me to spend less time replacing Pikmin lost in combat and more time collecting the 239 treasures across the six locations and 22 cave sub-levels I explored. Though once I fully leveled Oatchi\u2019s Rush ability, it never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. It never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. \u201c Some of those sub-levels place you inside machine structures with conveyor belts, a kid's room filled with structures made from wooden blocks, and a freezer filled with cold-emitting dry ice that will freeze most Pikmin in their tracks. Navigating these kinds of hazards never failed to put a smile on my face \u2013 though it\u2019s a different kind of smile than the one that creeps in when I hear the cries of my loyal Pikmin that I sometimes tossed to their certain doom in order to reach my objective. There are also some very cool Easter eggs that I won\u2019t spoil for you, other than to say you will definitely want to give a close look at the musical items. Most boss battles are saved for the lower floors of the various cave sub-levels, and while there are plenty of returning faces here we also encounter a fun handful of new ones, like the Sovereign Bulblax and the Foolix, the latter of which is a clever evolution on the Goolix from the very first Pikmin. At first he caught me off guard (making me look like a fool, appropriately) thanks to its clever disguise as a drop of nectar. Considering all the new types of enemies with elemental properties and the fact that Pikmin 4 only lets you bring out three types of Pikmin at a time, I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. Rock Pikmin are a staple of mine, as their hardy core both deals high damage when flung at bosses and prevents them from being crushed under the weight of larger enemies like the Yellow Wollywog, but I\u2019d often switch between ice, winged, and white Pikmin when I knew I\u2019d need to counter threats like the airborne Lesser Spotted Jellyfloat or the toxic-based Moldy Slooch. Between those and Oatchi\u2019s list of skills, the scales usually felt tipped in my favor. You can control Oatchi directly, but I found him more helpful as Pikmin 4\u2019s method of splitting up your party so you can tackle more objectives simultaneously. From the map screen you can give him commands to find treasures, lost team members, and specific Pikmin types while you take care of tasks on the other side of the map. This gave me more options in general: while exploring the Serene Shores level, I would send Oatchi and Blue Pikmin to locations only accessible to them. At the same time, I took an army of Yellow and Red Pikmin across the beach, defeating enemies and digging up buried treasure.  Getting the hang of this multitasking is a necessity to earn the best rewards in some of the later challenges. I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. \u201c This leads me to a minor gripe about how co-op works in Pikmin 4. Unlike Pikmin 2 or 3, where a second player could take control of another character and the two of you could split up to help reduce the time it took to find everything on a stage, Pikmin 4 instead has your co-op partner play as a reticle floating around the screen that can throw pebbles to move objects or hit enemies as your character does his usual thing. I would consider it more of an assist mode, like what we saw in Super Mario Galaxy, rather than an actual co-op mode. That\u2019s a bit of a letdown for anyone wanting to play through with a friend or significant other like we did in the previous games, but I imagine it will be great for allowing kids to help out a parent or older sibling \u2013 or vice versa. As for the two new Pikmin types, the first you\u2019ll encounter are ice Pikmin, and with them comes the ability to freeze bodies of water and enemies. They quickly became one of my favorites thanks to their freezing effect, which works in tandem with Oatchi\u2019s stun and allows you to chain status effects on enemies big and small \u2013 instead of spending time defeating enemies, you can just freeze them for long enough to get in and out. They are also key to destroying various ice barriers, and for navigating some of the caves with freezing temperatures that slow other Pikmin down, making them a solid option in most situations. Glow Pikmin are the other new additions, but they are only really available in the regularly occurring night missions. There, you\u2019ll trade in your real-time strategy-style gameplay for a simplistic tower defense format where you\u2019re challenged to protect various anthill-like structures until morning (or until all enemies have been defeated) using only Glow Pikmin. The lower difficulty stages started out basic and short but soon evolved into levels with multiple points to defend from hordes of enemies, often requiring me to leave Oatchi on defense while I explored on foot to figure out the optimal routes for protecting multiple points from waves of enemies. I didn\u2019t really care for these early on, but around the midway point of the campaign they added some new terrifying creatures and secondary points to defend, finally introducing the complexity and enemy variety I craved. As someone who seeks out challenge, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of one of the other additions: a set of overpowered single-use items. Alongside the standard ultra-spicy spray that temporarily boosts Pikmin performance and the bomb rocks that destroy concrete walls we get single-use items like Lightning Shock that can paralyze everything on the screen with electricity. Being able to toss bombs with homing or proximity effects kills all the tension in battles that otherwise have me frantically dashing around and flinging Pikmin to defeat enemies while keeping my little guys from being eaten or crushed. After testing them all out I felt like I had to artificially limit my use of them in most situations because they removed any need to be strategic. This, again, is great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin, and they will surely appreciate the assistance, but since Pikmin 4 doesn\u2019t offer any difficulty settings (like some of the previous games in the series have) they feel like too easy of a solution. Items are great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin. \u201c The one limitation on the power of these special items is that the raw materials you use to purchase them is also tied to building bridges to give you shortcuts through levels and permanent upgrades for yourself and Oatchi. Even without using many items, sometimes I would find myself without enough raw materials to build a bridge because I spent too many on upgrades, requiring me to circle back and gather more from deeper in the level to build them. Upgrades were my favorite use of raw materials because they include everything from boots that increase your movement speed to suits that grant elemental immunities and armor to increase your HP and Defense. While most upgrades aren\u2019t required to finish the story there are some locations, like an entrance to one of Pikmin 4\u2019s many sub-levels hidden in the center of a stove\u2019s burner, which require you to have an elemental immunity for both yourself and Oatchi just to get inside. Purchasing these sorts of upgrades early on made obstacles less of an issue as I scoured the levels for more raw materials and other items, and kept me excited for the next upgrade to become available.

While I can\u2019t go into detail, I will say that the post-credits content in Pikmin 4 might just be the best the Pikmin series has ever delivered. In fact, Pikmin 4\u2019s greatest folly is that it saves the best of its new tricks until you have completed the campaign\u2019s first ending and seen the credits, because I would\u2019ve liked to have dived right into all of these creative locations, met their bizarre inhabitants, and unlocked its homage to previous Pikmin games. Beyond the story and what comes after, Pikmin 4 offers a pair of modes designed to test your aptitude at the concept of Dandori: a Japanese word for the practice of organizing tasks strategically and working effectively to execute plans. In the Dandori Challenges you must gather all the treasures in a set location with a limited number of Pikmin, and the final couple of courses buck Pikmin\u2019s trend of being kid-friendly and are sure to test the best Pikmin players out there if they want to earn the coveted Platinum medal. Some of these took me more than a handful of attempts! And then there\u2019s the Dandori Battle mode, a chaotic mix of combat and gathering, and it\u2019s an enjoyable way to challenge my multitasking skill against an opponent who wants to win just as much as I do. You can play against the AI or a friend in local multiplayer, which is nice, but it\u2019s a shame there's no online capability."

        "Content": "Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song\u2019s going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4 doesn\u2019t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo we\u2019ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them \u2013 as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of Hell, but the 80 hours I\u2019ve spent in Sanctuary have still been overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and obsessing over loot rolls, I\u2019m still very excited to play a whole lot more. Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its 30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You\u2019re once again sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and elemental effects that typically occupy the screen \u2013 and practically every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you\u2019re playing alone or with up to three friends. Running dungeons captures that familiar but just as compelling loop of killing hordes of enemies, completing objectives, and downing bosses, and running sidequests to learn more about the world\u2019s lore and characters is usually a very good time even while the main plot meanders. Diablo 4 Screenshots 50 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive innovations to the genre, however, you\u2019re likely to be disappointed in that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic character classes. This series had a lot of catching up to do in the 11 years since Diablo 3, and whether it\u2019s borrowing combat inspiration from Path of Exile or online elements from Lost Ark , there isn\u2019t really anything about what Diablo 4 does so well that is completely unprecedented. But while there may not be much in the way of game-changing innovations, the good news is that lack of experimentation has resulted in a game that\u2019s unbelievably well-designed and succeeds at practically everything it tries. I\u2019m one of those weirdos who actually closely follows the story in Diablo, and although Diablo 4\u2019s probably isn\u2019t going to win any awards, it is still a massive step in the right direction compared to its predecessor. The quest to find and stop Lilith, daughter of one of the Prime Evils of Hell, after she unleashes her fury upon Sanctuary serves as a fantastic kicking off point that I was still eager to unravel even after my eighth playthrough of the first act during the pre-launch beta. Gone are the days of WWE-like voice performances and dreadfully cheesy dialogue, and the queen of succubi is one of the most complex villains the series has ever seen, with motivations that even made me question the justness of my own cause. Sanctuary is a gorgeous sight to behold, and sounds even better. \u201c But before you get any real payoff for what\u2019s expertly set up in the first act, you\u2019ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn\u2019t quite stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or closely involved in whatever action is going on, it\u2019s absolutely engrossing stuff. But she\u2019s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions you\u2019re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours. Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won\u2019t spoil, especially the campaign\u2019s final one, and it\u2019s hard not to feel let down by what this could have been. It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of what\u2019s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It\u2019s no small feat, then, that Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell. Which Diablo 4 class are you going to main first? Barbarian Druid Necromancer Rogue Sorcerer I don't know yet! Answer See Results The ending of the story at least nicely sets up a whole host of possibilities for Diablo 4\u2019s live-service future and inevitable story expansions, but I find myself excited about the potential of where things might go more than I am happy about the base campaign we got overall. It\u2019s no wonder that Blizzard allows you to skip the campaign entirely for every character you make after the first time you complete it \u2013 a five-minute recap video would be just as effective as replaying the roughly 15-hour story. That might have been more disappointing if the brief campaign were meant to be the main course of this meal, but thankfully rolling credits in a Diablo game means you\u2019ve only just finished the appetizer. When it comes to the things that really matter in the long run like combat, buildcrafting, hunting for gear, and especially the endgame, Diablo 4 absolutely knocks it out of the park in practically every way. Even if they aren\u2019t perfectly balanced, all five character classes are a ton of fun to play as. The rogue darts around to deal extreme damage either in melee or from afar with a deadly bow in an exhilarating high risk/high reward tradeoff; The sorcerer creates horrifying cocktails of destruction, like an absolutely disgusting lightning build I brewed up to stun everything around me constantly; The necromancer raises an army of the dead, steals life, and manipulates the corpses of fallen enemies to carry out their foul desires, for when I\u2019m in the mood to keep my distance and let someone else do the hard work for me; When I just want to Hulk my way through the depths of Hell, the barbarian is an expert in all forms of smashing who can charge forward to destroy everything in their path; And the druid uses their Animorph abilities and the power of mother nature to wail on all manner of demons, with probably the most build diversity of any of the classes. Buildcrafting for each class feels distinct in some really cool ways. \u201c Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it\u2019s augmenting your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel distinct in some really cool ways. Gear can also substantially affect the paths you might choose to take a character down. For example, after completing a job for a demented tree, you could be rewarded with a magical pair of pants that heals you over time when standing close to enemies, warranting a shift in your build from slaying enemies from afar to something close quarters. Or maybe, like me, you\u2019ll get devilishly lucky when you find a weapon that has a chance of casting a random lightning spell for free whenever you cast an initial one, leading to absolute mayhem when you bring your electrical might to bear upon an unsuspecting huddle of bandits. What We Said About Diablo Immortal There\u2019s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn\u2019t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal\u2019s 600 paragon levels, and gradually \u2013 oh so gradually \u2013 ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it\u2019s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I\u2019m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it\u2019s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. - Cam Shea, June 1, 2022 Score: 6 Read our full Diablo Immortal Review . Trying out new builds and experimenting with powerful new pieces of equipment is one of the best parts of Diablo 4, and I spent most of my time on my sorcerer, where I continuously discovered new and extremely rude ways to be the best glass cannon I could be, like equipping an ice shield that froze enemies for the sin of attacking me to remove said shield. The variety of systems available to optimize your character are so numerous that it can be pretty dizzying at first, even for a Diablo veteran like me, but when properly mastered this is easily one of the best buildcrafting toolboxes of all time. Whether it\u2019s the dense skill trees, the endgame paragon boards and powerful glyphs that can be upgraded and socketed into them, the plethora of loot options across various world tiers and rarity levels, the gems and vendor upgrades you can use to make that equipment even better, or the fact that gear perks can be tweaked to optimize them for a certain build, Blizzard seems to have thought of just about everything. And all that control meant I never came close to feeling like my time wasn\u2019t being respected when a loot drop didn\u2019t happen to go my way. There are just so many ways to interact with your build and make smart use of your gear. For example, whenever I outleveled a cool piece of gear with an effect I loved, I could extract its key perk and keep it in my inventory to be imprinted on a more powerful piece of equipment down the road. And thankfully, Blizzard has backed down from its previous promises to make skill tree respecs prohibitively expensive. Instead, they merely hurt your in-game wallet enough that switching high-level characters to a new build is a serious consideration, but not one that\u2019s impossible or sends you straight to the poor house. After 80 hours on a single character, I was still discovering new ways to tweak and improve my build or new equipment perks that opened up exciting possibilities. That makes it very difficult to log off even when I found myself playing nearly until the sun came up once or twice. Running through bone-riddled dungeon halls is a consistent joy. \u201c Running through murky halls with my decked out murder machines feels significantly more streamlined since the dungeon tweaking Blizzard rolled out in response to feedback from the beta weekends, with far less backtracking and wasted time. That keeps things moving along at a great pace and makes diving into the bone-riddled halls of an ancient tomb or what I can only assume is a demon body parts exhibit a consistent joy. No matter what class you\u2019ve chosen, shredding your way through piles of wretched reprobates is usually effortless fun that lets you flex your unrivaled power, though some of the more difficult activities like Nightmare Dungeons are bound to put those skills to the test. There\u2019s also a good chance you\u2019ll run into a random event that might have you rescuing some poor souls who find themselves lost in a crypt, or get attacked by The Butcher, a familiar demon who enjoys meat hooks more than I thought possible. Admittedly, regular minions have very few unique mechanics I could discern in the few seconds it took to send them back to Hell with my coldest regards. Most just run at you while yelping or hurdle some pointy object at you from nearby, which doesn\u2019t make them feel all that different to fight even when they are part of some distinct and cool-looking enemy faction. But you do get the occasional breath of fresh air, like shamans that summon new enemies to the battlefield, making their summary executions a high priority, or skeletons that slowly shamble toward you with big, beefy shields until you\u2019re able to tear through their defenses and finish them off. Dungeon bosses have a bit of a similar inconsistency \u2013 I can only fight so many big, floating demon wizards called \u201cThe Curator\u201d or some such nonsense before it all just blends together into one big pile of satisfyingly defeated gore. But others are much more memorable, like one where a laughing cultist repeatedly summoned waves of freaks until he ran out of steam and was quickly turned into a bowl of mashed potatoes by me and my friends.

While this comes with the expected but rare hitches like getting disconnected from the live servers in the middle of your adventures or having to wait in short queues to get play during a particularly busy time, the benefits far exceed the drawbacks. There\u2019s a much greater sense of discovery now as you encounter other players out in the wild (or murder them in cold blood in a PvP zone), and those chance encounters when you\u2019re taking down a world boss, for example, can turn into new online friends. It\u2019s especially cool that trading and clans seem to have greatly increased in prominence compared to previous Diablo games, and there\u2019s a real sense of community around taking down endgame group activities together and helping one another optimize your builds. That\u2019s the kind of magic you can get in an online game and I\u2019m very excited to see what ridiculous shenanigans the community gets into. Optimizing your build and coordinating with your squad means nothing if there aren\u2019t endgame activities waiting to be conquered, and Diablo 4 has quite possibly the best day-one endgame experience I\u2019ve seen. Once you\u2019ve beaten the campaign, you\u2019ll be able to run bounties for the Tree of Whispers, an evil plant with dismembered heads hanging from it, which spawns new activities infinitely in exchange for high-level loot drops. Doing so at higher world tiers (essentially harder difficulties) also gives you keys to Nightmare Dungeons, which are more challenging versions of existing levels that add crazy stuff like an invincible crystal that magically chases you around the entire time trying to crush you and your dreams while you fight suped-up versions of the dungeon\u2019s enemies and bosses. PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail. \u201c I was around level 43 when I finished the campaign, but at level 50, you\u2019ll also be ready to tackle the first Capstone Dungeon \u2013 a mostly by-the-numbers dungeon that serves as a power and skill check in order to unlock the third world tier, and which grants access to a variety of new activities and loot drop ranks. Some of those are called Helltide Events, a completely awesome type of activity where blood begins raining from the skies in certain zones, and uber-deadly enemies swarm everywhere. Killing them and collecting nonsensically named Aberrant Cinders without dying allows you to open special chests that are positively crammed with sacred loot. But PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail. You\u2019ll find two PvP zones in Sanctuary where you compete to slay NPC enemies to collect materials while keeping your head on a swivel to defend against rival players who might decide to kill you and take your resources for themselves. Running around in these chaotic zones is completely nerve-wracking and hilarious, especially since even your own party members can betray you by scooping up the valuable materials that are not shared between players, leading to rifts in even the strongest alliance \u2013 you might even be tempted to leave the party to rid yourself of that pesky friendly fire protection and lash out at a former ally. Then at level 70, you get another Capstone Dungeon to unlock the final world tier, which gives you access to even better loot, tougher enemies, and more XP, and, there\u2019s yet another final endgame dungeon designed for level 100 characters after that \u2013 the treadmill of things to conquer is so well designed I didn\u2019t want to get off even when I felt like I had seen 95% of what was on offer. The whole time you work towards the max level of 100, you\u2019re earning Paragon points to make your character ever more deadly against your increasingly formidable foes, which serve as a carrot to keep grinding your way through Tree of Whisper Bounties, Helltide Events, and PvP zones. Even after more than 80 hours on my primary character I haven\u2019t reached level 100 yet, but there is a cap on both leveling and earning additional Paragon points once you do, a smart move away from Diablo 3\u2019s philosophy of letting players earn nigh-endless stat increases in favor of a system that forces you to make meaningful choices with the limited upgrades your Paragon Boards can contain. I prefer that approach to the bloated monsters that Diablo 3 characters were known to become, and the endgame grind to reach that max level is practically perfect in terms of variety, replayability, buildcrafting, and more. Microtransaction Reaction The retail version of Diablo 4 will include a digital store where players can spend real-world money on cosmetic items for their in-game characters, as well as a battle pass with both free and paid tiers of rewards. Unfortunately, these weren\u2019t available in the review build we were given access to, so we don\u2019t know the specifics of what items will be sold, how much they will cost, or if they\u2019ll even look interesting enough to be worth the price. Blizzard has at least clearly stated that the online store will only contain items that are purely cosmetic, with no impact on actual gameplay, and will include a small selection at first which will be expanded in future seasons, but for now that\u2019s all we know. That means there isn\u2019t necessarily a ton of cause for alarm at the moment, but we won\u2019t know for sure if there are any problematic aspects hiding in these systems until we are able to see them for ourselves at launch. Even if you somehow run out of things to do in the endgame for one character, rolling a second or third character instantly becomes a fresh experience since the campaign is optional and many unlocks like Altars of Lilith (fonts of power hidden throughout Sanctuary) and potions/skill points granted from gaining renown in regions of the map are account-wide bonuses that instantly apply to your character. The most important of these instant unlocks is your mount, which allows your new characters to hop on a horse and race off to faraway parts of the map so you can begin leveling by playing whichever activities you want, rather than being stuck to the campaign\u2019s railroad tracks every time you want to try out a new class. Tackling dungeons or participating in PvP from the fresh perspective of a whole new class immediately shakes off any dust Diablo 4\u2019s lengthy grind might gather and extends the good times even further than I thought possible. How many people do you plan to play through Diablo 4 with? I'm playing solo! Two Three A full squad of four! Whoever is online at the time Answer See Results The best part about Diablo 4\u2019s endgame successes, though, is that all of it\u2019s built upon a live-service foundation that will allow the world, meta, and activities to evolve over time. Whether or not that model will be updated with content frequently enough to keep people interested remains to be seen, but even without it, the vanilla endgame experience is strong enough on its own. I can only imagine how exciting it\u2019ll be when new experiences are added to the Diablo 4 playground that challenge your maxed out characters in exciting ways and expand upon the story or available character classes. Live-service games get a lot of hate nowadays, and I understand why when there are so many recent examples of how not to do them (I\u2019m looking at you, CrossfireX). But that model can also breathe endless life into a game when done right \u2013 we don\u2019t know yet if Blizzard will do it justice, but right now I couldn\u2019t be happier that the groundwork has at least been well laid for Diablo 4 to potentially thrive going forward. Diablo 4 Tips from IGN Guides For help with everything Diablo 4, take a look at our Diablo 4 Walkthrough and Guide . Our experts recommend you start here: Diablo 4 Interactive Map Beginner's Guide: Tips for Starting Diablo 4 What Diablo 4 doesn't tell you Diablo 4 Class Guides Hopefully some of those updates come sooner rather than later, too, as Diablo 4 does suffer from a few nasty bugs at the moment. For example, if you enjoy teleporting around as a sorcerer, be prepared to get stuck in the ground literally hundreds of times, as Blizzard apparently didn\u2019t account for vertical geometry changes when zipping around the top-down levels. Thankfully the issue can be resolved by just teleporting back to town, but it also forced me to retrace my steps to my original location, wasting tons of time\u2026only for it to happen again when I teleported a few minutes later. There\u2019s also some weird rubberbanding that sometimes goes on when you try to go from one region to another that prevents you from entering a zone. In some instances, my friends and I had to use one another as teleporting waypoints to get into regions we were completely unable to enter. Most of Diablo 4\u2019s issues are extremely specific things that will likely get patched, but they were bad enough to tangibly impact my enjoyment a bit in the meantime."

        "Content": "Remember when Street Fighter 5 came out and a lot of people were disappointed by its distinct lack of meat on its bones? Street Fighter 6 is the polar opposite. Complete with an excellent 18-character roster of both new and returning fighters rendered in a killer new art style, an incredibly ambitious online Battle Hub that puts all other online fighting game lobby systems to shame, and just about everything you could ever ask for when it comes to training tools and systems to help you get better at fighting games, it\u2019s a spectacularly feature-rich fighting game. Street Fighter 6 takes many swings in many different directions, and though not every blow connects, the ones that do are absolute knockouts. The gameplay of every Street Fighter game since Street Fighter 2 can generally be defined by a unique mechanic. Street Fighter 3 had parries, 4 had focus attacks, 5 had the V-System, and now Street Fighter 6 has the Drive System. And for my money, it\u2019s the best the series has ever seen. Street Fighter 6 Screens 32 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. Overdrives are essentially the new EX Special Moves and cost two bars, Drive Rush allows you to quickly close the distance between you and your opponent at the cost of one bar (or cancel out of specific normal attacks at the cost of three bars), Drive Reversals allow you to get an opponent off of you while you\u2019re blocking their attack at the cost of two bars, and Drive Impacts\u2026 well we\u2019ll get into those in a bit. I love this system for a lot of reasons, but chief among them is that it opens up so many options, and at the start of every round you have a full meter and have access to all of them. There\u2019s no building this meter up, or worrying about the amount you\u2019ll have left over for the next round. I could start aggressively by using a Drive Rush right out of the gate to put on pressure; I could save my meter for Overdrive special moves to increase the damage of my combos; or I could fish for a crouching medium kick and then Drive Rush cancel it to convert big damage off of a single hit. Those are just a few of the options, and managing them makes the already extremely cerebral fighting of Street Fighter 6 even more enjoyable. Managing your Drive Meter makes the already cerebral fighting even more enjoyable. \u201c The way it\u2019s handled when you run out of Drive Meter is also excellent: your character enters a Burnout state where you\u2019re completely unable to use any Drive Meter-related techniques; your opponent\u2019s attacks become more advantageous on both block and hit; you take chip damage, and Drive Impacts are even scarier than before (I swear, we\u2019ll get to Drive Impacts in just a bit). Being in Burnout is a terrible position, but it is far from an unwinnable situation. You still move at the same speed, your attacks do the same damage, you still have access to all of your super moves, and while your opponent\u2019s Drive Impacts are a huge threat, you know that they\u2019ll be looking to do them, which can lead to some interesting mind games on both sides. Some of the most tense and fun matches I\u2019ve had in Street Fighter 6 have been when I managed to pull out a victory even while in Burnout. Now let\u2019s talk about Drive Impact, because I have a feeling that for a lot of people, whether or not they enjoy Street Fighter 6 is largely going to come down to their feelings on this one move. Drive Impact only costs one bar of drive meter to use, it has super armor that can absorb up to two hits, and if it hits while your opponent is in the middle of their own attack they will be knocked into a crumpled state, giving you a full combo. And that\u2019s not at all! Even if they block it they get blown back and lose half a bar of Drive Meter, and if they get backed into the corner you get to follow it up with a combo. That\u2019s not all either! Remember how I said that they\u2019re even more scary when you\u2019re in Burnout? Well, if you block a Drive Impact and you\u2019re close to the wall you get stunned and you\u2019ll eat a full combo in the corner, even though you blocked their attack. It\u2019s one of the most powerful universal mechanics I\u2019ve ever seen in a fighting game, and if you don\u2019t respect it, you will get crushed by it. And yet, I love Drive Impacts, because they\u2019re tuned so that they\u2019re just reactable enough to be defended against if you\u2019re looking out for them, but also still fast enough to catch you by surprise if you\u2019re not. All you have to do is Drive Impact them right back: you\u2019ll absorb their attack, hit with yours, and now the roles have reversed so that you get the opportunity for a full combo. Countering Drive Impacts is just so incredibly satisfying, especially when it\u2019s the key to you turning the tables and winning a tight round. The New World Warriors Street Fighter 6\u2019s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12 returning characters and six being entirely new, but even the returning characters feel fresh thanks to new quirks added to their move sets. Ken\u2019s command run, for example, now changes up the properties of several of his special moves when he uses them out of it, giving them EX-like properties without having to spend Drive Meter on them; Cammy can now charge her special moves and give them V-Trigger like qualities; and Dee Jay has a ton of new feints that make him an extremely tricky character to use and play against. The new blood, meanwhile, are some of the best additions Street Fighter has seen. Kimberly is a clear standout, with a ninja-inspired moveset that has her closing the distance with quick teleports, piledriving you into the ground with Izuna drop-like air throws, and mixing you up with tricky leaps from half a screen away. Jamie, meanwhile, is a drunken melee powerhouse who is able to buff himself by taking swigs of his flask, and once he takes four drinks pretty much all of his moves become extremely dangerous with multi-hitting attacks that left me totally clueless on when it was actually my turn to try and fight back until I labbed against him in training mode. Which Newcomer to Street Fighter 6 Are You Most Excited About? Jamie Kimberly Lily Manon JP Marisa Answer See Results Pretty much every Street Fighter character archetype has representation here. You\u2019ve got your grapplers in Zangief and Manon; your rushdown fighters in Ken, Jamie, and Cammy; your zoners with Guile, Dhalsim, and JP; and your powerhouse bruisers in Marissa and Honda. It\u2019s everything I want out of a roster. Gonna Take You For a Ride World Tour is an ambitious single-player mode, and while it is a big step up from Street Fighter 5\u2019s attempt at a cinematic story mode (and anything else Street Fighter has done before) it\u2019s certainly the weakest part of Street Fighter 6. It\u2019s at least a great idea: It\u2019s a surprisingly enormous RPG that allows you to take a created character into the world of Street Fighter, interacting with the playable roster by becoming their disciple and learning their moves, and then building them up from scratch by leveling up, equipping various types of stat-altering gear, and selecting powerful skills. It also does a good job of teaching new players the fundamentals of Street Fighter 6 by including lessons as sidequests, with steadily increasing difficulty over the course of about 20 hours. However, RPGs live and die by their stories, and the story of World Tour is unbelievably dull. With paper-thin characters, predictable plot twists, and a mute protagonist whose main purpose is just to be an errand boy for various gangs and factions, there\u2019s nothing to get excited about. It feels like it was written with the primary purpose of having your character jump around to various countries to meet the roster characters, and yet it never really bothers to justify those trips. In one chapter, a random gangster all of sudden tells me that I need to get her bag back that my buddy stole. And so without any objection, the most reasonable solution is for me to make a global trip to Rome in order to fashion a counterfeit bag that I can hopefully use to fool the gangster into thinking I got her bag back. In another chapter I had to go to Jamaica and Brazil because my original mentor, Luke, wanted souvenirs from those places and doesn\u2019t know how to shop online I guess?

Log in to track which ones you've played, finished, or want to add to your backlog.

Street Fighter II Pinball Capcom Super Street Fighter II: The Tournament Battle Capcom Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers Capcom At least the tone is goofy and fun, which is a great fit for Street Fighter. You can fight just about anyone on the street, regardless of whether they deserve a Rising Uppercut to the face or not; it\u2019s fun to use ridiculous-looking moves like the Spinning Bird Kick to cross gaps like you\u2019re a human helicopter, and there\u2019s a surprising amount of enemy variety, many of which do an admirable job of teaching newer players how to deal with specific situations that will come up outside of story mode. Some enemies will favor blocking high, making them vulnerable to low attacks; others will stay permanently in the air and must be brought down by anti-air techniques; and others still will try to hang back and pepper you with projectiles, forcing you to fight them like you would a zoner-type character. And then you can also fight refrigerators\u2026 And Roombas. It\u2019s weird, but in a very amusing, Yakuza-esque kind of way. There\u2019s also a variety of fun minigames that do a great job of \u201cgamifying\u201d techniques that you actually would use in a typical fight. In one of them you have to chop bottles by holding back for a second and then quickly moving the stick in the opposite direction and pressing a button, which is how you\u2019d perform charge-type special moves on a character like Guile or Blanka; another has you making pizza by quickly performing special move inputs as they appear on screen; and another still has you using your combos to quickly destroy a big rig in a nod to the original car-busting minigame from Street Fighter 2. The best thing about World Tour is outfitting your character with moves from every fighter. \u201c The best thing about World Tour, though, and the thing that really serves as the carrot at the end of the stick, is the promise of being able to outfit your character with moves from every other fighter. By the end of the campaign I could use Dhalsim\u2019s teleport to instantly appear behind an opponent, hit them with Zangief\u2019s Spinning Piledriver, and then use Ken\u2019s Dragonlash Kick to get right back up in their face. Being able to customize my character in ways that would make them absolutely broken in the real game is a lot of fun. The issue is that it takes forever to level up a character\u2019s style to the point where you learn new moves from them. You do this simply by using them, but even though I only used Luke\u2019s and Ken\u2019s throughout the entire mode, I still didn\u2019t max out either of them. Those who love a good grind may enjoy having plenty left over to unlock after the 20 or so hours it takes to complete World Tour, but I would've liked the drip feed of new unlocks to be substantially faster considering the sheer amount of rewards there are to unlock by maxing out the ranks of each character. I have many more issues with World Tour, but even despite them, I still had a fun time with it in the end. It\u2019s a mode that\u2019s more directly aimed toward people without a lot of fighting game experience, and I think those people will get a ton more out of it than I did. The character customization elements are great, the way it incentivizes fundamental lessons of how to play Street Fighter 6 by dressing them up as side missions and minigames is extremely well done, and there\u2019s just an overwhelming amount of content to discover with two very large open worlds to explore (both of which have day and nighttime versions that each have their own set of side-missions to discover). I Got Next Another reason why you might want to go through World Tour mode is that you\u2019re able to take your character and all the gear they\u2019ve earned into the online Battle Hub, which is an online social space where you queue into both ranked and unranked matchmaking, or pull up on a cabinet much like you would in a local arcade and await challengers. Online lobbies are not a new thing in the world of fighting games, and truthfully, I\u2019ve never been the biggest fan of them, but Street Fighter 6\u2019s implementation of the Battle Hub has won me over. For one, it\u2019s super cool to look at because Street Fighter 6\u2019s character creator is absolutely wild, and gives you the freedom to make beautiful creations with finely tuned features or unspeakable monsters with out of this world bodily proportions, and it\u2019s fun to just wander around the hub and see what people have come up with. What DLC Character Are You Most Excited About? Rashid Ed A.K.I Akuma Answer See Results There\u2019s also a lot of things to do beyond just parking at a cabinet playing with either friends or random players. There\u2019s a section of the hub where you can play a rotating selection of classic Capcom games like Final Fight and Street Fighter 2; another section where you can play Extreme Battles with party-like rule sets and gimmicks; a store where you can purchase more customizable clothes for your avatar with in-game currency; and you can even pit your created character against others in Avatar Battles. But the most important thing about Battle Hub is that it\u2019s all optional. If you don\u2019t want to deal with it, you don\u2019t have to. You can simply queue up for ranked or casual matches via a menu, go into training mode while you wait, or create a custom room for multiple friends without ever having to go through the Battle Hub \u2013 which is exactly how it should be. The Little Things What really pushes Street Fighter 6 over the edge is how it completely nails virtually everything outside of its main modes that you could ask for in a fighting game. Based on my experience playing pre-launch and in all three betas, including the open beta, its netcode is excellent; it\u2019s got the best training mode I\u2019ve ever seen in a fighting game, complete with frame data and cancel window data; it\u2019s got extremely helpful character guides that make it very easy to learn a new character from scratch; combo trials that teach you practical combos for a variety of situations; load times are extremely quick and rematches are nearly instantaneous; you can search for replays with a ton of different filters to help you learn matchups; there\u2019s crossplay across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC; you can create and join clubs; and so on. Many fighting games also have these features, but very few have all of them, and especially not right out of the gate. Street Fighter 6 also deserves credit for really making an effort to welcome newcomers in innovative ways. On top of the World Tour mode, there\u2019s also a new Modern control scheme that allows you to play without having to worry about character-specific command inputs or combo routes. Special moves are mapped to a button and a direction, much like Smash Brothers \u2013 there\u2019s one button each for light, medium, and heavy attacks, you can execute combos by holding down an assist button and mashing one of the three attack buttons, and you can use super moves just by pressing two buttons at the same time. Street Fighter 6 Character Customisation - Tokyo Game Show 2022 7 Images The playing field is kept even by the fact that those using Modern Controls don\u2019t have access to a character\u2019s full repertoire of normal moves, but being able to perform special moves with just the press of a button is a tradeoff that makes the Modern Control style appealing even for those who aren\u2019t beginners. And for those who just want to hold forward and mash on one button to execute special moves and combos, there\u2019s a new Dynamic control scheme that\u2019s only usable offline and essentially lets the AI choose the attacks for you. Capcom\u2019s really covered all the bases here."

Each of its maps is simple enough to be solved in about 10 to 20 minutes, yet they never stop toying with elements of platformers, dipping into real-time strategy, stealth-action, and even arcade shooting at times.

It\u2019s a puzzle game from the minds behind Tetris Effect and Rez at Enhance Games, which explains why it\u2019s so bizarre and cool looking.

No, the thin story doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2013 it\u2019s not a big focus, just like in Rez. But Humanity does loosely point to some interesting metaphors about human nature, and this somehow works to explain some of its wildest moments. \u2026Don\u2019t ask about that one.

Trial and error is fun when messing up is this entertaining. \u201c That means running and jumping around the map yourself, placing commands like Turn, Jump, Shoot, and so forth. I had heaps of fun watching my initial strategies and mechanisms fail until I miraculously figured things out each time I progressed to the next level, because trial and error is fun when messing up is this entertaining. It\u2019s great that you can restart a map at any time without resetting your existing commands \u2013 that lets me rethink my steps at an iterative level without throwing all of my progress away after each mistake. What's your favorite 3D puzzle game? Portal/Portal 2 The Witness The Talos Principle Antichamber Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results There\u2019s a good bit of action too, in that sometimes you need to run around a map like a manic puppy and change the commands you\u2019ve already placed as certain conditions are met; for example, in one level, I organized a group of humans to push a block into place while another group pushed a separate block, working together to create a pathway so that both groups could jump across to escape an encroaching swarm of enemies. That\u2019s just one example, but it illustrates the basic premise of Humanity and how each of its intermingling systems gives way to a seemingly limitless number of challenges. Many of Humanity\u2019s individual scenes are jaw-dropping. \u201c Playing as a Shiba Inu works remarkably well here, especially given that your small stature and quick movement grant you the ability to slyly weave between groups of humans, dashing and leaping and even using your own minions to catapult yourself through the crowds. This all feels great in action, and with the DualSense controller thumping and pulsating in my hands, it all came together beautifully. It\u2019s wild to see potentially thousands of individual people flying across my television or inside my VR headset at once, and many of Humanity\u2019s individual scenes are jaw-dropping. That\u2019s both due to the bewildering technical wizardry of managing this crowd and the way that it uses strikingly imaginative scenes to burn each moment of satisfaction into my brain. One early puzzle had me creating my own state machine, a logical mechanism made up of thousands of individual humans jumping around between four platforms in an infinite loop, stepping over pressure plates. That allowed me to send a separate group climbing up a ledge and jumping their way to safety. Humanity Screenshots 14 Images You\u2019d think that so many moving bodies running around on-screen at once would get confusing or even nauseating, but Humanity\u2019s camera system is handled so well both in and out of VR that you almost always have control of what you\u2019re viewing. When you need to zoom in for a closer look or zoom out to get a bigger picture, it\u2019s smooth and simple to adjust your view to focus where you need to. Sometimes these infinite loops keep going even after you\u2019ve hit the victory screen, allowing you to revel at the literal gravity of your own problem-solving abilities. Again, that\u2019s just one potential example of how these mechanics interlock to create interesting challenges, and frankly it was one of the simpler ones I ran into. Humanity\u2019s open-endedness means it almost never slows down or grows repetitive, and figuring out each of its many clever puzzles feels like a completely new experience that is uniquely satisfying each time. That\u2019s especially true given how challenging they can be if you don\u2019t look at the conveniently included Solution Videos that help you with basic solutions but never go overboard or spoil any secrets, like how to unlock the optional objectives on any given map. Those secret objectives are the backbone of Humanity\u2019s progression system, and you need to unlock a certain number of them in each act to progress. You can\u2019t just do the bare minimum of getting your humans from point A to point B and expect a pat on the head; this game demands a little more thought from you. But it was never a drag since they were never overly tricky to find or unlock, usually just adding extra layers of satisfactory challenge while giving more experience points along the way. Just knowing that the way I solved a level isn\u2019t necessarily the only way adds a ton of replayability. You can\u2019t just do the bare minimum of getting your humans from point A to point B and expect a pat on the head. \u201c There\u2019s a nifty progression system that levels you up as you complete side objectives, and it unlocks timely rewards like new cosmetics for your human minions and even new gameplay features such as the ability to speed up time \u2013 or visit a hidden stats page from the menu that tells you exactly how many humans have spawned across your entire journey. The best part of all that is you can use those same rewards when you eventually start creating your own puzzles and maps \u2013 which you can share with the world at the press of a button. If you play enough custom maps or get your own levels upvoted enough in the User Stages mode, you\u2019ll gain XP in a set of totally separate progression systems that feel complementary but not at all necessary. You\u2019ll gradually unlock cooler avatars for social clout, but these systems wisely avoid affecting gameplay. In any case, the User Stages mode is already filled with interesting levels that stretch Humanity\u2019s toolbox of mechanics well past the limits of what Enhance must\u2019ve thought most people would be comfortable with in the main campaign, and it\u2019s easy to navigate directly to the best player-created levels through a handy indexing system. I could easily spend hours here, and I might have possibly even sidestepped the campaign altogether if I\u2019d discovered the User Stages mode first, but I\u2019m glad I played it as a tutorial for the super-advanced levels people are out there creating. And this is all made better by Humanity\u2019s VR compatibility, which will work with either PlayStation VR headset or PC VR. It\u2019s a perfectly viable way to play any level, though the VR Mode disappointingly hasn\u2019t been tooled to work with the Stage Creator tool itself quite yet. Still, I\u2019m delighted that Humanity gives you the option to enter a full-blown VR Mode from the main menu, placing you directly into the action \u2013 or you can stick to the PS VR2\u2019s Theater Mode and lay back on the couch and play on a virtual flat screen. Both modes play comfortably with the DualSense controller, though I wasn\u2019t quite as impressed when I tried it with the PS VR2\u2019s Sense controllers. They didn\u2019t feel like a natural fit, given that you\u2019re controlling a little dog with your thumbstick rather than doing anything with motion controls. Granted, that\u2019s a small issue when compared to the fact that I ran into almost no notable bugs minus one stray crash that happened in VR later on in my playthrough. Humanity also includes a brilliant vocal synth-driven score with some piano and other synthetic elements layered in that could only be described as a vibe . Its melodies are simple, repetitive, and sometimes even a bit silly, but each tune is appropriately relaxing, setting a gentle rhythm to brainstorm puzzles to. Even the relatively energetic bits of the soundtrack, namely during its boss fights, have a steady drone to them that make them sit comfortably in the background."

        "Content": "Root belongs to a small but burgeoning subgenre of tabletop board games where players immerse themselves in the woodland worlds of mice, racoons and other wild critters. For the most part, these are adventure-style games, heavy on narrative detail. But Root is different: behind its endearing exterior is a challenging conflict game in which four factions clash for control of their forest home. This really is nature red in tooth and claw. What\u2019s in the Box While Root comes in a relatively small box, it\u2019s heavy with content. There are three rulebooks: a quick-start walkthrough, a more verbose guide to the game in the box, and a full bullet-pointed rulebook which includes details for the game\u2019s many expansions. There are four different player boards, one for each faction, and the board itself which is double-sided and so offers two different maps to play on. Beneath all that cardboard are the game\u2019s compellingly cute components. First, a stack of cards illustrated in the unique, striking style of Kyle Ferrin: he\u2019s also responsible for the board and box art but it\u2019s on the cards that he truly shines, with characters and scenes in pen and ink that somehow manage to be both adorable and deadly serious at the same time.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That dichotomy is also captured by the bag of screen-printed pawns which use simple eyes-and-nose features in an astonishingly characterful way. There are three piles of pawns for the cats, birds, and woodland critters in the game plus a single fourth pawn, which evokes a racoon, for the vagabond. Some punch-out tokens and a pair of custom 12-sided dice, printed with 0-3 three times over, round out the contents. Rules and How it Plays At first glance, Root looks like a typical game of conflict and territory, where players are fighting to control portions of a map. And in some respects, it\u2019s exactly that. But it\u2019s far more novel than it may appear because it\u2019s a highly asymmetric game. Each player controls a faction which not only has a few special powers as you might see in a typical game of this style, but that essentially plays the game by its own, distinct rules. This takes some getting used to -- hence the helpful quick-start guide -- but the results are sublime. There are a few shared concepts that all the factions use. Players get cards each turn which must be \u201ccrafted\u201d in order to be played or which can be discarded to fuel certain effects. Everyone uses the same movement, control and combat system, which involves moving between board spaces and rolling two custom dice with the values 0 to 3. The attacker gets to use the highest dice and the result is the number of casualties inflicted on the enemy. Even this takes some getting used to but it\u2019s an interesting concept for a dice-rolling board game that really rewards aggression. Root is far more novel than it may appear because it\u2019s a highly asymmetric game. \u201c Beyond this, the factions diversify. The cats are the closest to a standard wargame, with a pool of actions they can use to build, move and attack, and they get points for defeating enemies and creating their own structures. The birds are also a conquest-based faction but they play very differently. Their faction has a \u201cdecree\u201d which indicates they must take certain actions in certain spaces, and you must add to the decree each turn. This can give them a huge pool of actions but if you fail to meet the dictates of the decree the result is disastrous, losing you points and forcing you to start a new decree from scratch. Pitting the cats against the birds is the recommended setup for a two-player game , and it makes for a fascinating face-off. On the one side, you have the familiar cats, seeking to gain territory and resources as they amass forces and creep across the map securing territory. On the other you have the birds, gathering speed and strength with each passing turn like some demented clockwork toy before crashing and starting over. The bird player must carefully plan his decree to make it achievable for as long as possible, while the cats balance their need for consolidation against the desire to mess up that decree by ensuring the birds can\u2019t take the necessary actions. The other two factions are even more peculiar. The Woodland Alliance is essentially an underground guerilla army made up of the disaffected critter peasantry. They can sacrifice cards to buy sympathy in a clearing which can, later, blossom into a revolt, destroying enemy forces there and adding the Alliance\u2019s own troops from their limited pool. Once established, incursions by other players into Alliance territory cause outrage, bolstering their cause despite the military setbacks. It\u2019s the dilemma faced by all powers struggling with insurgencies in microcosm, and it brings engrossing new dimensions to the strategy to see it portrayed in a relatively accessible manner alongside the clash of more regular forces. Our final faction is the Vagabond, a lone piece that plays more like a role-playing character, accumulating gear to build actions, than any kind of military force. They have the most complex rules and the most fluid palette of point-scoring. They can prosper by exploring old ruins and completing quests then, later in the game, will become friends or enemies with other factions in the game, scoring additional points by trading or attacking them respectively. Playing the Vagabond is a careful balancing act of predicting how the game will ebb and flow so you can support and annoy the right people while leaving yourself space to pursue individual goals. Root really shines with all four players. The military clashes between the birds and cats set the stage, while the Woodland Alliance and the Vagabond hide behind the curtain, trying to furtively pull together points. This dynamic feels very unusual, with the two armies fighting in a zero-sum game of tearing strips off each other while always looking over their shoulder lest they outrage alliance supporters or earn the enmity of the Vagabond. The result is a game that feels like a war board game , but one where the negotiation over alliances takes a back seat, letting mechanical strategy shine through without reducing player interaction, and earns a spot on our list of the best board games for adults . Getting to the point where you can fully enjoy the game, however, takes some effort. Learning one faction is fine, but you really need to know the rules for all the factions to plan your strategy well. To properly grasp things you ideally need to play all the factions, more than once, so you can understand the problems from the inside. And while the asymmetry in Root is fascinating it can also lead to some unfortunate games in which each faction feels like it\u2019s doing its own thing, and a leader can coast to victory without the other players being able to do much about it.

        "Content": "After putting in some major study sessions and passing its tests in 2019\u2019s Fire Emblem: Three Houses , Fire Emblem Engage makes the potentially surprising decision to take a purposeful step away from that focus on time management and teaching. Many base activities and socializing aspects with your team are still here, but Engage makes the smart move to adjust its sights back toward the roots of the series by putting engaging tactical combat first and foremost. There\u2019s a reverence for Fire Emblems past that is clear in every aspect of it, even including the spirits of legendary heroes from previous games that power up your team, which match the strategic depth they bring with an exciting visual flair every time they\u2019re unleashed. Its classic good vs. evil story may not reach those same heights of its predecessor, but the Divine Dragon\u2019s adventure still stands tall among its peers \u2013 both on its own merits and as a wonderful tribute to Fire Emblem\u2019s legacy. When Fire Emblem Engage first introduced the idea that twelve rings housed the spirits of protagonists of Fire Emblem\u2019s past, I\u2019ll admit I was a bit skeptical. (According to the story, they aren\u2019t actually the exact same heroes from other worlds \u2013 more like incorporeal manifestations that retain the knowledge and abilities of their hero's journey\u2026 or something). From Marth to Ike, Celica to Byleth, and plenty more, these legends will advise you, spar with you, and become your battle companions as you try to collect all 12 rings and defeat the big bad Fell Dragon who wants to corrupt them for nefarious purposes. While it\u2019s fun to see familiar faces, there were also plenty I didn\u2019t recognize, which had me worried about how much of the backstory of these heroes were going to be lost on me. Three come from games never officially released outside Japan, and several more have only been featured on the GameBoy Advance or similar decades-old Nintendo consoles \u2014 unless you count their inclusion in Smash Bros. or the mobile gacha game Fire Emblem Heroes . IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask And yet, over the course of my 60+ hour adventure, I found my worries to be unfounded. Fire Emblem Engage manages to celebrate its long history of compelling characters without making you feel left out if you\u2019ve never played through their stories firsthand. Your own character (a Divine Dragon whose name defaults to Alear) has a story that is still the driving force behind your journey in Engage, and while the Emblem Rings play an important role, it\u2019s one that does its best to stay within the context of your current adventure. Did I freak out a little when meeting Ike, the hero from Path of Radiance, since it was the Fire Emblem that really got me interested in the series? Yes, very much so. But even Emblems like Sigurd and Leif were a joy to fight alongside despite me knowing next to nothing about their respective stories. Whether it was offering helpful anecdotes to my character about the trials they faced, or granting me their power and skills to inherit in combat, they became the backbone of my army, and each new Emblem Ring I collected gave me new strategies to work with. Did I freak out a little when meeting Ike? Yes, very much so. \u201c The true talents of these Emblem Rings shine when taken into battle. Just having one equipped provides a host of passive bonuses and skills. Watching both my unit and their spectral Emblem Ring counterpart slice into foes at the same time was always great to see, even if the animations didn\u2019t actually translate to increased damage. Depending on which rings you use, the skills your team inherits abilities that range from the more mundane stat boosts to incredibly useful skills like attacking twice before opponents can respond, repositioning allies, or altering terrain effects to control the battlefield. All of this culminates in the ability to \u201cengage\u201d their true power for a short period, as your unit essentially fuses with the Emblem hero, gleaming with new shining white armor and inheriting that hero\u2019s hair color or style. These fused characters  also sport wild neon blue wings and other crazy effects that felt straight out of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u2019s Sheikah tech, making them unmissable standouts on the battlefield. Engaging also lets you temporarily equip extremely powerful or unique weapons \u2014 often giving units access to attacks they would normally never be able to use. Coupled with special \u201cEngage Skills\u201d that are only available for this brief period, it became a huge game changer for how I approached each mission. By engaging with the Emblem Lyn, my lance-wielding pegasus knight could suddenly become winged Death incarnate; able to launch an extremely powerful ranged salvo of arrows to out-snipe otherwise lethal archers, then fly in close to slice and dice with Lyn\u2019s signature katana, and even create illusory doubles to distract foes and counter with their own attacks. Engaging my units with their Emblem Rings became the highlight of every encounter, and the flashy ultimate attack animations were always worth watching. Since it can often take awhile to recharge this power, finding the perfect time to have one more more units engage to turn the tides always had me trying to plan my moves out in advance, as even the most powerful attacks could still leave my characters in danger if they got surrounded or overwhelmed without backup. There was no wrong answer for pairing up my teammates with different Emblem Rings \u2014 only a wealth of possibilities. \u201c Each Emblem Ring is unique enough that no two ultimate abilities feel the same: Some rely on single target or area-of-effect damage, while others work in support roles like sacrificing health to heal the rest of the team. Many of these abilities also have small but interesting modifiers depending on which unit type has the Emblem Ring equipped, adding even more layers of strategy and customization that I absolutely loved to experiment with. Because of this, there was no wrong answer for pairing up my teammates with different Emblem Rings \u2014 only a wealth of possibilities. My thief ended up becoming my natural choice for pairing with Emblem Corrin from Fire Emblem Fates, as her Dragon Vein ability added mist cover to the surrounding terrain when used by covert-type units, and the debilitating effects of Corrin\u2019s draconic aura skill was further bolstered by poisoning daggers. What We Said About Fire Emblem Three Houses Fire Emblem: Three Houses succeeds in its ambitious telling of a land at war helmed by captivating leaders, in which no side has all the answers. Its tense battles are made all the more harrowing thanks to new strategy elements, and the colorful cast of troops you send into the fray are incredibly charming. With a new take on training and bonding with your units, and the many activities and options available to sample, it\u2019s absolutely begging to be played multiple times. Score: 9.5 Read the full review Rock, Paper, Fist In addition to the larger changes Emblems introduce, Fire Emblem Engage has refined almost every aspect of its turn-based battles in smaller ways, too. Enhanced visuals have made each mission more pleasing to look at, UI improvements mean the action is easier to follow, and subtle new spins have been introduced to cornerstone combat mechanics. The classic weapon triangle has made its triumphant return after disappearing from Fire Emblem: Three Houses but its not content to simply return to the status quo: this time, using the right weapon like a lance against swords won\u2019t just translate into better accuracy and damage, as the new \u201cbreak\u201d mechanic can also disarm that opponent for the rest of the turn. Of course, your enemies can do the same to you, making the weapon triangle even more fearsome this time around. Even when certain defensive spaces let units become \u201cunbreakable,\u201d Engage provides an answer with a new heavy weapon type that can shove defenders backwards \u2013  of course, the smart trade-off for this powerful effect is that heavy weapons hit dead last regardless of how fast the other opponent is. Fire Emblem Engage Screens (Nintendo Direct - Sept 2022) 31 Images These new features are brought to life in a fun way thanks to Engage\u2019s expansive maps, which are quite similar to Three Houses. Battles zoom right down to the action (wonderfully transitioning the music to be more energetic) and look way more dynamic than they have in the past, as mighty attacks can send fighters flying backwards, even breaking apart fences or crates in the process. Watching someone miss an attack no longer feels like a pathetic whiff, as combatants will cleanly translate the numbers game into seamless parries and counter-attacks that feel way more like an active battle than two opponents just rolling the dice one at a time. My favorite new battlefield addition, by far, is the massive overhaul to the healer class. \u201c My favorite new battlefield addition, by far, is the massive overhaul to the healer class, which has melded them with martial artists to become \u201cQi Adepts\u201d. Healers in Fire Emblem have historically always been the weakest link, often requiring the most baby-sitting or being shunted to the back of the army \u2013 but no longer! While they still might not always be able to face down a knight or axe-wielding berserker, they can break the weapons of archers, mages, and thieves using punches and kicks. They can also guard another unit from the first incoming attack so long as the healer has full health. This became a recurring theme as enemy bosses would often have an entourage of Qi Adepts just waiting to take one for the team, requiring me to strategically wound them first before I could unleash my full force on the enemy leader. P.S. I Love UI Along with many other quality of life improvements, shortcuts, and settings, I can\u2019t get over how much Fire Emblem Engage has improved upon its interface when managing your team in battle. Even in the previous entry to the series, highlighting a unit would give you only a few details, forcing you to enter menus, selecting weapons or actions next to a single opponent before you could get a better idea of your odds in battle. In Engage, simply hovering over a unit will show you a wealth of information \u2013 including their Emblem Ring, list of weapons, skills, and important stats. Even better is the ability to quickly tell how much of a chance you\u2019ll stand against enemies simply by moving near them and seeing their health bar flash. If I wasn\u2019t satisfied with what I saw, tapping a button let me swap between my available weapons to see how their health bar would react, or even swap in and out of my supercharged engaged state to see how it would affect my chances \u2013 all without ever having to stop and commit to menus or confirm my attack on the enemy. Now that I\u2019ve spent time with these incredibly useful features, it\u2019s hard to imagine playing Fire Emblem without them. Ringbearers Where Fire Emblem: Three Houses thrust you into dramatic conflict between rival nations and eventually forced you to fight against the very friends you\u2019d bonded with, Fire Emblem Engage dials things back a bit, for better and for worse. Its story is a classic tale of ancient evils re-awakening, amnesiac protagonists, and various nations uniting under a common banner for good. I\u2019ll admit, I wasn\u2019t quite sold on Alear and their Aquafresh toothpaste hair design, but I got over that fairly quickly \u2013 perhaps when you\u2019re stacked against the various blue-haired guys and gals of Fire Emblems past, you gotta stand out any way you can. In truth, what really turned me around was finally having a fully voiced Fire Emblem protagonist (and allowing the past heroes to be voiced as well). The three-pronged story of the last Fire Emblem is a tough act to follow, but having a main character who does more than stare blankly at people during cutscenes and conversations went a long way. It helps sell many of Engage\u2019s plot points, from the growing bonds between Alear and their friends to some insidious plans enacted by the Fell Dragon and his minions. While not every twist or reveal hit its mark, I was generally surprised by some very late game developments that affected more than just the immediate story. I wasn\u2019t quite sold on Alear and their Aquafresh toothpaste hair design, but I got over that fairly quickly. \u201c You\u2019ll gain a host of quirky allies at a reasonable pace along your journey to collect all the Dragon Ba\u2026 I mean Emblem Rings. Normally I\u2019d be a bit skeptical at how almost everyone is all too eager to pledge their service to Alear\u2019s quest, but I guess when you\u2019ve been worshiped as divinity during your centuries-long slumber, people are just happy to see you awake and slaying evil at last. I also found myself impressed at how Engage handled padding out the acquisition of the rings. Some clever ideas kept me from getting too overpowered too fast, while giving me just enough Emblem Rings to respect the power they added to my army. Even more humbling was learning what could happen when the enemy used the power of Emblem Rings against me. Boss fights in Fire Emblem have usually been tense standoffs where a wrong move could lead to one of your favorite characters getting demolished \u2013 but even in that context Engage had me double and triple-checking the skills and abilities of my adversaries before putting one foot into their lair. Using an Emblem\u2019s power to teleport across the map and explode some poor sucker with the Ragnarok tome is a ton of fun \u2014 but when it happened to me it was downright terrifying. The various missions and maps in Engage tested my strategic knowledge in different ways, and it was fairly common for battles to last more than half an hour as I carefully considered my path forward (or sometimes rewound time by a turn or two if I realized my path was leading to certain death for a few characters). Most chapters usually end with defeating a boss, and the way these bosses are handled has left me feeling a bit conflicted. Not far into your journey you\u2019ll meet the main executors of the big bad\u2019s will: The Four Hounds. They all have different personalities and reasons for being on Team Evil, and made for some challenging opponents, but problems arose when I found that they kept coming back for more. I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019d have to fight these lackeys, beating them to a pulp only to have them laugh it off in the ensuing cutscene, swearing revenge for next time like a cartoon villain. And my army would just\u2026 watch them saunter off. Again, and again. I don\u2019t even think they were bad characters, as some late game developments did a great job to make me understand them more \u2013 I just really wish Engage had at least tried to offer a passable excuse for why I let them get away so many times. I\u2019d even be okay with an overly convenient teleportation spell! Fire Emblem Engage - All the Emblem Ring Heroes 12 Images Even when facing the otherwise decently varied enemy commanders, I still found myself waiting for developer Intelligent Systems to get bold enough to stop relying on \u201cdefeat the enemy boss\u201d as the main objective for the bulk of its 26 chapters. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t too big of an issue, as the maps themselves would often involve some inventive hazards or features that I couldn\u2019t just charge through \u2013 like changing tides on the beach limiting movement, or obstructions that I could have an easier time dealing with if I had the right Emblem Ring equipped on a unit nearby. When the missions did occasionally change their objectives, things would often get a little harrowing, and one tense chapter in particular that had me on the run did a superb job of making escape feel like it was truly my only option instead of recklessly standing my ground. Some of my favorite missions didn\u2019t even come from the main chapters. \u201c Some of my favorite missions didn\u2019t even come from the main chapters, as Fire Emblem Engage offers some very interesting takes on paralogue side missions. These challenging encounters revolved around trials to defeat the heroic Emblems in combat, and within these trials are some of the best homages to Fire Emblem\u2019s history. Each trial takes place on a map that\u2019s almost directly lifted from a previous game in the series, and often includes hazards, ambushes, or mechanics from that exact mission. I still believe you won\u2019t feel left out if you haven\u2019t experienced the stories of past Fire Emblems, but those who have will be treated to some very faithfully adapted pivotal moments in time. Moments like Ike taking command of his father\u2019s mercenary company, or Byleth defending the Throne of Knowledge from the theft of its relics. Missions like these, coupled with the care that went into creating skills and abilities for each Emblem Ring that are both fun to use and provide great callbacks, ring with the same reverent tone as when Nintendo expertly adapts fighters into the Super Smash Bros series. Even the music for these side missions are uniquely arranged medleys from previous soundtracks, providing new energetic or dramatic twists on some of my favorite Fire Emblem music. I\u2019m doubly glad I was then able to set these music tracks to play during other side skirmishes, because honestly, even after spending more than 60 hours clearing the story and paralogue missions \u2014 I can\u2019t get enough of them. Up On Cloud Nine Between fights, you can move around the world map at will, opening up new locations for main missions as you progress, while randomly backfilling previously completed maps with random encounters to gain more experience, money, and materials. This system is much more satisfying to navigate than simply looking at a list to pick my next task, and the option to fast travel directly to a map point or back to my base made things quick and easy. You can even explore the maps you beat in a neat post-battle exploration. It doesn\u2019t really bring anything huge to the table as you have limited actions, but I appreciated being able to enjoy the scope and scale of certain locations I\u2019d fought in \u2013 like vibrant palace throne rooms or viewing impossibly-sized statues guarding expansive bridges strewn with barricades. Plus, this activity gives you time to check in with your team for some quick chats, even letting some of the units you didn\u2019t take with you into battle have their chance to add their thoughts, which made me feel like my entire army was still tagging along and not just stuck at home bored to tears.

A special floating island called The Somniel instead focuses on both managing your team and keeping up with socializing and bonding, but in ways that aren\u2019t as drawn out and time-consuming as those featured in Three Houses (though I am a bit surprised having tea with your friends didn\u2019t make the cut here). You can still partake in fishing, cooking meals to enjoy with friends, and sparing for a bit of extra experience \u2013 plus a few new hit-or-miss activities like strength training exercises or petting this weird dopey cat thing that I immediately put sunglasses on, though all are completely optional. I do wish there were a few more direct ways to bond with another teammate. \u201c Having my character go to sleep also became super optional once I realized random allies would just wander into my bedroom to wake me up in really weird sequences \u2013 it\u2019d be cool if we could establish some boundaries on The Somniel! Still, it was nice to see my team enjoy their downtime, whether working out, swimming, dining, or just generally relaxing, rather than having everyone awkwardly stand around until we left for the next mission. Although, I do wish there were a few more direct ways to bond with another teammate besides eating a meal or getting the same old gifts to give en masse. When I found some horse manure on the ground to give away as a joke gift, I thought it was a little funny. Finding more and more poop that was added to my inventory each time I came back to explore my base\u2026 not as much. The Somniel is also where you can manage the Emblem Rings you\u2019ve collected, and there\u2019s a surprising amount to do with them \u2013 perhaps even too much. In addition to utilizing skills from an active Emblem Ring, you can also spend points to inherit skills from other rings. This encourages lots of customization and passing rings around so everyone can make use of them, and I had a lot of fun planning out the perfect set of skills for everyone to eventually inherit, though the sheer number of skills and point values can sometimes become a bit of a headache. You can also create smaller stat-boosting rings for your units who don\u2019t have their own Emblem Ring yet through a system that strongly resembles the Fire Emblem Heroes gacha game, with an assortment of tiers for each ring and the ability to meld duplicates into better versions. Certain rings may even have a really useful skill at their highest tier \u2013 but only if you get really lucky creating a bunch of rings, or you\u2019re prepared to shell out a lot of in-game currency. (Never fear, though, as there is no option for real-money microtransactions or anything like that here.) Every IGN Fire Emblem Review Ever 15 Images Together We Ride Perhaps the most surprising addition to The Somniel is a combat tower that lets you take on a variety of challenge missions \u2013 two of which feature neat asynchronous multiplayer options. Given how long people can take to move their units in a single turn, this might be the most well-realized multiplayer Fire Emblem can have, but it\u2019s not without a few hiccups. One mode allows you to fully customize one half of a map to either challenge another player\u2019s computer controlled team on their half of the map, or have your AI team defend against other opponents with the base you\u2019ve built. You can place everything from ballistas to breakable walls and healing tiles, and even give units a variety of orders to follow, though if you want to hit the upper limit for tiles to customize, you\u2019ll end up with a mish-mash of random objects that don\u2019t really let you set a theme for your base. This might be the most well-realized multiplayer Fire Emblem can have. \u201c The second mode is a clever attempt at Fire Emblem co-op: Relay Trials. One player starts a trial that must be completed in 10 turns, picking a small group of units to go up against a horde of enemies. The twist is that the initial player only has two turns to move their team before their time is up, at which point the data is uploaded and another player can then download that trial and pick up where the first player left off, potentially adding a few reinforcements of their own. Players who join get a fun and quick recap of the battle so far, then need to do their best to forge ahead and put a plan in motion to clear the map, even if they won\u2019t be around to finish it. I really love the idea of having to adapt to someone else\u2019s strategy mid-battle, pick the right reinforcements to help bolster any lacking defenses, and decide whether to utilize as many Emblem Rings as possible or hold off in engaging in case the next player may need them to get out of a bad situation. Players who have beaten the story can unlock a sort of \u201cpost game\u201d trial map which is a great way to keep the fun going \u2014 but it\u2019s the earlier players I worry about, thanks to some very vague matchmaking. Unlike offline trials, you can't really set a specific difficulty level, nor can you see one when Engage picks a  random relay trial for you to join (aside from maps being listed simply as Normal or Hard). Whoever starts the trial seems to set the bar for the level of the enemies within, which means you may find your reinforcements either under or over-leveled for the task at hand. I would have loved for a way to at least get an idea of how challenging the multiplayer battles were going to be so I could decide whether it was worth my time, instead of being thrown into the first result without an easy way to back out. Worse yet, it\u2019s possible to join a trial and find characters you haven\u2019t yet encountered on the team, which may spoil you to later reveals."

        "Content": "Feelings of glee and wonder not unlike walking into an arcade full of classic games befell me as I booted up Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, gawking at its wide and varied wonders. This collection offers a completely new, very fun way to explore several decades of Atari arcade machines, consoles, handhelds, and PCs. With no musty old, red museum ropes to restrain me ( only five of the 103 games require unlocking ), I found myself not just absorbing, but exploring the past \u2013 like that chunky pixel in Adventure for the Atari 2600 gliding through rainbow-colored castles. Experiencing history in Atari 50 is like nothing else I\u2019ve ever seen in any collection before, let alone a documentary, book, or a classroom. It\u2019s all of those things in one, and a lot more fun! If you\u2019ve played a recent game collection, you know what they are about: A list of emulated games, sometimes presented with new save options, control schemes, and other adaptations \u2013 and often a sampling of digitized extras, like scans of box art. Atari 50\u2019s creators, Digital Eclipse, are unparalleled collection creators. Their previous efforts, including the Mega Man Legacy Collection and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection came packed with art and unearthed design documents in addition to presenting very playable versions of emulated games. In Atari 50, the historical artifacts are not buried in an extras menu on the home screen. Here, the extras menu is a game itself . Presented as a branching timeline, a single point of interest might be a playable game, a short documentary, a slideshow, a scan, a quote, or an artifact, all adding to an irresistible completion percentage as you delve deeper. Atari 50 Screens 14 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask And what artifacts they are! Holograms from a canceled Atari handheld? Reproduced. A theatrical trailer for Yars\u2019 Revenge? Presented in all of its grainy glory. The entire code for Combat on the Atari 2600? It fits in a single screenshot (the file size of which is many times larger than the original code). Airworld, the missing final game in the Swordquest series of action-adventure cartridges with DC Comics tie-ins? Created from scratch by Digital Eclipse and included. The video game market crash of the 1980s interrupted the series finale so Digital Eclipse made a game to right that historical wrong . But What About The Games There\u2019s technically a better way to play many of these games, and that\u2019s on their original hardware. This is especially true for Atari in the 80s, who avoided joystick layouts almost entirely in their arcade games (e.g. Centipede\u2019s trackball, Asteroids\u2019 all-button control panel, Tempest\u2019s spinner) and got even weirder with their home consoles like the Atari 7800 and Atari Jaguar. But outside of a room full of restored hardware, such as a classic game convention or an arcade, there\u2019s no better context to play these games in than this collection. Games are discussed in a documentary, presented alongside design docs and art, and for each one you are given a reason, or several, to try it out. It\u2019s so much better than a folder of ROMs. And unlike the arcade games I mentioned above, some of these fare better in this format. I may be a stickler for getting classic arcade controls right, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of the Atari 2600 joystick \u2013 it stinks! I\u2019d rather play most of the console and PC games presented with smoothed-over controls mapped to modern D-pads and analog sticks. Atari 50\u2019s emulation has some but not all of the common, modern improvements seen in many collections: A single save state has been added for each game, controls can be remapped, a pretty good CRT-like filter can be enabled, bezels recreate art and fill out the wide screen. But you cannot rewind these games or watch and manipulate a perfect playthrough like we saw in 2022\u2019s Cowabunga Collection. I\u2019m surprised, since those specific features have become standard in Digital Eclipse collections and I believe they should become universally expected \u2013 but I also don\u2019t miss them here as much, due to the largely arcade-y nature of the game list (and that includes games beyond the arcade years, I think there\u2019s an Asteroids and/or a Missile Command on every Atari platform, many included here). 6 Must-Play Games The subjects of the documentaries in Atari 50 will tell you about the classics: Star Raiders, Tempest 2000, Yars\u2019 Revenge, and Warlords (four player!) are all very playable and presented well in this collection. But here are some weird and wonderful games you might not have thought to try, or simply couldn\u2019t before now: VCTR-SCTR (Reimagined) Designed by Digital Eclipse and housed in an actual arcade cabinet for the California Extreme 2022 arcade convention, this is a vector graphics-inspired mashup of several Atari games like Asteroids and Lunar Lander. It looks sleek and the transitions between levels are pure vector-like joy. Cloak & Dagger (Arcade) A ridiculous tie in to a 1984 movie of the same name, Cloak & Dagger only appeared as a rare kit to convert older games in arcades. It has amusingly weird cutscenes and an easy-to-understand, simplistic infiltration theme. Cool! Club Drive (Jaguar) Club Drive is a very early 3D polygon game (think Star Fox) and involves a kind of casual, open-world driving. It\u2019s a pretty remarkable tech accomplishment but also a fun foil to, say, Super Mario 64, which did 3D so much better just two years later. But did Super Mario 64 have 90s saxophone samples? Club Drive definitely does. Black Widow (Arcade) Black Widow is a twin-stick shooter like Robotron with goofy vector graphics. I adore this game. Dodge \u2018Em (2600) It\u2019s a simple concept: Two cars circle a track in opposite directions in a sort of chicken-meets-jousting match. It makes for a great two-player party game. Don\u2019t miss the amusingly overwrought packaging art of a mustachioed buggy driver being run off the road. Sure! Turbo Sub (Lynx) Created for the Atari Lynx portable system, Turbo Sub is a crazy, in-your-face first-person shooter. But not that kind of FPS \u2013 in this you are a submarine AND a plane! And you can freely dive and soar while meeting objectives. The list itself is dominated by Atari 2600 games (there are 40 of them) followed by arcade games (25), and the rest of the 103 total options are a mix from Atari consoles like the Atari 5200, 7800, and Jaguar, the handheld Lynx, and the Atari 400/800 PCs. Of these my favorites are all arcade games, but they also lose the most in emulation. With few exceptions, Atari 2600 games are hard for me to get excited about anymore. I\u2019ve played them all, they are very simple \u2013 and if they aren\u2019t simple, they require manuals, all thankfully provided here. I get their place in history, with wondrous creativity and programming tricks that make them so interesting, and that\u2019s exactly what the Atari 50 collection provides for your enjoyment and perhaps education. Atari 50 Collection Game Lineup Here are all the games included with 2022's 50th anniversary collection -- as well as the playable titles added for the Official The Wider World of Atari expansion/special edition. See All 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe Atari Inc. (1972-1984) Adventure Atari Inc. (1972-1984) Air-Sea Battle Atari Inc. (1972-1984) Akka Arrh [1982] Atari Asteroids Atari Inc.

Big Five Software I was most intrigued by the \u201cReimagined\u201d games, variants that are brand new to this collection, and some of the later Atari efforts, like the 3D Jaguar games. These did not disappoint\u2026 well, maybe some of them did; options like Cybermorph and Club Drive were and are disappointing games and commercial failures! But they are fascinating . 3D Jaguar games represent a pre- PlayStation or Nintendo 64 era that most people weren\u2019t privy to due to the limited interest in the Jaguar stunting its ubiquity. These Jaguar games are full of goofy, rough edges, but I greatly appreciate the chance to play them. License Revoked There are some sad but likely necessary omissions from the Atari 50 collection: Atari\u2019s masterpiece arcade game, Star Wars, and its vector sequel The Empire Strikes Back; Raiders of the Lost Ark for 2600; Alien vs Predator for the Jaguar. All of these, and many, many more beloved games based on popular licenses aren\u2019t included here. You get E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, so licenses weren\u2019t totally prohibitive, but the story of Atari is incomplete without the iconic pop culture-inspired games. These are sometimes acknowledged in the documentaries, but even the extras are devoid of a single piece of that glorious era when the Atari and Star Wars logos appeared alongside some of the coolest, high tech games of the time. MOAR GAMES? Here\u2019s a list of every game in the Atari 50 collection , arranged by platform \u2013 including how to unlock the 5 secret games. We reached out for comment on the possibility of adding games to the collection and Digital Eclipse provided the following statement\" We feel strongly that Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is a complete package that tells the story we want to tell and takes video game compilations in an exciting new direction. While we don't have anything to announce at this time as far as further Atari 50 content, we are definitely keeping all of our options open and exploring what's possible. Docs Deluxe A highlight of Atari 50 are interviews with Atari employees, devs, and other creators. There are some incredible pieces of footage of the Pong factory in the early 1970s, and interviews with Atari\u2019s founder Nolan Bushnell then and now. Long-standing, tall-seeming tales \u2013 like the first Pong machine prototype jamming up with quarters at a local bar or the laissez-faire attitude toward drug use in the Atari offices \u2013 are addressed in their own segments, presented as individual stories and impressions rather than definitive history. As the years progress, fewer people in the included documentaries are excited to talk about Atari, especially into the 1990s, and that era isn\u2019t nearly as well documented as the 1980s in this collection, which is a shame because it\u2019s not well documented overall. And while it\u2019s amazing to capture some of the most prominent voices from Atari\u2019s past, the selection of interview subjects is not fully representative of talent at the time. The Atari era boasted a number of prominent women developers, for example, but sadly none of them are featured in these documentaries  I would be interested to hear from other Atari contributors; Atari\u2019s art and marketing departments represented some of the company\u2019s greatest creativity, but their stories remain tantalizingly untold. Likewise, decades of journalists, historians, and collectors could have been tapped to add context that\u2019s missing here."

        "Content": "Successful sequels build on their predecessors in multiple ways \u2013 think Mass Effect 2 , Assassin's Creed 2 , and Uncharted 2 . They all improve what came before them by conjuring up exciting new gameplay mechanics, developing characters through engaging stories, and switching up mission design to offer variety. In other words, they take a solid base and combine with new elements to create more advanced bonds, much like an alloy\u2026 or in this case, an Aloy. Horizon Forbidden West does this with aplomb, building on the already impressive foundations of 2017\u2019s Horizon Zero Dawn to tell a thrilling story full of familiar explosive combat against elaborate robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, but also adding Witcher-like settlements to the map and filling it out with great side quests. There\u2019s a genuine sense of exploration and loads of completely involving lore behind it all to uncover. The result is a fantastic open-world action-adventure that, despite falling into a couple of its old habits, emphatically delivers on the promises made five years ago. The battle between the natural and firmly unnatural is everywhere to see in the Forbidden West. It drills down through many levels to what the Horizon series is all about, from the vines strangling the remains of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge to the animal-like man-made machines that wander the land, tracing the footsteps of their long-dead creators. But this clash also takes place inside Aloy, who (spoilers for the first game) herself is a complicated combination of human and synthetic life. It's what drives the plot along and lends a personal touch to what could be otherwise ungainly themes if handled without the obvious care that developer Guerrilla Games has put into Forbidden West. Horizon Forbidden West Screenshots 12 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Take the Power Back Once again, Aloy is on a time-sensitive mission packed with mystery, not least in its characters, many of whom are firmly established in the grey area between friend or foe. Its twists and turns are numerous and had me guessing how it would turn out right until the end of Aloy's journey. That journey isn't a short one; my playthrough (which was done at a fairly relaxed pace that included completing a healthy amount of side missions) took around 32 hours. Guerrilla has definitely learned a lesson this time around when it comes to finding a balance between worldbuilding and telling a coherent story. Horizon Zero Dawn tackled some big, ambitious ideas, but sometimes stumbled when it came to conveying them in an engaging way, with an over-reliance on audio and text files found in lifeless labs and abandoned offices. With the stage now firmly set, though, Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes fell victim to, (mostly) mercifully avoiding lengthy information dumps in favour of a more elegantly told tale. While there are still a decent amount of audio logs to find, the quality of them is much improved, and more importantly, this time around all of the story\u2019s key moments are told through engaging cutscenes that contain their fair share of character-centric drama without dwelling on it long enough to overstay their welcome. Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes fell victim to. \u201c This is still very much a hard sci-fi setting, though, and that is where the slightly weaker parts of Forbidden West\u2019s story lay during the opening hours. Sometimes it just can't help but stray into overlong monologues referring back to the events of Zero Dawn and the setup for the journey west, and that\u2019s where some momentum is lost. This makes for an uneven start, but the pace promptly picks up and becomes much more engaging once a new threat is introduced and the true plot of Forbidden West comes to the fore. From here on it successfully rumbles on its way to a full-on bonkers, yet highly enjoyable ending. It's also worth noting here that Forbidden West is very much a sequel to Zero Dawn, meaning newcomers attempting to skip the line and jump in here may feel slightly alienated by the overarching plot, though there's still plenty to enjoy regardless. The story's strengths, however, far outweigh those awkward moments. It's much stronger when focusing on the personal dramas and social and political conflicts of the Forbidden West than when satiating its fetish for rambling holograms. If Horizon Zero Dawn was about Aloy discovering a dangerous new world, Forbidden West is all about a new world discovering just how dangerous Aloy can be. After the events of Zero Dawn, she\u2019s a living legend: worshiped by some, feared by others. The present-day political turmoil between warring tribes paints a tense backdrop with plenty of room for great moments to play out in front of. There are some real standout missions , too: one questline involving a clumsy but loveable inventor trying to fulfill the ambitious legacy of his grandfather is a particular highpoint. It\u2019s a perfect example of how well Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable. Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable. \u201c There are fantastic character moments that are delivered with a deft touch; it's a credit to the writers that I found myself caring so much about the fate of these people so quickly after meeting them. This goes for the actors embodying the characters, too \u2013 performances are brilliant across the board, with no one feeling out of place and even the most incidental seeming characters well observed. That\u2019s no mean feat considering the large cast of fresh faces you'll meet throughout your playthrough. What We Said About Horizon Zero Dawn Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion. - Lucy O'Brien, February 20, 2017 Score: 9.3 Read the full Horizon Zero Dawn review Part of that is due to the fact that Forbidden West is far more concerned about the world as a whole and the people surrounding Aloy than Zero Dawn ever was; from early on it becomes apparent that the whole lesson of the story for Aloy is allowing some of the pressure she places on herself to be carried by others. The supporting cast does a great job of keeping you company, and Varl \u2013 an old friend of Aloy\u2019s from the Nora tribe who is with you from the opening moments \u2013 in particular, provides warm companionship throughout and brings the best out of Aloy. It\u2019s a pleasant change when compared to the often-lonely adventure of Zero Dawn. Actors Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story; the former provides a fearsome presence as rebel leader Regala, even if she is too absent for long stretches to feel like a prominent piece of the story. Meanwhile, Moss brings a touch of class to proceedings as the enigmatic Tilda. It\u2019s never enough to wrestle the limelight away from Ashly Burch as Aloy, though. Naturally, she\u2019s at the core of everything in Forbidden West, and Burch carries that weight with confidence and panache \u2013 displaying power in loud, pivotal moments, but also shining in the story's quieter, more heartfelt pockets. Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story. \u201c On the topic of the loud parts, while Zero Dawn may have been action-packed, its presentation never felt nearly as cinematic as this. Massive moments take place in masterfully choreographed cutscenes with swirling camerawork reminiscent of a Tony Scott chase sequence. It may seem simple, but subtler techniques (such as a wider lens used during conversations) add a filmic quality to dialogue-heavy scenes, allowing characters to use their bodies to move expressively and convey a wider range of emotion. Feelings run high over the course of the lengthy campaign, and while this isn\u2019t anything like the trauma fest of something like The Last of Us Part 2, Forbidden West certainly tugs on the heartstrings. Know Your Enemy A stealthy approach, laying in wait to silently strike from tall grass, is almost always wise at the start of a fight as you'll likely get into the most trouble when you\u2019re outnumbered. Even the less deadly machines, such as darting Skydrifters and pouncing Scrappers, pose a threat in numbers, and left unchecked they\u2019ll relentlessly unleash attack after attack. Rarely has the saying \"attack is the best form of defense\" been truer, and just as in Zero Dawn these enemies\u2019 bodies are loaded with weak points that allow you to affect the way they fight and change it to your liking. Take the new Clawstrider, for example: it\u2019s an extremely aggressive dino menace that can wipe you out with lashes of its devastating tail. Had enough of it? Equip some tear arrows and split your tormentor's tail straight off. Alternatively, coat it with a yellow gloop using the new adhesive ammo to slow it down, which is extremely effective against quick machines like this. That cycle of learning an enemy and their multiple different attacks, reducing the number of options available to them by targeting and destroying their weapons, and then finishing them off with ice, fire, acid, or whatever other damage types they\u2019re weak to never grew tired over dozens of hours. The combat in Zero Dawn was already fantastic, and Forbidden West only stacks more options on top of that \u2013 such as new weapons and ammo types \u2013 and feels better and more flexible than ever as a result. The explosive Spike Thrower is a particularly satisfying new addition to Aloy\u2019s collection of weaponry, lodging projectiles into machines before detonating them to cause big damage. I found this to be a near-essential item against some of Forbidden West\u2019s bigger beasts. Many of these battles are of a scale and a quality that many games would aspire to for their grand finales. Knocking off their heavy weapons and then picking them up to turn their own guns against them adds a dynamic edge that rewards good aim with more firepower. Cleaving the cannon off of a Ravager and unleashing a barrage into the side of Tremortusk \u2013 a gigantic and very angry robot mammoth \u2013 is a pure, unadulterated power trip. The superb score also soundtracks perfectly throughout, dynamically cranking up the noise during high-stakes battles and adding crunchy electronics to the familiar orchestral refrains from Zero Dawn. Battles are of a scale and a quality that many games would aspire to for their grand finales. \u201c The central piece of Aloy\u2019s arsenal remains the bow and arrow though, with many different versions on offer. Mixing and matching to make sure you have all of the different types of elemental damage you need on your weapon wheel is key; the next step is being skilled enough to hit your fast-moving targets. Admittedly, I\u2019m a sucker for archery combat in games, but it really doesn\u2019t get much better than unleashing arrow after arrow into the glowing weak point of a metal menace. It also really brings out the best of the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense, which lets you feel the bowstring tighten on your trigger finger before the recoil cascades through your controller. The machines themselves are exquisitely designed, each bringing their own bag of party tricks to the West. The hippo-like Widemaw that pulls you in with its vacuum mouth before spitting boulders at you is a considerable threat early on, so there\u2019s something extra satisfying about being able to one-shot one with a well-placed projectile between its metal teeth as you grow more powerful. The speed and power with which the machines move is a sight to behold \u2013 not that you\u2019ll have much time to stop and stare as they barrel towards you. But if you allow yourself to slip into slow motion for a moment you\u2019ll be able to see each gear ticking within their gaping jaws before you need to dodge out of the way of death. Who is your favourite modern PlayStation character? Aloy Kratos Ellie Nathan Drake Jin Sakai Miles Morales Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Among the many returning machines is the Thunderjaw, which poses as prominent a threat as it did five years ago due to its vast array of weapons and its sheer size. Zero Dawn cranked up the difficulty near the end of its story, and it's not too different here either. There are a few particularly challenging machine types that you have no option but to take head-on, demanding you have full confidence in your chosen playstyle. Performance Review: PS5 vs PS4 Pro vs PS4 Horizon Forbidden West had a huge weight of expectation laid upon it, yet the results manage to exceed all expectations. Its visuals, even on a base PS4, are cutting edge with a dense and dynamic world, vibrant colors, impeccable performance, and interactions that will leave you aghast at times thanks to the quality achieved. The PS4 Pro is even more impressive, with a higher level of detail, resolution, and overall quality. It already feels and performs like the premium package that all Pro owners will be ecstatic with from beginning to end. Achieving closer quality with the PS5 in performance mode. Of course, the PS5 manages to straddle that line between refined and enhanced perfectly. The 4K 30fps mode secures pixel perfection with a pin sharp and CGI-like delivery that displays the very best Guerrilla Games has to offer (as yet anyway). Meanwhile, the Performance mode enhances the already glorious PS4 Pro version with enhancements to its level of detail, post-processing effect improvements, and twice the performance. That still makes the PS5 the clear choice if you happen to own one of these elusive consoles. That said, the PS4 and PS4 Pro offer up an incredible package all the same, and it\u2019s awe inspiring they pulled off such a technical feat at the end of the generation. Read the full Horizon Forbidden West Performance Review Aloy\u2019s skill trees are extensive and allow you to tailor exactly how you want to play, certainly offering a far more extensive menu to choose from than the original. Out of the six different columns available I put a lot of my points into the Hunter branch in order to maximise my bow skills and increase the effects of the concentration ability which allows you to slow down time. This also unlocked some handy secondary-fire abilities for my bow, such as being able to send a high arching volley of arrows onto a target for increased damage. Valor surges are special abilities unlocked on each skill tree that can be triggered intermittently throughout combat to really turn the tables in a fight \u2013 for example, one of the stealth surges harnesses Stalker machine technology to temporarily grant you a cloaking device, making it easy to ambush unsuspecting enemies. Aloy\u2019s skill trees are extensive and allow you to tailor exactly how you want to play. \u201c Combat encounters vary from fight to fight and eventually demand you display all of the skills at Aloy's disposal as bigger and bigger threats are thrown at you. It\u2019s a great exercise in thinking on your feet and consistently provides excellent moment-to-moment gameplay. One huge contributing factor to this variety is the sheer amount of different enemy types in the Forbidden West. It\u2019s not just in the range of machines on show, but also in the humans determined to stop you. Fighting packs of humans is entirely more dynamic in Forbidden West as you scramble around architecture and vegetation and in and out of stealth. It definitely feels like Aloy has ripped a page out of Ellie's journal here where it comes to how to handle these encounters. There's a fantastic weight to melee combat, which feels like a much more viable and \u2013 crucially \u2013 fun option this time around for Aloy. Swings of the spear crunch into enemies and unlockable combos add extra depth. These come in handy, especially against the energy shield-wielding rebel champions. In general, Aloy feels great to control in combat, light on her feet but heavy-hitting. All until you find yourself caught between a Rockbreaker and a hard place, that is. While not going so far as to adopt the \"climb anything\" approach of more Bokoblin-littered open-world games, there's a greater sense of freedom thanks to your new pulse's ability to scan for handholds on cliffs, and there\u2019s usually a path to reach wherever you\u2019d like to go. Although it\u2019s undoubtedly an improvement on Zero Dawn, I did sometimes feel penned in by a world enveloped by mountains. It's in combat where this is often highlighted, when I\u2019d feel myself scrambling around looking for a handhold to climb a four-foot wall that Aloy really should be able to vault over without even needing one. Unfortunately, this activity often ends in an untidy death at the hands of a trampling machine. It does feel a bit archaic to be restricted to predetermined handhold routes when we're used to much more freeform climbing in 2022. It does feel a bit archaic to be restricted to predetermined climbing routes. \u201c Similarly, while you can now grapple yourself to objects using the Pullcaster, don't think of this as being a game-changer on the level of Halo Infinite's Grappleshot or Just Cause\u2019s grappling hook before it. In Forbidden West it's much more of a puzzle and combat tool used for getting out of sticky situations than it is something that will help you zip around its world. That being said, most of my quibbles with the climbing were quickly forgotten once a liberating new ability (which I won\u2019t spoil) is introduced later on and makes moving around the map a much more exciting proposition. It comes as a great relief too, as it\u2019s a world I wanted to spend a considerable time exploring. Freedom A rapturous harmony of beautiful natural landscapes and fearsome machines, Horizon Forbidden West is one of, if not the most visually impressive game I've ever played \u2013 even when playing on performance mode, which offers a smooth 60fps at the cost of some level of detail \u2013 a tradeoff which I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend due to the fact that it still looks fantastic. From tiny touches like individual blades of scarlet grass to awe-inducing landscapes that sweep the horizon, it\u2019s an astonishingly detailed world. There\u2019s verdant jungle, sweeping desert, snowy peaks, waves crashing like liquid crystal against sand\u2026 the list goes on. Seriously, though, sometimes the only thought that crossed my mind was \"f**k me, have you seen the look of this?!\" Forbidden West takes the time to ease you into its vast world. After a slightly pedestrian and linear tutorial section, it kicks into life and sets you free. It\u2019s clear from early on that Guerrilla has spent a lot more time creating a more interesting open world this time around and nowhere is this clearer than in its settlements, which are universally a vast improvement over Zero Dawn\u2019s comparatively lifeless equivalents. These range from small villages made up of huts and traders to large towns, each with their own quirks. My favourites are those that make homes of old-world architecture \u2013 Plainsong, for example, is a commune repurposing a series of nature-reclaimed satellite dishes. There are many to discover, each beautifully unique, including one particular enrapturing underground location that's home to one of the most visually striking video game levels in recent memory (and I won't dare spoil it). In general, the Forbidden West is littered with physical echoes of past humanity, making for a rich and visually compelling sandbox that almost serves as a museum to the history we\u2019re living in now. It isn't just the environment, but the attention to detail placed in the humans. Each tribe is distinct from one another and the costume design on show is astounding. Aside from being places to stock up on resources and acquire new weapons and armor from merchants, these clusters of civilization are where a lot of side missions will begin. This is probably the biggest area of improvement for Forbidden West when compared to its predecessor, which had very limited and repetitive optional content. These clusters of civilization are probably the biggest area of improvement for Forbidden West. \u201c Side quests are infinitely more engaging and pretty lengthy, too \u2013 they\u2019re not just throwaway requests from nameless wanderers but instead are smartly woven into the main story. Some will involve characters you\u2019ll meet along the main plot asking more personal requests of you, while others will be completely new faces asking you to help out with social issues, such as helping depose a town\u2019s unlikeable leader from his position of power. These side stories only enrich the experience, and while you may not have many active choices to make that influence their outcome, I really did feel like I was changing the world around me as I made my way through it. In that respect, it\u2019s quite easy to be reminded of The Witcher 3 in the way it approaches its secondary missions: you\u2019re not only all but guaranteed a fun time but also very likely to find satisfying stories and unique pieces of gear for your troubles.  For example, one treasure hunt-like quest had me diving into caves and digging through shipwrecks in order to find an ancient piece of technology that I could repurpose into a unique type of tripcaster (the tripwire deploying weapon from the original) that deploys shields instead of the standard traps. A good portion of the side quests and people you meet along the way also help shine some light when compared to the relevant dark themes of the main story. There's a great levity to the writing, which manages to flow seamlessly between talk of world-ending events to witty one-liners. The different quirky characters met and distinctive rewards received from each side quest means that they very rarely feel repetitive. It's a real credit that, in a world so dense with objective markers, very few (if any) feel like rinse-and-repeat jobs. Yes, some missions are just glorified fetch quests (true of virtually every game ever), but when the parts you're fetching are the antlers of a fire-breathing metal antelope, there\u2019s rarely a dull moment. Outside of side quests, there\u2019s a long list of other activities available: rebel camps to clear out, different types of collectibles to find, arenas to test your might in, and of course, scaleable Tallnecks, the giraffe-like recon giants. Cauldrons also return from Zero Dawn, and these challenging dungeons that are carved into mountain sides grant you the ability to override machines \u2019 will and make them fight for you. A particular favourite of mine are the new Relic Ruins , which are fun little puzzle boxes hidden around the world that put all of your mental tools to the test. Some of which take a considerable time to solve, as if bitesize chunks of Tomb Raider have been transplanted into a far-flung future. A particular favourite of mine are the new Relic Ruins. \u201c That Witcher 3 influence even extends to the minigame Machine Strike , a strategy board game that contains all the addictive qualities of Gwent or Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Orlog. It\u2019s impressively deep and there are many, many people in the world to go up against, all with their own boards, pieces, and playstyles. It not only begs to be played for hours on end but also encourages exploration in order to find new machine miniatures to add to your collection. The Best PS5 Games 26 Images The action isn\u2019t just restricted to the many, many objective icons on the map though \u2013 aimless wandering is rewarded with random events taking place across the world, which gives a sense of real discovery. These range from fighting off some rebels who have prepared an ambush by a rocky path to rescuing a family from a herd of aggressive machines, and many more. Occasions like this further build on a feeling of genuine causality to your actions in the world too, as you\u2019ll bump into the same people later at a settlement who will thank Aloy for playing the role of hero. On top of all of this, there's just so much to see and do that I don't want to spoil in any way. Characters, creatures, and locations that I wouldn't want the joy and surprise that I experienced discovering taken away from others. For large swaths of it, the Forbidden West really is a place that needs to be seen to be believed. Where to Buy Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition - PC 0 $59.99 at Humble"

        "Content": "The last OlliOlli game, 2015\u2019s OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood, was a breath of fresh air for the skating genre. Its stylised art, intense level design, and challenging trick system all helped it stand out. Seven years later, OlliOlli World has all those things going for it, too, but it also takes a huge step forward for the series by shifting into 3D, giving its skating a better sense of scale, speed, and dynamism without sacrificing the 2D perspective. At the same time, it builds significantly on Olliwood's technical gameplay by layering grabs, wall rides, and more atop the flip tricks, grinds, and manuals that were its foundation. And on top of all that, it goes out of its way to be more welcoming to players of all stripes, putting forth a host of changes that ensure just about anyone can have a good time without losing the fiercely high skill ceiling the series is known for. OlliOlli World's colourful, cartoony look and character-centric approach is the first thing that had me saying \"ooo\" \u2013 not just because it\u2019s very pretty in its own right, but because it\u2019s also  very reminiscent of one of my favourite cartoon locations, Adventure Time's Kingdom of Ooo. Whether we're talking about your character's skate wizard guide Chiffon, the ice cream-headed denizens of Sunshine Valley, the smiling trees of Cloverbrook, or the many \u201cSkate Godz\u201d that you're tricking across Radlandia to meet, there are too many homages to miss the inspiration. It\u2019s also similar in its effervescent and eccentric personality but thankfully doesn\u2019t feel derivative, striking out on its own with a world populated by endearingly offbeat characters and a story that doesn't take itself seriously, yet is enjoyably earnest at the same time. That board would be ideal for shove(l) its. I'll see myself out. The approach certainly works for me, and the insane level of character customisation available helped me realise my own oddball character to add to the world. The breadth of options here is truly impressive, letting you adjust everything from your physique and clothes to (almost) every component of your skateboard and even some of your animations. The potential for unique creations is on display in a bunch of other ways as well, from seeing your friends on the loading screens to the rival system, which challenges you to beat other players' on each level... and even inserts that player's avatar into the pre-level dialogue to put a face to the name. (That's the character on the right in the screenshot below.) I see your moustache is as needlessly elaborate as mine... Oh, and how's this for an instant win for the character customisation system: You can try on any article of clothing and then revert back to what you were wearing before with the press of a button. No searching for the item to re-equip it again if you realise you made a mistake. Adding the equivalent of CTRL-Z to a character editor is so sensible it's almost painful, and makes testing out new looks a breeze. It's once you start skating, however, that the new presentation really starts to pop. The OlliOlli games have always felt fast and responsive, but World cranks this right up, running at a silky 60fps on PC, with super smooth character animations and a number of dynamic elements. Courses are full of absolutely thrilling sequences, whether that's flying along an undulating networks of rails, holding long, lazy wallrides where the camera pulls way back to show the impossible scale of the trick, or launching at speed out of a grind to fly low over an arching factory rooftop and seamlessly into another grind. Levels are no longer just left to right affairs but sweep back and forth, utilising quarter pipes and complex switchbacks. The terrain can be dense with paths to take and planes to skate on, even looping back around to where you started via \u201cgnarly routes\u201d. And it\u2019s all set to a funky, laidback electronic soundtrack that helps make the skating feel even cooler. Levels are no longer just left to right affairs but sweep back and forth, utilising quarter pipes and complex switchbacks. \u201c One minor additional note on the course design: while all the levels proper are fantastic, some of the side quests \u2013 like popping balloons or rotating in the air \u2013 are rather unexciting, which makes finding the characters that host these challenges less rewarding than it could have been. On the plus side, one side quest does see you try and outrace a bear riding an inflatable tube down a river, so that\u2019s definitely a win. Who is the most influential skater of all time?

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Tricknology The trick mechanics are every bit as impressive as the levels. You're no longer just grinding, flip tricking, and spinning \u2013 with manuals joining them together, but also wall-riding, pulling and tweaking grabs, fitting in late tricks, and even negotiating stairs via firecrackers (so-called because of the rapid-fire bangs as you clack down each step). The latter is a low-key game-changer, as landing in a manual on a set of stairs flies in the face of everything I\u2019ve learnt in skating games over the years, and makes extending combos via stair sets even more delicious than it might otherwise have been. And all these tricks are merely an analogue stick movement or button-press away. In OlliOlli World you can skate the way you want to skate. \u201c Hearing them described, it\u2019s easy to imagine how OlliOlli World's mechanics could feel completely overwhelming. And yet, while it\u2019s absolutely crammed with things to learn, it takes a very relaxed approach to introducing them all, with tutorials peppered steadily throughout the relatively modest campaign. It's not until the last of the five main areas, for instance, that you learn about late tricks and grind switching, and the gradual pace allows you to get used to each new addition as you incorporate them into your flow. Or not. Things like late tricks and the more advanced flip tricks and grinds are very much optional. In OlliOlli World you can skate the way you want to skate. OlliOlliWorld Review Screenshots 8 Images By and large the controls do a fantastic job of putting a lot of options within easy reach, and I almost always felt that errors were my own fault \u2013 either bungling an input, not having enough momentum, or getting the timing on something wrong. That said, I had a few minor issues with wall rides \u2013 especially on moving walls \u2013 that felt a little outside my control, while the grind switching system occasionally had me ollying into a flip trick instead of shifting to a new grind. That could cause some small frustration here and there, but never enough to distract me for long. On that note, OlliOlli World is a far more forgiving game than its predecessors. If you're holding the left analogue stick in preparation for a flip trick, for instance, you can still push with your foot to build speed. There's no penalty for setting yourself too early. And if you're rotating in the air and land side on, you won't crash \u2013 you'll just get less points than if you completed the rotation and landed perfectly. You can even land side on in a manual and continue your combo... well, aside from on stairs, where you do actually have to land facing forwards or backwards. In general though, OlliOlli World isn't interested in punishing your mistakes, it's focused on rewarding your execution. OlliOlli World isn't interested in punishing your mistakes, it's focused on rewarding your execution. \u201c And if you do bail it\u2019s not as painful as it looks, because getting back up and skating again is instantaneous. A tap of a button will reset you back to the last checkpoint, while holding it for a second starts the whole run again. The checkpoint system itself takes a little getting used to though, as these spots aren\u2019t just valuable for restarts but for banking points too, lest you lose them all through an overambitious combo. Once you\u2019re bearing that in mind, there's very little friction in trying sections over and over. Well, aside from the friction of your virtual face repeatedly slamming into a virtual wall. What We Said About OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood There\u2019s essentially no limit to how good you can get at OlliOlli 2. Just when you\u2019ve mastered beating levels in a single combo and timing every single grind and manual perfectly, there are a host of other mechanics to integrate into your skating to bump that high score even further skyward. Why land in a boring old manual when you could revert into it? Why do a standard trick or grind when you could add a rotation or pull off something more complex with a longer \u2013 and riskier - animation? And hey, are you grind switching on every rail you can? It\u2019s an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect. - Cam Shea, March 3, 2015 Score: 9 Read the full OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood Review Flexistentialism Given OlliOlli World is designed to be welcoming to players of all skill levels, just about anyone will be able to see everything Radlandia has to offer. Completing a level, after all, simply means getting to the end, not posting a particular score. This also means that there's a good chance that after you've played through everything you've really only taken your first step down the path towards becoming a true skate god. I'd only scratched the surface of all the challenges when I beat the final level, for instance, and it was truly satisfying going back to the beginning with a fuller understanding of the mechanics and thrashing my previous high scores, as well as beating the score challenges on every level... well, almost every level. Some of the numbers towards the end get pretty insane. Not pictured: the high scores I haven't beaten yet. In fact, to beat those late-game scores the only option is to complete each level in one combo, and even then it's easy to fall short. You may need to take all the alternate (and hardest) paths, incorporate the most difficult tricks and concentrate on timing each grind and manual perfectly to get there. OlliOlli World may not be hard to \u201ccomplete,\u201d but it\u2019s excellent that there are punishingly difficult goals waiting for those who want to attempt them once they do. To beat the late-game score challenges the only option is to complete each level in one combo, and even then it's easy to fall short. \u201c On top of chasing scores, each level also has three bespoke challenges from one of your travelling companions, the somewhat simple-minded magazine editor, Mike, and these incorporate collectables, alternate routes, specific trick spots, and more. Beating the game brings additional unlocks too, including two new modes. These are an online league system that sees skaters around the world vie for high scores on a daily leaderboard, as well as a basic but powerful random level generator that\u2019s perfect for testing your skills in each of the main areas and sharing cool challenges with friends."

I went to work, decided to build my favorite resident a vacation home, and they asked me for a specific aesthetic and some furniture they would love in their house. It took me a few hours, but the finished design combined with their smile made it all worth it. It was rewarding and relaxing \u2013 probably because I was not actually designing someone\u2019s vacation home in real life, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons\u2019 Happy Home Paradise DLC allowed me to live out a life where I spent my time on a tropical paradise helping people build the vacation homes of their dreams. New Horizon\u2019s first (and final) paid DLC lets you visit a resort archipelago to work at Paradise Planning, a company where you help villagers buy their very own vacation homes. It\u2019s a concept that will be very familiar to anyone who has played Happy Home Designer , an Animal Crossing spin-off released on the 3DS in 2015. You\u2019re tasked with recruiting vacationers that are interested in purchasing a vacation home, picking out a plot of land, and then building a house based on specific themes and items the villager wants it to contain. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' Version 2.0 Update and Happy Home Paradise Screenshots 32 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask While the actual building and decorating is relatively straightforward, the simple instructions each villager gives you provide a lot of free reign and creativity, which I found to be overwhelming and has encouraged me to think outside the box when decorating in New Horizons. It\u2019s fun to design something outside of your own home or island, tapping into my creativity in a way that New Horizons previously did not explore. You are given your pick of a handful of islands for where a villager\u2019s vacation home will be built too \u2013 each has different features and sometimes different seasons that make the space stand out from others. Picking the plot of land you want to use on that island also allows you to customize the home\u2019s exterior and interior with decorations. That much freedom could be a little overwhelming, but there is an option to see some relevant items that might help fit the vision of the client\u2019s dream vacation home in case you\u2019re craving a little more direction. Happy Home Paradise also provides you with an option later on where you can build a client\u2019s house with no brief at all, choosing everything from its items to the name of their home. After a bit of playing, you can also unlock roommates, where two clients share a vacation home. Pairing villagers as roommates can be very useful if you have clients that want vacation homes with similar themes. Instead of each having their own home, why not build one and let them cohabitate? This is great as well if you just really want an excuse to finally have those two villagers you pretend are dating to live together. It\u2019s fun to design something outside of your own home or island \u201c However, if you expect to have your entire furniture catalog available to you right away, you are going to be disappointed. Happy Home Paradise makes more furniture available to you as you progress, but it can be a slow burn. That means there\u2019s a good chance most of the decorations and designs you want to use for your client\u2019s homes will not be available at the time of the assignment. Fortunately, there is an option to remodel previous homes you\u2019ve decorated, which encouraged me to revisit and improve my previous projects as I continued to expand my business. The more clients Paradise Planning gains, the more stuff you unlock; outside of furniture, unlockables also include new customization features such as pillars, adding a second floor to a client\u2019s house, plus soundscapes to add a constant ambient sound into a room. My personal favorite was your ability to resize a room, allowing you to set a room as big as 10x10 or as small as 4x4. Outside of recruiting clients who are visiting the archipelago, you also eventually unlock the ability to call in specific villagers using Animal Crossing\u2019s extensive collection of Amiibo cards. You can invite villagers from your own island too, though it requires a bit of bribery by giving them Souvenir Chocolates, which are exclusively sold at the Paradise Planning Office. Speaking of buying stuff, you do get paid for your hard work with the Paradise Planning team. Instead of bells, the traditional currency used in Animal Crossing, Lottie pays you in Poki, which can only be spent on items you buy when visiting the archipelago. For example, you can buy food at the Cafe, clothes at the Apparel Shop, or you can use that Poki to expand your catalog by talking to Wardell, the reserved, yet kind Manatee running the Paradise Planning gift shop. Similar to Nook\u2019s Cranny, five items will be on display with the items switched on a daily basis. While these items are obtainable in the base game, I found the newer items introduced in update 2.0 easier to obtain through Wardell. Even better? After spending a certain amount of Poki at the gift shop, Wardell will allow you to order any items used during your time designing homes for Paradise Planning, and it will ship to your house the following day \u2014 this includes all color variations. Making it a lot easier to catalog furniture in New Horizons. As you complete more houses your Poki salary increases as well, but I found the starting Poki salary to be quite generous, allowing me to buy most of the stuff in Wardell\u2019s gift shop pretty quickly. Once you begin opening up others facilities on the archipelago like the apparel shop, however, the salary increase balances out somewhat with the other facilities that accept the payment. What's the best Animal Crossing game to date? Animal Crossing Animal Crossing: Wild World Animal Crossing: City Folk Animal Crossing: New Leaf Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Animal Crossing: New Horizons Answer See Results If you are really not a fan of Poki, the Paradise Planning office has a currency exchange allowing you to convert your Poki into Bells. Outside of the Souvenir Chocolates, it seems like the items sold on the archipelago are not exclusively available through Poki based on what I\u2019ve seen being sold in Nook\u2019s Cranny. It certainly makes it easier to catalog all the new items introduced as part of the new DLC and the base game\u2019s 2.0 update, which added lots of options whether you buy the Happy Home Paradise expansion or not. The other island facilities you can open up range from a school, a restaurant, and even a hospital, all of which are vacant buildings when you start the DLC. As you build up your clientele for Paradise Planning, Lottie, the head of the business, will tap you into customizing these facilities so that clients can visit. This includes naming each facility and hiring staff to work there. And just like Wardell\u2019s gift shop, every facility accepts Poki as a form of payment. The facilities are by far my favorite thing about happy Home Paradise. You only have but so much space to use on your actual island, and this feels like you suddenly have an entirely new map to call your own. If you enjoy making little skits or photographs on Harv\u2019s Island, you will enjoy the community-like atmosphere that comes when you begin to open up these facilities and see characters using these spaces. It really brings a lot more interactivity and makes the space feel more active than your own island, which maxes out at 10 villagers with most of the NPCs relegated to specific spots. Here's what we thought of Animal Crossing: New Horizons: The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Super Mario each found new life on the Nintendo Switch, and following those games in kind is Animal Crossing: New Horizons: An expanded, polished, next-generation reboot of a classic Nintendo game. Perhaps most importantly, like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is full of surprises. I cannot wait to see what's to come: Seeing cool custom islands from the community, special events, season changes. It took too long to get to the most exciting part of my island renovation (until I cheated), but now that all of New Horizons is spread before me, I have plenty to do, big plans for my island, and so much to look forward to. - Samuel Claiborn, March 16, 2020 Score: 9 Read the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review While it is a similarly slow burn to unlock all of the facilities, yet this method of unlocking feels equally rewarding as you can physically see the growth Paradise Planning and the archipelago experience the more you design vacation homes. You start off at Paradise Planning as a small, unknown business that has a few stragglers coming by to vacation, and it\u2019s fun to work your way up into a place that everyone wants to visit. It\u2019s very much reminiscent of working hard to build my island up to 5-Stars in the base game. Though I wish you had the choice of where you placed facilities or the order in which you unlock them \u2013 I find it much more practical to open up a hospital or a cafe before the school, which is the first facility that you unlock. All the new skills and tricks you learn in the archipelago extend to your main island as well. You can now offer to remodel your villager\u2019s homes, and (with the exception of the room-size adjustment tool) can redecorate or give some of their furniture a nice shine. While it\u2019s disappointing that you can\u2019t use the room-size tool on the main island, the option to even remodel a villager\u2019s home is a nice touch. Especially if you, like me, managed to get your favorite villager early, and instead of getting their actual house, they got a default house that varies based on their personality. In my case, Drago, one of my favorite villagers whose house normally has a lot of cool Imperial-themed decor, instead had the default Lazy villager house with a log-cabin like interior with dirt flooring. Being able to finally redecorate his home without having to kick him out and bringing him back by way of Amiibo saves a lot of headache on my end."

While Halo Infinite's multiplayer is technically still in beta until the single-player campaign comes out on December 8, developer 343 Industries has declared that we\u2019re officially in Season 1, and Infinite comes complete with purchasable cosmetics and a battlepass. In other words, it is for all intents and purposes fully launched. Halo Infinite looks absolutely gorgeous. The environments within each map are so detailed and pretty that I\u2019m now looking forward to the campaign even more. The lighting, settings, and overall look of Infinite bring the futuristic world of Halo to modern-day glory. On PC, it can run at 144Hz easily (and there\u2019s a 120Hz mode on Xbox Series X), and the most severe technical issue I\u2019ve seen has been some server desync and stutters every so often. It wasn\u2019t enough to really mess things up but it was noticeable and made some fights slightly harder than they should have been. I\u2019ve only experienced one crash in my 20 hours of playtime, so my experience has been pretty steady. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Ahead of the beta \u201ctest flights\u201d in September, one of my biggest concerns was how Halo Infinite would be able to court new players in addition to pleasing Halo veterans who have a lot of set-in-stone ideas of how Halo should play. But to my surprise, Infinite does a stand-up job of bringing novices up to speed with its Academy mode, in which you can try out different weapon drills or jump into a Training session against bots with customizable match settings. Training mode allows you to try out different power items (such as active camouflage and the grappling hook) that you may not have been able to get hold of much in PvP matches, and it also helps you learn the maps as you explore at your own pace. You can also join matches against bots if you want to test your skills before facing other players \u2013 and these are some of the most human-like bots I\u2019ve ever seen. While the modes aren\u2019t revolutionary, they are undoubtedly fun and infinitely replayable. \u201c When I did go up against real opponents, the intimate 4v4 Arena playlist\u2019s fast-paced matches gripped me immediately and had me queuing again and again, for hours on end. The only complaint I have about the playlists is not being able to choose which mode you want to play \u2013 you can\u2019t just check a box to pick Slayer or Strongholds, you have to queue for all five game modes: One Flag Capture The Flag, Capture The Flag, Strongholds, Oddball, and Slayer. While they aren\u2019t revolutionary, they are undoubtedly fun and infinitely replayable, and have formed the basis of some of the most enjoyable multiplayer arena shooters of all time. As they say: if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. What's your favorite Halo weapon? Needler Battle Rifle Assault Rifle Rocket Launcher (SPNKr) Magnum Gravity Hammer Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Slayer is the traditional team deathmatch, Strongholds has teams fighting to control three capture points on the map, and in Oddball you\u2019re battling over control of a skull. But among the 4v4 modes, my favorite remains plain-old Capture the Flag, which stays fun and competitive no matter how many times I\u2019ve played it. Coordinating with my team and making mad dashes for the enemy\u2019s flag while also chasing down the jerk who stole ours fuels my spirit, and scoring a capture is incredibly rewarding. Playing either defensively around my flag or offensively in trying to steal the enemy\u2019s feels good, and due to the small team sizes no one is unimportant in a match. What We Thought of Halo Infinite's Single-Player Campaign Halo has meant a lot to me over the past 20 years. From first landing on the ring in Halo 1 to the surprise Arbiter arc in Halo 2 to being heartbroken by Halo 5\u2019s abysmal storytelling, it\u2019s one of the few series in gaming where every new mainline entry really matters to me. After six years, it was fair to wonder: did Halo still belong in the \u201cBest Shooter\u201d conversation? And would I still care about it? I am both relieved and delighted that Halo Infinite emphatically answers both questions with a resounding yes. Turning us loose to explore a massive open ring with almost complete freedom to approach combat with a wide range of iconic guns, vehicles, and toys has absolutely brought Halo\u2019s single-player campaign back into contention as one of the finest out there (to say nothing of the amazing multiplayer suite), and even though it drops the ball a bit with the story and lack of environmental variety, Infinite picks it back up again with style. - Ryan McCaffrey, December 6, 2021 Score: 9 Read the full Halo Infinite Single-Player Campaign Review The only unconventional mode in that list, One Flag CTF, sounded a little odd to me at first because each round has one team defending a flag and the other team has to capture that flag. But it\u2019s actually a lot of fun \u2013 there\u2019s only one map for it, Launch Site, but it has vehicle spawns and easily makes for chaotic and fun gameplay with vehicular Spartan-slaughter as one team attempts to raid the other\u2019s base. All of these game modes are excellent \u2013 and much more so when you\u2019re communicating with your teammates. Making mad dashes for the enemy\u2019s flag while also chasing down the jerk who stole ours fuels my spirit. \u201c I do have a few gripes, of course. For one, barely being able to hear a seven-foot-tall, heavily armored Spartan run up behind you for a one-hit melee kill is incredibly frustrating. It\u2019s an odd misstep (see what I did there?) given that the weapons and effects all sound great. I don\u2019t want heavy footstep sounds like in CS:GO, where you can tell where people are from pretty much all the way across the map, but the number of times I\u2019ve been run up on \u2013 not even crouch stealthed \u2013 and killed is kind of ridiculous. Also, cloaked enemies being silent makes sense since the Active Camo powerup requires you to walk or crouch to stay invisible. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images A big part of the reason Infinite\u2019s matches work so well is that each of the seven maps for arena matches are incredibly well designed to allow for you and your team to fluidly rotate through them, grabbing key weapons and items as they spawn and sweeping out enemies. My favorite map from that playlist has to be Streets, thanks to its flashy neon signs, dynamic lighting, and freshly rained-upon pavement. It\u2019s a perfect example of readability being key when it comes to map design, favoring bold, angular architecture instead of over-detailed environments that come at the cost of instantly spotting enemies and objective markers. It's Strongholds mode that really shows off Infinite\u2019s superior map designs, however, since in this capture-point mode you really need to be able to rotate from point to point with a specific flow to keep an eye on the locations you already control. While the maps in Infinite are smaller than those in most FPS games, the distance between points is just enough that you can easily get from one spot to another. At the same time, you can also get caught out by yourself and eliminated, which encourages you to move as a team. This is where the flow of maps really comes into play. It's Strongholds mode that really shows off Infinite\u2019s superior map designs. \u201c In general, you can run from one side of a map to the other quickly enough that they don\u2019t feel all that large for 4v4 matches, but they\u2019re big enough that you don\u2019t get there too fast or feel like they\u2019re too cramped of a space, either. There are lots of platforms and objects stacked on top of each other that you can use to perfect your rotations, so you aren\u2019t restricted to going down one hallway just to get to a specific area \u2013 we actually have a lot of options in these spaces thanks to the ability to vault up to ledges and the absence of fall damage. I\u2019m impressed with how the map designs take all of this into consideration, especially on this smaller scale.  Even with Big Team Battle, the three maps are evenly balanced for 12v12 matches. BTB showcases expansive arenas with enough space for close-range mayhem, long-range sniper plays, rumbling Scorpion tanks, and flying Banshee fighters. I like how, unlike Call of Duty\u2019s breakneck-paced 12v12 matches, BTB allows for you to catch a few moments of breathing time before you engage in a heated fight. The weapon spawns are spaced out enough to give everyone a chance to run for them and the vehicle spawns are mirrored on each team\u2019s side, making for awesome vehicle runs. Power weapons and items are always a risk to play for since they\u2019re placed in the middle of maps, and that makes balancing feel just right. Big Team Battle has space for close-range mayhem, long-range sniper plays, rumbling Scorpion tanks, and flying Banshee fighters. \u201c All three BTB maps feature multiple terrain types that give their layouts variety in height and sightlines. In Behemoth, there are a lot of platforms that let you get higher positioning at the risk of getting sniped from across the way, since the higher levels are more exposed. However, if you\u2019re lower on the ground you may not spot the enemies above your head. The flow in BTB maps feels great \u2013 it never takes too long to get into a fight but there\u2019s also enough space that I\u2019ve had no trouble with spawn camping at all. After yet another year of Call of Duty\u2019s notoriously bad spawn system, that\u2019s been a breath of fresh air. You can play all of that casually, but Infinite also includes a Ranked playlist, available off the drop, which is a great competitive mode for those who want to surround themselves with equally skilled players. You knock out 10 placement matches before you\u2019re given your initial rank, then you can grind out some matches in that Ranked playlist to move up. The tiers are reasonable (going from Bronze to Onyx with six levels within each tier) but the one thing I\u2019d want more clarification on is how you\u2019re graded on performance to move up or down tiers. Right now that\u2019s a bit mysterious.  In terms of gunplay, the weapons feel decently balanced, with some distinctive quirks to them. The Time to Kill (TTK) is certainly longer than in most other games and took me a bit of time to adjust to, maybe a few matches at most, before I was no longer surprised that a target was still standing after I\u2019d unloaded most of an assault rifle\u2019s magazine into them. It probably takes a couple of shots more than I\u2019d like to down an enemy, and that does make it a little harder to win 1v2s here than in faster games like Apex Legends or Call of Duty. But Halo is very much a game about team play, so if you\u2019re smart you won\u2019t be trying to take on multiple adversaries too often since that usually means you\u2019re overextending by yourself. I have to say, it\u2019s very weird that the MK50 Sidekick pistol is stronger than the MA40 Assault Rifle. While I understand that Halo games have had this balance as the meta going all the way back to the original and the AR is the strongest it\u2019s been in any game in the series, it just seems weird to have a pistol outgun a big, chunky AR. Meanwhile, a few of the weapons you pick up out of dispensers on the walls feel a bit weak in their damage per second (DPS), especially with guns like the VK Commando which sounds and looks like a beefy gun that should knock a target flat but actually takes quite a few extra shots to kill an enemy, even with headshots. It's a little harder to win 1v2s here than in faster games like Apex Legends or CoD. \u201c That said, the weapon variety is pretty generous, allowing you to pick your choice of pistols, burst rifles, and shotguns. The Mangler, a precision-based revolver, is one of my favorite pistols to use since it rewards you for careful shots and can be used at close or long range (once you learn to compensate for the projectile drop). The CQS48 Bulldog is my favorite shotgun (much better than the fancier-sounding Heatwave) because of its tight spread that can take down a target quickly with accurate body shots. Also, the fan-favorite Needler feels especially rewarding when you\u2019re able to stick a full stack of heat-seeking needles into an enemy and watch them explode after a short delay. Overall, the weapons feel satisfying to use and nothing is wildly overpowered \u2013 not including Power Weapons, of course. However, there are a few weapons that I find myself avoiding, like the Plasma Pistol and the Pulse Carbine \u2013 I just don\u2019t like the rate of fire of either of them and they don\u2019t output the amount of DPS needed in a close-range fight. What's the best Halo Infinite multiplayer mode? Slayer Capture the Flag One Flag CTF Oddball Strongholds Big Team Battle Answer See Results The Power Weapons, such as the M41 SPNKR rocket launcher and the Gravity Hammer, are limited to a few shots to keep things from getting out of control when you snag one. However, the Energy Sword definitely seems to have three to four charges too many \u2013 that could be toned down a bit, since right now the only thing keeping it in check is the fact that you have to close in to melee range to score a kill with it. While the weapons feel as great and handle as we\u2019ve come to expect from Halo, one thing that feels disappointingly inconsistent is the melee. Standard Spartan melees are a two-hit kill, which feels fine, but the range and damage rarely seems to work the way I expect. It doesn\u2019t help that Infinite uses soft collision, meaning you can pass through another player, instead of hard collision, where you bounce off of each other. While soft collision keeps people from griefing each other by blocking doorways, a side effect is that the way people can phase through each other means melee strikes don\u2019t feel right. Sometimes you\u2019re able to get a \u201cbacksmack\u201d instant kill while facing your opponent and other times you completely miss by phasing through their body and they get the opportunity to kill you. Also, I\u2019ve seen what appear to be direct melee hits to the face do no damage, even when the enemy is a sneeze\u2019s worth of health away from dying. In Halo, grenades are an art form. \u201c Something you can always count on, though, is the classic Halo grenade plays. Calculating the timing on a grenade throw and counting the bounces before it goes off and kills an enemy is one of the most rewarding experiences in Infinite\u2019s multiplayer. Being able to throw a \u2018nade behind enemy cover and then push them backwards into the explosion is so satisfying, and sticking someone with a plasma grenade is always a hilarious way to earn a kill. In this game, grenades are an art form. Infinite also makes smart use of its gadgetry. The Grappleshot is my favorite, and I use it to reposition myself around enemies in active fights. It\u2019s also great for a quick disengage from close-range fights to heal up before grappling back in to finish the fight. I also really enjoy the fact that you can grapple enemies and catch them off guard, and even throw in an elbow punch to the back of their heads when you get right up to them. I\u2019ve even come to love the Thruster \u2013 it took a while to grow on me, but now I\u2019ve found ways to get creative and dash past enemies, then turn and backslap them during heated fights where they were trying to keep their distance. Microsoft couldn\u2019t have chosen a better moment for Master Chief\u2019s comeback. \u201c The Drop Wall still isn\u2019t my favorite equipment item, but that\u2019s purely based off of my aggressive playstyle \u2013 hunkering down behind a deployable shield just makes me feel like grenade bait. Active Camo is much more my style, since its invisibility allows me to get multiple stealth kills in a row literally before they know what hit them. I also love the Repulsor, which reflects projectiles back at enemies while also pushing them back from you. Using it to throw enemies off the map was probably not what it was intended for, but it\u2019s a ton of fun to mess around with equipment and weapon combos like that. Having that creative freedom is important, and Infinite does a great job of allowing you to have fun while slaying. And all of that comes at just the right time. In fact, Microsoft couldn\u2019t have chosen a better moment for Master Chief\u2019s comeback, with Call of Duty: Vanguard's multiplayer feeling like more of the same and Battlefield 2042 \u2019s main modes leaving much to be desired. Infinite\u2019s long-absent style of team-based multiplayer is the shot in the arm the shooter community needed right now. Microtransaction Reaction Halo Infinite\u2019s store is open for business and the bundles and options for its purely cosmetic wares are varied. The pricing feels fair and evenly set relative to other free-to-play games, with daily Rare bundles costing $5 (500 credits) and weekly Legendary bundles going for $20 (2,000 credits). The Season 1 Battlepass costs 1,000 credits, so about $10, and the Premium Pass Bundle costs 2,800 credits, around $28. Since Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is free to play it makes sense that it\u2019d have a battlepass, but what\u2019s awkward is that the rewards within it are pretty lackluster. Outside of a couple of neat fire effects that can be applied to your character, all you get are things like plain armor coatings and uninspired helmet attachments. Nothing in it has interested me more than what you can earn without paying.  Also, the challenge system doesn't provide much XP, so the free cosmetic options take a long time to unlock. With the inability to choose the game modes you want to play, completing some of these challenges are difficult because you might just get half an hour of Slayer on two rotating maps and be unable to complete a challenge that requires a specific vehicle that spawns on a different map. Daily and weekly challenges should be engaging and make you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing one, but these are just small drops in a very large bucket. It\u2019s too much of a grind to feel worth spending money on the battlepass for some meager customization unlocks as the progression rewards. Even after an update that doles out a flat 50 XP after every match and tweaks to the challenge deck it still feels like a slog, and I don\u2019t feel rewarded for a good performance.  However, I do love that 343 Industries is showing esports teams some love with armored skin sets themed after partnered Halo Championship Series esports organizations, such as Cloud9 and Faze, so you can show support for your favorite teams.

This review replaces our original from 2019, and you can find our new Switch-specific impressions below. Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]   Apex Legends is the only battle royale where I can launch myself up into the sky and dodge bullets in the air while throwing a mini black hole at an enemy squad as my teammate simultaneously rains a hellfire of mortars down upon them. Since its release in 2019, Apex has continued to grow and evolve in exciting ways, adding both more content and fresh new ideas to a genre that too frequently feels derivative. The fast-paced matches never fail to get my heart racing as I jump, slide, and dodge bullets while hip-firing a sniper rifle to win a 1v1 duel and revive my teammates. Mobility, versatility, and teamwork combine for a thrilling and rewarding feeling that I haven\u2019t experienced from any other battle royale.  While the structure here is familiar \u2013 drop into a large map, pick up randomly scattered loot, and fight inside an ever-closing circle to be the last team standing \u2013 it\u2019s the 16 playable characters (called Legends ) themselves that keep Apex from feeling like your run-of-the-mill battle royale shooter. Where traditionally you start a battle royale as a blank slate and have your role defined solely by the gear you luck into, here each has their own set of special abilities and strengths that you can choose from to fit your personal playstyle. I especially love how different Legends can interact and work with each other on a three-person team to get more out of those powers than they could alone. For example, if someone on your team is playing as Caustic or Bangalore and tossing smoke bombs around, choosing Bloodhound for their ability to see through the smoke and highlight nearby enemies will be a natural fit.  Every Playable Legend in Apex Legends 16 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask  And even though some Legends do feel stronger than others in certain situations, I like that who would win in a toe-to-toe shootout isn\u2019t always going to be what determines your victory. The abilities can be used to amplify your own knowledge of where enemies are with Bloodhound or being able to get a height advantage with Horizon. But Apex relies on your personal skill more than the specific moves of your Legend, particularly when compared to a hero shooter like Overwatch where abilities really matter while building a good team composition with restrictive roles to be filled.  Each Legend also has a backstory built off of the same world from developer Respawn\u2019s Titanfall series. Apex takes place 30 years after the events of Titanfall 2 and further expands that already compelling universe through a continuous story that progresses with each major event. While you may not see much of it in the middle of a match, it\u2019s still told well through comics and cinematic shorts that include in-world explanations for how the Apex Games you\u2019re fighting in came to be, how each of the Legends found their way into them, how they are affiliated with each other, and even how they all interact outside of the Games. There\u2019s great creativity and lore being explored here, and considering the Titanfall games never really got their due it\u2019s exciting to see Respawn continue their universe through Apex.  Skill Or Be Skilled  I really appreciate the fact that if you get into a fight with an enemy who has a fully kitted-out weapon and you have a gun with no attachments, you still have a chance to win the encounter based on skill alone. In Ubisoft\u2019s battle royale Hyper Scape , part of the problem with the gunplay was the fact that unless you had a level five weapon, you couldn\u2019t really put up enough of a fight to come out alive or even truly damage your enemy no matter how good your aim was. Fortnite does a better job of rewarding skill over gun rarity, but the level of a gun is still a significant factor. In contrast, all of Apex\u2019s weapons are viable without the best attachments, which makes it really stand out as a game of skill.  Apex has a wide arsenal of extremely satisfying futuristic weapons (some directly taken from Titanfall) that test your aim more than your luck. If you\u2019re into long-range fighting, there\u2019s a varied collection of sniper rifles that run the gamut from lighter burst shots to slow but heavy-hitting slugs, or if you prefer to get up close you can choose from an array of SMGs and shotguns. Every other season a new weapon is added, increasing the assortment of guns to choose from. Gun attachments allow you to further personalize a weapon to your preference in how it handles rather than straightforward damage increases, making how you use that weapon more important than what\u2019s bolted onto it.  Using your weapon well is more important than what's bolted onto it. \u201c  A battle royale should be about testing your skills of survival, and adapting to changes both in and out of a match is a huge part of that. Each season update, which changes things up every few months, comes with weapon adjustments that keep the gunplay everchanging. For example, in Season 6, the SMG R-99 was removed from the ground loot pool and put inside special loot packages that randomly drop during matches, while the previous drop weapon the Devotion was brought back into the ground loot pool. This change was implemented after the Volt, a new energy SMG, was introduced for the season, encouraging previous R-99 main users to use the Volt in its place. In the currently running Season 8, the Mastiff shotgun is the strongest close range weapon that most players are using, with a midseason update giving it a slight fire rate nerf in an attempt to keep the weapon viable but less dominant. While these consistent updates can occasionally be frustrating when it feels like I\u2019ve just gotten the hang of the previous season\u2019s strongest weapon combinations, I do appreciate that the changes and balance tweaks help keep one weapon from being stronger than the rest for too long and generally make each gun a good choice in fights.  Apex\u2019s armor system stands apart from other games too, pushing a fairly simple concept far forward with the introduction of Evo Shields (a super cute name for its evolving shield tiers). With the exception of the Gold shield that heals you for double the amount with smaller heal items, there are four tiers of shields. Only the first three can be found during a match, and after that, you must \u201clevel up\u201d your shield to the next tier by dealing damage to enemies. What I really like about this system is that dealing 100 damage while you have no shield at all will even automatically earn you the lowest tier, so if you don\u2019t find something right away you\u2019re still encouraged to fight through the initial drop.  I love the feeling of earning new armor, encouraging me to push more fights earlier so that I can level it up \u2013 that\u2019s opposed to armor mechanics in other games that can sometimes make taking fights feel like a mistake because even if you win you\u2019ll come out weaker than you were when you started. You can still armor swap through looting better options or taking it off of enemies you\u2019ve killed, but the idea of having to work for the best tier makes fights feel more rewarding throughout. Also, the sound effect that plays when your armor levels up is extremely satisfying.   Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch  While playing on PC is the best place to try creative movement combinations due to the freedom keyboard and mouse controls give, the controls on consoles are still pretty fluid and everything looks good and performs well across the board on Xbox One, PS4, Series X, and PS5. The only exception to that would be the new Nintendo Switch port, which surprisingly performs well enough at 30 frames per second but heavily sacrifices graphics for performance. It\u2019s not completely terrible but everything seems a bit fuzzy, making enemies harder to see beyond a medium to long-range distance, especially when you\u2019re playing on a bigger screen and not handheld mode. This puts Switch players in a heavy disadvantage from other console and PC players which isn\u2019t completely ideal for a competitive game like Apex.   While it\u2019s incredible that Apex can run on the Switch, it\u2019s important to note that the Switch\u2019s version of Apex has a locked field of view at 70, most likely to keep graphics low for performance. Handheld mode makes the graphics more bearable since everything is compressed to the smaller 720p screen but the controls are much more difficult to handle in handheld. The Pro Controller does make things much easier to manage but it starts you off with motion controls turned on, which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for a game like Apex. (You can turn them off manually.) If you\u2019re traveling or want to play away from your desk, say maybe in bed, Apex on the Switch is certainly playable, but I wouldn\u2019t trust it to safeguard my score in ranked play.   In my 800 hours of playtime, Apex has never stopped being fun, no matter if I\u2019m playing competitively or casually. However, you can\u2019t play a game that long without noticing some recurring problems. Annoying audio bugs have been prevalent for quite a few seasons, with missing footstep cues from enemies being the biggest culprit. Usually, that system works beautifully, and I\u2019m able to hear enemies walking across a specific platform above or below me \u2013 but way too often, my squad has been taken by surprise when an enemy team approaches without the usual heads up.  With its Titanfall roots, it makes sense that Apex has the best movement in any battle royale I\u2019ve played. While you can\u2019t wall run, the plethora of other running, sliding, and climbing mechanics it does have can be combined to make moving around the map feel magnificent. The slide move in particular is the smoothest I\u2019ve felt in any game (other than Titanfall itself), and being able to slide down an entire mountainside without losing momentum before jumping at the end to continue running is one of the best feelings in all of Apex. Respawn\u2019s FPS movement systems are still unmatched.  Respawn\u2019s FPS movement systems are still unmatched. \u201c  On top of that, Apex\u2019s revolutionary contextual ping system was the first of its kind at launch and has only gotten more robust since. It\u2019s special because it allows you to quickly communicate with your team in detail without having to use voice chat at all, pointing out items, threats, and pretty much anything else with little more than a single button \u2013 with uncanny accuracy, Apex understands what you mean when you look at something and push the button, then translates that into spoken feedback for your team. And even if you do choose to talk with voice chat, the ping system can still help you better describe where an enemy is, where you\u2019re watching for trouble, or where you\u2019re about to move to. Not only is this a great accessibility feature, but it\u2019s also a clever way to improve teamwork when queuing up alone.  Keeping Things Fresh  There are currently three maps in Apex that make the rounds each season: Kings Canyon, World's Edge, and Olympus. Each map almost encourages a specific playstyle due to the landscape and size difference. Kings Canyon was the first map that Apex launched with and has had numerous location changes over the seasons, but it remains the smallest map out of the three. This makes it the worst offender for getting attacked by a third party when you\u2019re already fighting an enemy team. The small map structure allows for you to hear gunfire from several points of interest (POIs) over and makes rotations very quick since those areas are pretty close to each other. World\u2019s Edge is Apex\u2019s second and biggest map that has the most varied POIs that make it harder to get suprised by a third party as frequently as in Kings Canyon, and has more options for rotations due to the size of the map. Olympus is the latest map to be introduced a few seasons back and is definitely the prettiest map of the three \u2013 it\u2019s also the only map to have a vehicle. Olympus is a gorgeous map with the easiest rotations since there are multiple ways to get from one point to another, especially when driving your very own Trident, the map\u2019s hover car. Each season, two maps are selected to be kept on one hour rotations, which stops any one map from getting stale and keeps queuing up repeatedly from feeling overly repetitive.   Microtransaction Reaction  Apex Legends works based on what has become a fairly standard free-to-play Battle Pass model. With each new season comes a new Battle Pass, exclusive rewards, a new Legend, and new limited-time game modes. The basic Battle Pass costs 950 Apex Coins , which rounds up to about $9.50 and gives you access to many of those cosmetic rewards as you play. Alternatively, the Premium Battle Pass costs 2,800 Apex Coins (around $28) and instantly unlocks three rare character skins and a Legendary weapon skin, as well as the rewards for the first 25 Battle Pass levels for that season. This might sound like a lot of money, but you definitely don\u2019t need to purchase the Battle Pass since it doesn\u2019t do anything to enhance your chances of winning a match. It\u2019s just a little extra something if you feel like getting some additional cosmetics for leveling up during a season.  The pricing can run a bit steep, though, especially with the special Collection Events where there are 24 cosmetic items you can purchase either by buying the event loot boxes or buying the items directly. The cheapest Apex Coin pack is 1,000 Coins for $9.99 and each lootbox is 700 Apex Coins, offering one random event item and two standard (non-event) items in return. During these events, individual skins can range from 1,000 Apex Coins for Epic items to 1,800 Apex Coins for Legendary ones. However, if you buy a Battle Pass and level it up completely before the season ends you will actually earn enough Apex Coins to pay for the next season\u2019s Battle Pass outright.   Alternatively, you can craft the items you want by using Crafting Metals , which are only obtainable through opening loot boxes that you can buy or earn through leveling, or by earning Battle Pass levels. The Crafting Metals required are pretty substantial for Epic and Legendary items, so technically you can still get your desired skins without spending any money, but it\u2019s a bit of a grind. The Legendary skins are the main draw of the Collection Events, and they can usually only be purchased during that time. A few of the past event skins have come back as recolors for a limited time purchase but that\u2019s a pretty rare occurrence, so if you really like a skin in an event you have a small amount of time to consider purchasing it. If you actually end up buying all of the event\u2019s items, you can purchase that event\u2019s Heirloom item , which is a special melee skin that gives Legends a special item to hold when they don\u2019t have a weapon equipped. Again, this doesn\u2019t actually do anything to increase your melee damage or your ability to win, but twirling Wraith\u2019s Heirloom Kunai and stabbing enemies with it is a pretty fun addition to my cosmetics list.  You\u2019ll also have to unlock new Legends, with only six available at the start for free: Pathfinder, Bloodhound, Gibraltar, Bangalore, Lifeline, and Wraith. Unlike cosmetic items, you use an in-game currency called Legend Tokens to unlock Legends for free, which are earned simply by playing matches and leveling up. Alternatively, you can buy the Legends outright by spending 750 Apex Coins ($7.50 USD) per Legend. But it doesn\u2019t take long to earn the in-game Legend Tokens to spend on Legends you\u2019re most interested in, and to that end Apex still plays well as a completely free-to-play game, with a slow trickle of extra items and loot boxes to build up your cosmetic collection without spending a dime.  Do you buy cosmetic items with real money in free-to-play games? Yes, regularly Sometimes, but not often No, never Answer See Results   Alongside its permanent game modes that have teams of two or three, the addition of various limited-time modes added to Apex with different events have also kept it from feeling stagnant or boring. A particular favorite of mine is the recurring seasonal mode called Winter Express in which your squad and two other teams have to hold control of a train that stops at various stations around the World\u2019s Edge map. In it, each Legend has a specific loadout that only that character can use, so you have to choose the best character and gun loadout you feel comfortable with before diving into a chaotic close-quarters skirmish to hold a point. Participating in limited-time events like this is optional for those who just want to play a normal battle royale, but I really like the fact that Respawn is constantly adding and testing new ideas that aren\u2019t quite so focused on the battle royale genre specifically, but rather just the multiplayer aspect around it.  Back in Season 2 Apex introduced a ranked game mode, which is a bit of a unique idea for the genre. I had my doubts about how well it could work since there are so many factors to gauging success in a match beyond the single team that manages to win. For example, randomized loot drops means even the most skilled players can sometimes just get unlucky, which is an exciting part of a given game but makes comparing a ranking across them trickier. Additionally, the relatively open World\u2019s Edge changes team strategy and allows for more rotations than the more frequent, clustered fights on Kings Canyon, while Olympus, operates as a hybrid of the two. Ranked play switches between two maps for each half of a season, so the competitive meta is always changing.  Apex's ranked mode has actually become my favorite way to play. \u201c  However, the ranked mode in Apex overcomes these potential pitfalls, and has even become my favorite mode to play since it pits you against equally skilled players. The rank capping at your skill level works surprisingly well; I thought the ranked system would be strange because you could just keep racking up ranked points if you hold out to reach the top five, slowly but consistently raising your rank even if you weren\u2019t taking many firefights head-on. But the skill-based matchmaking underneath that ranking makes it so you\u2019re faced against people closest to your own skill level, making it feel balanced out so no one is just earning points without having the skill to back it up. For a game in a genre not known for having ranked play, this system works impressively well.  The real problem with ranked play is that Apex\u2019s servers aren\u2019t always up for providing a level playing field. Ping within servers can fluctuate on a dime, and there have been so many times I\u2019ve directly hit an enemy, heard the impact, and seen blood fly out of them\u2026 only to realize that no damage had actually been dealt. I\u2019ve had matches where no one could move without being completely slowed by lag until enough teams had been wiped to ease the server load, and others where it was impossible to switch weapons or heal because the server was so unresponsive. In fact, server desync has progressively gotten worse after major updates, and while there are maintenance updates every so often that smooth things out for a while, it\u2019s not enough to excuse issues like this happening in competitive matches where every move matters. Respawn did announce it was monitoring server issue reports, but more work needs to be done. It doesn\u2019t happen every day, but it\u2019s at least frequent enough that I judge which days I\u2019ll play ranked based on how the servers seem to be operating."

        "Content": "Emerging from the mists to take the survival crafting genre by storm, much like the viking warriors it draws inspiration from, Valheim manages to spin a formula we've all seen plenty of times into something more like uncharted territory \u2013 even in Early Access. Whether I'm sailing the shimmering seas on my sturdy ship or delving deep into dim dungeons in search of treasure, the challenging combat, endearing art style, and moody soundtrack create a delightful and thrilling world to inhabit. It's guilty of becoming a bit grindy, especially later on, but the rewarding exploration and memorable encounters with its various dangers help give all that busywork meaning. Since even before Minecraft, we\u2019ve done this opening routine countless times: by yourself or with up to nine friends, you cut down trees. You kill some animals. You make new tools so you can cut down trees and kill animals better. This makes it tricky, at first, to tease out why Valheim works so well and stands out so much from the dozens of other games like it. It's a lot of little, subtle things\u2026 and a few not so subtle. Valheim PC Gameplay Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The art and world design are definitely near the top of that list. It has a deliberately lo-fi look with pixelated textures and not a lot of polygons to go around. But even so, it's truly a beautiful game. Every creature, sunbeam, and forested hillside is filled with a sort of fairy tale ambience that made me want to get lost in its procedurally-generated regions. And there's a lot to get lost in, from peaceful meadows to spooky, monster-infested woods to snowy mountains. Every time I generated a new map it impressed me with its scale and how it looked like it could\u2019ve been hand-made. Because of the naturalistic, Northern European feel, it comes across as very cohesive and authentic. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world opens up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. The first time Valheim really made me go \"Wow!\" was when, after about 15 hours of preparing, I set sail on my own hand-built ship. Like a proper viking, your main method of long-distance travel will be taking to the seas and riverways. The controls for steering are kind of clunky, and I love them for that very reason. Mastering the art of making tight turns, plotting a course through dangerous rapids, and managing my speed was oh so satisfying, even if it included some trial and error that did a number on my hull. By the time I had mastered the muscle memory to approach the shoreline at full speed and basically drift to a complete stop, parallel to the beach, right where I wanted to be, I felt like a true master of the briny deep. Realistic waves can bounce you up and down, and a sudden storm can even damage your vessel and force you to make for a safe harbor. The ever-changing direction of the wind is a constant consideration that may encourage you to go out of your way and discover something new rather than simply sail in a straight line. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world is opening up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. Sometimes literally, as the deeper waters are full of danger. Dungeons and Dragons Valheim's larger monsters are very well designed in their simplicity. My first time encountering a troll was a memorable and terrifying experience. Some of my most exciting adventures arose simply from trying to figure out how to get from A to B without being smashed into jam. To reach the second boss arena, because of the way my world was generated, I had to sail up an extremely narrow river that ran between two frigid mountain biomes, which caused me to take constant damage from frostbite. Unfortunately, at the very coldest part of the canyon, I discovered the waterway actually became too narrow for my ship. I leapt out, the winter air chipping at my health bar, and frantically whacked away at the voxel rocks of the riverbed trying to make a canal wide enough to let me pass. And then, from the steep canyon walls above, a troll showed up and smashed my boat to flinders. I had to flee in terror, shivering in my soggy boots, return to my camp on foot (which involved spending a danger-filled night in the wilderness since it was so far away), build a new ship, come back, deal with the troll, finish my canal, and get on my way before I froze solid. None of that was scripted, but Valheim's simple but brilliant world generation made it one of the most memorable experiences I've had in any survival game in a long while \u2013 and it's far from the only tale I have like it! This is an ecosystem that consistently generates campfire-worthy stories with a small number of ingredients. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced. If you hadn't told me it was early access, I probably never would have suspected anything. You're out for your morning hunt and spot a troll. What do you do? Run awaaaaaaaaay! Row out in a boat and kill it with a bow while it can't reach. Square up and fight it head on. Lure it into a pit full of campfires and laugh as it burns. Answer See Results Some of those ingredients are better than others, of course. The nearly-ubiquitous Greydwarves of the Black Forest are an unchallenging annoyance, like flies you have to constantly swat away. I would have liked to snap my fingers and see maybe half of them deleted from existence. Unfortunately, I haven't found any magic space rocks for my gauntlet just yet. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced than this. On the other end of that spectrum are the satisfying, hectic, dramatic boss fights that drive Valheim's progression. These really demonstrate the strengths of its combat: There are five in this early access version, out of a planned nine, and I've taken on four of them in the 40-plus hours I've played so far. Not only do they serve as a climactic capstone to each area and tier of technology, they're really enjoyable and rewardingly difficult to defeat. Each is a major step up in challenge from the last, and the third and fourth bosses feel almost absurd to take on solo. Definitely plan to bring some backup and you\u2019ll have a much better time. The randomized dungeons are also a treat, from bone-strewn viking barrows that reminded me of Skyrim to foreboding crypts that bring to mind the undead areas of the original Dark Souls. You'll need a torch to navigate them, and they're full of monsters, treasure, and crafting materials that you can't get in the overworld. Each one is a nice little break from the sometimes tedious tasks you'd be doing above ground. Back to the Grind As with most survival crafting games, Valheim can get a bit grindy \u2013 sometimes extremely grindy, in fact. Harvesting enough ore or metal scraps to get a new set of gear can literally take real-world days. Some later areas require certain consumables, like poison or frost resistance mead, to even survive in them, meaning you have to do a lot of collecting and brewing every time you want to visit. This cuts both ways, because it serves to make them feel more thrilling and dangerous, but also adds a layer of ticking-clock anxiety and a lot of repetitive prep work to exploration as you watch your mead supply dwindle. Not being able to access a new area because I needed to get stronger to beat up a troll is cool. Not being able to access a new area because I'm waiting on my bees to make more honey? Not so much. Work faster, stupid bees! I really like the way other consumables tie into progression, though. While you can skill up in different weapons and abilities, like running and swimming, your health and stamina meters are completely tied to what's in your belly. This means that \"leveling up\" mostly involves finding new ingredients and learning new recipes to ensure you're always as well fed as you can be. Valheim also wants you to eat a balanced diet. You can benefit from up to three types of food at any time, but stacking more than one of the same thing gives you no benefit. This is really one of Valheim's most clever little tricks for making your character feel more alive and connected to the world, and it sets itself apart from the rote, old-fashioned RPG progression routines where experience translates to levels, which translate into more hit points and energy. There's something really satisfying and thematically appropriate about heading out to battle evil with a full stomach, a good night's rest, and a flagon full of invigorating mead to quaff. And it also avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems in other games: being hungry will never actually kill you or prevent you from being able to hunt and gather. You just won't want to go into battle with anything stronger than a skeleton on an empty stomach. Valheim avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems: it can't actually kill you. Building your own viking village can be a decent way to while away the hours while you wait for those bees. While Valheim is voxel-based, it's also much more limited in how much effect you can have on the terrain than something like Minecraft. You can raise and lower the terrain a certain amount, but it's not very precise. The tool for leveling out an area for building was especially unsatisfying to use, as I never seemed to be able to get a nice, even grade no matter how much I fiddled with it. That means all of my buildings were either floating partly above the ground, or the dirt below would clip through the floorboards in some places. Other than that, the structures you can build are cozy and appropriately Norse. They're assembled from a collection of pre-made pieces that limit your stylistic freedom somewhat, but also make sure the things you build really look like they belong in this world. When you move on to bigger projects, you even have to start thinking about support beams and load-bearing walls, which was a welcome little touch of immersion.

The Last Campfire addresses both ends of this spectrum and does so throughout with charm, smarts, and grace. Hello Games\u2019 short-ish adventure hits the mark with cleverly designed puzzles, eye-catching style, and a touching story that left me feeling anything but forlorn. Forlorns, in this world, are lost souls scattered around the colourful land of The Last Campfire; they\u2019ve seemingly abandoned all hope and feel bereft of a purpose. This is in stark contrast to our character, Ember, whose purpose appears more predestined; Ember makes their way through forests, swamps, and caves trying to help as many lost souls as possible, while also questioning what their purpose in the world is. By lighting campfires along the way you\u2019re helping guide the Forlorns on their journey and allowing them to follow in your footsteps. Granted, you never quite know where those footsteps will take them, but by showing the Forlorns that they exist, you allow them to see that there is always light worth finding in the darkness. It was a clear and ultimately highly rewarding journey as I became more and more invested in the world and the creatures calling it home. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Progress is made through solving consistently enjoyable puzzles that almost always hit that sweet spot of not being so simple that they\u2019re boring but being challenging enough to satisfy upon solving, without becoming so complicated that it induces groans. Special items and novel mechanics are introduced throughout which prevent the puzzles from ever becoming too repetitive, and while there maybe isn\u2019t quite the level of variation you\u2019d expect over its six or seven hours, it never fails to offer up something new just before it reaches a point of becoming stale. One of the biggest additions is the fun telekinetic-like ability that comes into play about halfway through the story, and it\u2019s used in many of the subsequent puzzles in clever ways. Manipulating objects from a distance using this provides a welcome breath of fresh air and allows for more ingenious puzzles to be solved in new satisfying ways. It never fails to offer up something new just before it reaches a point of becoming stale. \u201c Hello\u2019s inspirations are clear to see, and not least in the design of these puzzle rooms. It\u2019s hard not to be reminded of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u2019s many shrines -- though there\u2019s no combat at all in The Last Campfire, and this is where different Nintendo influence becomes visible. The minimal approach to gameplay (you can walk, run, pick up, and push and pull objects, but that\u2019s about it) combined with Ember\u2019s inability to jump adds shades of the delightful Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker into the mix. The Last Campfire Screenshots 8 Images With such a limited set of button inputs you\u2019d think it would be difficult to keep things fresh over an extended length of time, but The Last Campfire rarely has trouble there due to its creative use of what it has. It does a fantastic job of constantly mixing things up and keeping these problems thematically relevant, never once taking you out of its gloriously crafted world. The way that meaning is weaved into the design of each puzzle makes The Last Campfire stand out against many similar games and does so smartly at each turn. The core theme of preserving hope and purpose can be found at every turn, often subtly, but sometimes literally baked into the mechanics of a puzzle. This is most obviously exemplified in a series of problems that have you transport an open flame through a level while avoiding airstreams that will cause the fire to extinguish. These start off simple but build in complexity as Ember\u2019s story progresses, providing just one example of how well The Last Campfire takes its central ideas and grows them into something special. Would you like to see more developers make smaller games in between their major projects? Yes No Answer See Results As with any game in this genre there\u2019ll always be puzzles that feel too easy and are over in seconds -- there aren\u2019t many of these but they can be found near the start where a few simple block pushes can form a path for Ember. On the opposite end of the spectrum are more complex problems that, although never too difficult, do offer a significant but satisfying challenge. Naturally, these occur nearer the end of Ember\u2019s journey and smartly layer mechanics you\u2019ve learned previously with new ideas. Some of my favourites of these involved telekinetically moving around a chained set of snake statues with mirrors attached to solve a reflection-based light puzzle. It\u2019s an inviting world to play in, like Thatgamecompany painting from a Media Molecule palette. \u201c This type of puzzle is another example of guiding the light through the darkness; again, Hello puts the core themes of The Last Campfire on display for all to see. This can also be seen in the art design, which beautifully offsets the bleakness with bright and colourful splashes. The most obvious example of this being Ember\u2019s vivid blue clothing and glowing eyes that pop off of the screen during each scene alongside the relaxing, subtle music that soundtracks your journey. Environments range from waterway-filled caverns to pig-infested marshlands, each with their own quirks and pop-up book-ish charm. It\u2019s an inviting world to play in, like Thatgamecompany painting from a Media Molecule palette, evoking both Journey and Tearaway in equal measure. Indeed, the storybook nature of The Last Campfire can\u2019t be ignored. From finding lost book pages written in melancholic ink littered around the world to the larger-than-life creatures (literally, in the case of a quite monstrous pig) you\u2019ll meet on your travels. I particularly enjoyed bumping into and helping out a wistful fisherman by a lake and a talkative robot who gleefully reminded me of Tik-Tok from Return to Oz. Perhaps the most folktale-like aspect to all of it, though, is the way in which the story itself is told. Brilliantly narrated by Rachel August, it\u2019s spoken entirely in third person and calls out actions as you make them in a way that\u2019s hugely reminiscent of Bastion\u2019s storytelling technique (a design choice that has bafflingly still been used sparingly outside of Supergiant). Not only does the narrator tell the story in a fable-like manner - voicing all of the characters like a parent reading a bedtime story - but also offers moments of encouragement to Ember as their journey continues, effectively acting as a passive ally. Taking pages out of Aesop\u2019s Fables and Grimm Brothers tales it touches on real-world problems in fantastical ways. \u201c The story it tells is one that any age can relate to. Taking pages out of Aesop\u2019s Fables and Grimm Brothers tales it touches on real-world problems in fantastical ways, cleverly disguising mature themes in easily digestible ways by having many of the characters suffering from things like anxiety or loss. It still managed to magically put a smile on my face throughout, though, building to an impactful and emotionally packed finale that serves as a fitting end to Ember\u2019s odyssey."

Unexpectedly playing these two games side-by-side this month was a bit jarring, as both tackle the heavy topics of death and those left behind in its wake \u2013 but while the former does so through dark, unrelenting realism, the latter instead offers a colorful, feel-good hug. And though I do love The Last of Us Part 2, Spiritfarer undoubtedly sails alongside it as one of my favorite games of the year.  While genres can be helpful to quickly explain the structure of a game, Spiritfarer has defied all my best attempts to label it. One could say it\u2019s a story-driven base management 2D action-platformer visual novel metroidvania, but I\u2019d rather just say it\u2019s unique . Its closest analogue might be something like Animal Crossing as you sail on, upgrade, and rearrange a boat full of friendly spirits that ask you to complete tasks for them (if, instead of leaving town, your villagers eventually told you they were ready to die and asked you to do it, that is). Regardless of labels, the result is a gorgeously animated adventure that finds plenty of charm and excitement in what could easily be a gloomy subject.  Spiritfarer Gameplay Screenshots  23 Images  You play as Stella (accompanied by her adorable cat Daffodil, who can optionally be controlled by another player in local co-op), who must take over as the new Spiritfarer: a mythological ferrymaster who sails an ocean full of fantastical islands in search of spirits to house and, eventually, bring to their final rest at the Everdoor. That task will take you to beautiful villages full of rice fields, snowy lighthouses, and even bustling spirit cities as you collect resources and upgrade your ship in ways that let you explore more of Spiritfarer\u2019s expansive map. Controlling your boat is as simple as picking a spot on the sea chart, the vast majority of which starts tantalizingly hidden.  Once you\u2019ve set a destination, your ship will automatically chug along to it, leaving you with plenty of time to kill and a boatload of tasks to do. Spirits could ask you to build them a house, collect certain items, or visit specific islands, but you get to decide which of their quest lines to prioritize. You could spend your travel time fishing off the aft and then experimenting with your catches in the kitchen to discover recipes, chatting with your spirit friends to learn more about them, building structures to make new resources available (like an orchard to grow fruit trees), and plenty more. Spiritfarer\u2019s day-night cycle always made it feel like I had more to do than time to do it all in, but there was little penalty to going slow beyond missing my self-imposed deadlines. As a result, it\u2019s a fun challenge to juggle and weave these jobs together efficiently, but never one that felt punishing.  It\u2019s a fun challenge to juggle jobs efficiently, but never one that feels punishing. \u201c  There are also buildable crafting stations that turn raw materials like wood and ore found on islands into usable items through simple but cute button-timing minigames \u2013 like a loom that lets you turn different fibres into thread, and then thread into fabric. The progression of finding one type of material to make a thing needed for an upgrade that lets you find the next tier of material is a bog-standard affair, but I did appreciate how little \u201cgrinding\u201d Spiritfarer asked of me. As long as I was exploring (which I wanted to do anyway) I could generally find what I needed swiftly enough.  In fact, all throughout Spiritfarer, I found myself having to unlearn habits games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have drilled into me. There\u2019s an impulse toward maximum efficiency \u2013 having every station working on a thing at all times; processing all your raw materials as soon as you get them; always making sure you\u2019ve got seeds in your garden and a literal bun in the oven. And while you can play that way, Spiritfarer doesn\u2019t actually demand a fast pace, and doing so turns mundane tasks like melting ore to ingots and watering plants repetitive fast. Eventually, I realized that I could just plant stuff when I needed a certain veggie or make ingots when they were asked for, which turned those tasks back into amusing asides instead of constant chores.  Phantom Pains  The spirits you pick up along the way are all unique characters, each with their own story to uncover, house to build, and even favorite foods to learn \u2013 and while they may start out looking like the generic spirits you see on islands, bringing them onto the ship reveals their true form as some sort of anthropomorphic animal. Whether it\u2019s the lovably obnoxious frog man Atul or the enchantingly posh deer Gwen, they\u2019re all endearing additions to your rapidly growing mobile village.   Each one of them represents a mini story of their own as well, both in unraveling their actual life before death and the literal quest line you\u2019ll follow to make their stay comfortable. Even if some characters are less lovable than others (I\u2019m looking at you, Giovanni), they\u2019re all wonderfully written. Keeping spirits happy through good food and good hugs (the hug animations for each one are just the greatest thing) will also let them pitch in on your journey, sometimes collecting resources or growing plants. Without spoiling them, one of my favorite guests even just gives you cute drawings they made.  But the biggest thing a new spirit will bring is a request for a home of their own. Fulfilling that order asks you to not only find the resources needed to build their abode, but also to find enough space to fit it alongside all the other structures in a complex game of afterlife Tetris. Crucially, few buildings are a simple box shape, usually having odd parts that jut out and slanted roofs that ultimately force your deck into a jumble of ladders and platforms no matter how many space upgrades you buy to make it bigger. It undoubtedly makes it harder to navigate (an issue Spiritfarer has generally, as it\u2019s also annoyingly difficult to do certain simple things like correctly interact with a spirit when they are standing in front of a door), but I loved that this encouraged a wild, patchwork look instead of a boring stack of apartments.  Few buildings are simple boxes, stopping your boat from being a boring stack of apartments. \u201c  The layout of your ship isn\u2019t just for aesthetics, either. Each new passenger also unlocks a corresponding resource-gathering minigame. For example, Gwen\u2019s has you sail into a cloud of spectral jellyfish to catch them as they float by, while Atul turns thunderstorms into an opportunity to literally bottle lightning. There\u2019s no real combat in Spiritfarer, but these exciting encounters fill a similar role and transform the roofs and ledges of your floating town into a platforming jungle gym. Suddenly, layout is incredibly important if you want to efficiently collect jellies, offering real challenge to this otherwise peaceful experience \u2013 and while I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, the combination of sight and sound in a later one of these genuinely made for one of the most magical experiences I\u2019ve had in any game recently.  Styx and Stones  Platforming prowess comes in handy off the boat too, as islands are dotted with hidden chests full of special items, like rare seeds, recipes, or just tons of money. There\u2019s rarely anything too difficult here, but it\u2019s still fun to explore forests and mines alike in search of secrets, all the while talking to the frequently hilarious spirits who live there full-time (some of whom have amusing, if simple, sidequests for you too, like going to other islands to sell rap albums). And while ship upgrades like an ice-breaking hull open up new parts of the sea to explore, unlockable platforming abilities like a double jump or glide will let you access previously unreachable areas on land, giving you a reason to revisit old locations in what is a surprising but not unwelcome metroidvania twist.   The backtracking can get a little tiresome at times, especially as more and more of the map opens up to you, but the way Spiritfarer chains along tasks is impressive. It took me more than two dozen hours to complete, and I always felt like I had a clear goal I was working toward during that time despite rarely having an explicit \u201cmain\u201d objective to lead me. New spirits will come and go from your ship, offering new resources which then unlock new areas that unlock new spirits that unlock new abilities and so on and so forth. This formula does become predictable toward the end, but the characters and locations you see are still so wonderful and diverse that I could have gladly kept going if there were additional spirits to recruit.  But as they come, so do they also go. That\u2019s the cruelest trick Spiritfarer plays: it has you feed and hug and fall in love with these cute, quirky characters, having them help out around the boat and building them lovely custom homes\u2026 and then they have to leave. That part of the job is explicitly explained to you at the start, but the first time I had a spirit ask to go to the Everdoor and leave this world I found myself genuinely in denial. I selfishly delayed it as long as I could, and when I ultimately gave in, taking them there was a shockingly affecting act.  Spiritfarer displays a masterful use of color alongside one of my favorite soundtracks in years. \u201c  Spiritfarer has a lot to say about both life and death, and the way it says it is largely well done. Not all the characters are as impactful as others, but the ones I did connect with really did make me sad to say goodbye. But while it\u2019s undoubtedly somber, Spiritfarer is never a downer. It\u2019s an unrelentingly feel-good game, staying positive (much like the warm hugs Stella so often gives) right to the very end, even when it\u2019s tackling some very heavy stuff.  Part of the reason for that is in its art and music, which are just phenomenal. The way Spiritfarer uses color (especially as the time of day shifts) is spectacular, and all its animations \u2013 from unique hugs to your kitty cat playing with a ball of light \u2013 are impressive as hell. Its music is also some of my favorite in any game from recent memory, up there with the likes of Ori in its orchestral beauty. Even though there were always tasks to complete, I\u2019d frequently find myself just standing at the bow of my boat with the UI turned off, watching the sunset and enjoying the moment as I sailed to a new island."

        "Content": "Formula One is very much defined by its superstar drivers. Hamilton. Schumacher. Senna. These names loom large over entire eras of F1 racing. But while it\u2019s the drivers that get the adulation, the legacies, and the lucrative watch endorsement deals, above all that Formula One is still a team sport. F1 2020 is without doubt the most superb interpretation of that yet, bringing a satisfyingly deep management angle to the most feature-filled Formula One game I can remember. Formula One really is much, much more than just driver versus driver. It\u2019s organisation versus organisation in a chequebook-shattering technological arms race, and F1 2020\u2019s fantastic new My Team mode is a wonderful and addictive representation of this war over precious milliseconds.  Leading by Example My Team stands apart from past F1 career modes by casting players as not just a driver, but as a team owner, too. Where previously we\u2019ve needed to choose and join an existing team as a driver-for-hire, and hop between them as the opportunities arise, F1 2020 allows players to follow in the footsteps of greats like Sir Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren and build their own personal race teams around them \u2013 all while still taking to the track every weekend. While past F1 career modes have allowed us to control car upgrade R&D on behalf of our employers, giving drivers at least some influence on what happens off the circuit, My Team massively eclipses this. You need to build a brand new team from the ground up, effectively becoming the 11th team within the F1 championship. That means choosing team colours, assembling a logo, signing a power unit, securing sponsors, honing a livery and matching race suits, contracting a second driver, and watching your finances as you attempt to grow your organisation into an outfit that can challenge the established powerhouses. My Team adds a huge amount of longevity to F1 2020 \u201c My Team adds a huge amount of longevity to F1 2020. I\u2019ve never hit the 10-year mark in previous F1 games, but I could here. And it\u2019s not just because there are visible things to spend vast sums of your sponsorship bucks on \u2013 like upgrades to various parts of your business, including bigger and better simulators and fancy wind tunnels for your aero boffins. And it\u2019s not just because the finite number of days in the F1 calendar means it\u2019s a constant juggling act to schedule everything from training for your second driver to team building activities for your various R&D departments. It\u2019s because the sense of ownership over the destiny of my race team is something unique to F1 2020. Previous F1 career modes simply haven\u2019t been able to produce the same emotional connection. When my first driver refused to re-sign after our debut season \u2013 after all the time I dedicated to boosting his stats via training \u2013 I was pretty bent out of shape. How dare he? After everything Jack Speedweasel Racing did for him! Seeing him finish last in the first round after leaving my team was surprisingly satisfying. Yes, the livery selection scope is ultimately pretty narrow. Yes, it\u2019s a bit silly that showing any kind of specific attention to one department makes the rest of your staff grumpy, like they\u2019re a bunch of five-year-olds who missed out on a cookie. Yes, some of the recycled cutscenes clash a bit with the fantasy of you being the boss now. But, minor grievances aside, mixing a robust motorsports management experience with the series\u2019 existing brand of excellent on-track action means My Team isn\u2019t just the best thing Codemasters has ever added to its F1 franchise \u2013 it may be the best addition to any F1 game since Psygnosis coaxed Murray Walker into a sound booth back in the late \u201990s.  Time to Split If additional team micromanagement isn\u2019t your bag, or you just bleed Ferrari red and could never imagine racing against them, My Team hasn\u2019t replaced the traditional Career Mode; it still exists as a separate mode. Like last year you can start with a small F2 appetiser, though you can also complete a full season of it this time, if you wish. Failing that, there\u2019s still the regular Championship mode, where you play as a real driver in a fantasy version of the 2020 season. You know, the one that was going to start in Australia instead of Austria. Zandvoort and Hanoi make their debut and, while the latter is a little plain to look at from track level, a pair of long straights and some gently snaking S-sections that you can basically straightline through contribute to a pretty wicked sense of speed. There is no shortage of content in F1 2020. Perhaps best of all, however, is the return of split-screen. And yes, it seems a little silly to celebrate something we had back in 1996, but I\u2019ve had a hoot playing F1 2020\u2019s splitscreen with my kids. You can choose any driver and car you want but we\u2019ve had fun turning the splitscreen into a bit of couch co-op by racing on the same team and striving for 1-2 finishes. I did glance down at one point to find the AI struggling to extract themselves from a monster wreck at Monza my son found himself caught in, but he was howling with laughter at the time, so well played, Codemasters. After all, anything can happen in Formula One, and it usually does. [I]t seems a little silly to celebrate something we had back in 1996, but I\u2019ve had a hoot playing F1 2020\u2019s splitscreen \u201c The inability to mix the excellent, standard simulation handling with the new, more forgiving casual driving model in splitscreen means adept F1 players will probably need to crank it down to casual to share the track with the very young or inexperienced, but it\u2019s a little sacrifice for a lot of fun. The casual driving model provides a helpful friction assist for off-track excursions and an automatic respawn feature for F1 newbies, but F1 2020 caters for the other end of the spectrum too, with improved grip on corner exits thanks to some massaging of the tyre model, and a more realistic ERS deployment mechanic. The main function is now mapped to a single, more authentic \u2018Overtake\u2019 button. There are also neat, nerdy touches like the ability to fiddle with the HUD and fully customise what you want on screen."

        "Content": "There are so many different types of Animal Crossing players, and yet Animal Crossing: New Horizons manages to improve upon the virtual lives of each player type that I can think of. For The Collector, there's a near-bottomless bounty of bugs, fish, and furniture to gather; for The Designer, there are new tools and few limits to what you can craft and customize. But it\u2019s the The Artists, The Decorators, and The Dreamers who should be most excited: There's an entire island to jazz up, expanding the customizable area far beyond the walls of your house, which is all that previous Animal Crossing games allowed them to tinker with. Throw a swimming pool on the beach; add a giant kaiju statue to your garden; even literally move mountains. You can customize so much in New Horizons that it has me just as excited to see what people create as recent, lauded craft-'em-ups like Super Mario Maker 2 or Dreams.  Slow(er) Start In order to deliver a blank slate for you to customize the crap out of, Nintendo made some questionable calls that lead to a very slow start to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yes, Animal Crossing always starts out slow. But New Horizons is even slower: At the outset, two brave villagers and a very industrious raccoon family are the island's only residents. Cut off from any mainland, it's just you, trees, water, rocks, and slow accumulation of buildings and animal villagers over the course of several (real time) days. It's a different vibe than moving to a new town already full of bustling shops and animals going about their lives, and while building a town from scratch offers a lot of customization, it takes too long to get to the good stuff. And by \u201cgood stuff\u201d I mean the basics: The museum, shopping, and even access to parts of the island which require tools like the pole and ladder to reach , all days away from when you first load up New Horizons on your Switch. Every IGN Animal Crossing Game Review 10 Images Like past games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons uses your Nintendo system\u2019s real clock, which means many game goals are locked behind a \"sleep wall.\" Like the paywall found in some mobile games, which requires you to pay real money for resources to progress, in New Horizons you have to wait until the next actual day to see the bridge you built, or the store you upgraded, or the animal you invited to town come to fruition. There's just not enough to do for these first few days while the sleepy island is waking up. You can't scale cliffs or cross rivers until you satisfy requirements that span several real time days. To make it worse, resources deplete and reset daily, so outside of fishing and bug hunting you can't even effectively farm for bells while you wait. Unless, of course, you cheat it by changing that system clock. See below for my thoughts on that...   Should You Time Travel in New Horizons? In Hawaii there's something called \"island time,\" which is sold to tourists as a relaxed way of living that they are encouraged to adapt to by not caring if people are late. (In practice, it means you're going to be stuck in traffic a lot.) If you can adapt to island time in New Horizons, go for it! I, however, was too excited to wait to unlock tools, shops, and all the other goodies (that you get faster in previous games). So I broke my usual rule and time traveled using this trick :   Complete your daily goals and talk to Tom Nook.  Save your game.  Enter the Switch System Settings menu and scroll down to System.  Choose Date and Time and turn Synchronize via Internet to OFF.  Click on Date and Time and set your clock to the following day.  Select Animal Crossing: New Horizons from the menu screen and hit X to close it.  Restart the game and you should be playing on your new day.  It's important to note that New Horizons has built-in penalties for abusing time travel, so Nintendo recognizes time travel is part of Animal Crossing, but lightly discourages it -- so you can treat it like cheat codes for money in The Sims 4, or quicksaving every three seconds in Fallout 4. In the 3DS\u2019 Animal Crossing: New Leaf, I staunchly refused to change the clock and spent the full actual year collecting all the bugs, fish, and seasonal treats available. So resorting to this was a tough decision for me, but one that I'd grudgingly recommend for the first 15 or so in-game days. After that, most of your island layout tools are unlocked and you should be good to go, and the temptation to jump through time should wane.   Custom Fit One way or another, eventually you will have access to the tools to make your island whatever you want it to be, and that's where Animal Crossing: New Horizons really breaks from its predecessors -- and where it shines. The customizable island is a huge advancement. I love the terraforming tools above all else : you can form hills, cliffs, land bridges, waterfalls, lakes, miniature islands, and rivers with ease. You can flatten your entire island and raise a pyramid of waterfalls decorated in skulls, if you want that Bond villain vibe. You can also build bridges and ramps to make your island's far reaches easily accessible, and move any buildings you'd like, at any time. 109 Images Finally, you can place the things you craft and buy anywhere outdoors as well, which represents another huge leap forward in fun customization. You can make a cool beach hangout, or a zen temple on a cliffside, just by dropping things on the ground. The total freedom to create a custom island has me more excited than anything else in New Horizons, and I eagerly await fan community tributes to Zelda, Mario, and other pop culture recreations, along with original designs. I lost myself in island decoration (partially because the act of decorating your island, in turn, unlocks more tools) and began to neglect expanding and decorating my home. But the new home decorator is better than ever as well, with a brilliant new tool to easily place everything without having to handle it, a 360-degree view, and tons of cool, interactive things you can add to your house. Projectors and lamps that you can turn on, turntables and boomboxes to play music that you collect, and even animated wallpaper. The well of things to buy, find, and now, craft, is seemingly bottomless -- and may continue to expand, depending on what Nintendo's unannounced update plans turn out to be.  The Loop A few days in I fell into a nostalgic pattern: The loop. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, my loop is a literal, counter-clockwise run around the island. I spot daily fossil digs, talk to animals, cast a line out to any suspicious fish shadows, hit the shops, talk to villagers, and joyfully juggle the tasks that inevitably pile up. These are chores, and in the field of making chores seem fun, Tom Sawyer has somehow found his match in Tom Nook. In making chores fun, Tom Sawyer has met his match in Tom Nook. \u201c Nook Miles \u2013 which serve as both achievements and a currency \u2013 are an additional system added to New Horizons that became part of my daily routine. These are awarded for, among other things, hitting randomized daily achievements which range from hard (catching a specific type of fish three times) to dull (watering flowers). Miles can be exchanged for inventory upgrades (video gaming's greatest upgrade!), rare island decor, major landscaping tools, or tickets to the \"nearby islands\" (which I\u2019ll discuss below). The miles are, like many other systems, another grind, but checking them did scratch the daily check-in itch I play Animal Crossing for. So yes, I'll water the darn flowers.  Craft-'Em-Up Crafting offers a major change to furniture, clothing, and tool acquisition in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Although you\u2019re now allowed to customize many basic designs, it has a very grindy downside: Because every game has to be Minecraft now, the root of crafting in New Horizons is hitting trees and rocks to see what falls out. This is a slow process, made slower by your tools that you've recently crafted breaking down and thus perpetuating the crafting cycle. It's more busywork than fun, and there are no shortcuts: You whack a stone four times and then you pick up each rock. One. At. A. Time. And while you can fortify your tools to be more durable, I've crafted 15 or so fortified fishing rods at this point, each after the last broke at a really inopportune time. (Pro tip: You can carry your crafting bench with you at all times to make a spare tool in a pinch. No need to leave it at home.) Rather than deal with the crafting hassle, I preferred plopping down bells for weird, Nintendo-designed furniture sets and even weirder clothes in pre-made forms from shops.  What's The Story? Animal Crossing fans probably didn't expect to be reading about a plot in this review, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons not only has one, but it\u2019s appropriately cute and I loved it. Previous games in the series have you moving to a new town and paying off your bills -- that's about it. But in New Horizons, there's an additional motivation to customize your island, recruit new animal residents, and work towards a better \"island eval\" rating; a five-star system that takes outdoor furniture, bridges, ramps, residents, flowers, and much more into account. The details of this motivation constitute a big spoiler, which I'll of course spare you.   How Long Does It Take to \u201cBeat\u201d Animal Crossing: New Horizons? I know what you are going to comment: \u201cAnimal Crossing games don't have endings.\u201d But this one does! In short, I spent about 30 hours \u2013 32 in-game days \u2013 meeting Tom Nook's demands to complete the story and see the credits roll. But beyond that, there are hundreds of hours of things I'm already planning to do with my island, with my friends, and (hopefully) with the free event update DLC planned for later this year.   Critter Country Eventually, your town will be bustling with animal residents -- up to 10 can move in to housing plots you can freely place and move. And the variety of animals available is stunning ! Check out all the ones we know about in the slideshow below to see what I mean. Animal Crossing Amiibo Cards (Series 1-4) 400 Images Each animal has a personality type, and their interactions are always cute: They argue with each other, assemble to sing or do yoga, and sometimes give you minigame challenges (like a funny card guessing game) or random gifts. A cool feature of New Horizons is the ability to recruit new animals via a trip to a nearby randomly-generated island , or from the campground site which occasionally spawns a random animal in town . Even cooler is the ability to force a camper to join your campsite with an amiibo card . If you can track down your favorite animal amiibo cards, you can fill your town with only the A-listers.   My Favorite Villagers    Lucky - A mummy -- or an unlucky, bandaged dog? Well, his name is Ramses in France (a reference to an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh), and he has glowing eyes. Mummy confirmed.  Octavian - A very cranky octopus. You can fish for assorted molluscs in this game and give him one, so that's messed up.  Coco - A... gyroid rabbit? She's made of wood and likes donuts.   Your Favorite Villagers  But who are the fan-favorite animal villagers? Well, we built a fun Animal Crossing Villager Face-Off tool you gotta check out : Each vote will be used to determine a ranked, crowdsourced list of the best Animal Crossing villagers .   Collectathon There are endless lists of things to hunt, buy, horde, and display in New Horizons. Let's start with my favorite: Bugs and fish are back in abundance with a list of 80 each to collect, some unique to various seasons to keep you hunting all year. There are a lot of overlapping creatures from previous games, but it's still fun to find them all and sell the rest for Bells. Even more rewarding is the museum, with gorgeously rendered exhibits that come to life: Schools of fish in custom tanks, swarms of bugs breaking out of their displays, interactive exhibits and adorable photo ops. Even the less-animated fossil wing is greatly improved, with realistic fossil displays and a bizarre evolution room, demonstrating the connections between present-day villagers and ancient beasts. After 32 days of in-game play, and a brief visit to an island in another hemisphere, I had 60 of New Horizons' fish, and 40 bugs, so I still have a ways to go. Check out Animal Crossing: New Horizons complete fish list along with prices here . And there's a big list of bugs in our guide , too. What fruit do you hope to start with? Apple \ud83c\udf4f Peach \ud83c\udf51 Orange \ud83c\udf4a Cherry \ud83c\udf52 Persimmon \ud83c\udf45 Pear \ud83c\udf50 Answer See Results You can take a day trip to a randomly generated \"nearby\" island, which might have different fruit to nab, but \"nearby\" means the islands you visit are in the same season, so you won't be finding rare winter fish while its summer on your island. This is disappointing, because I loved the ability to go to an offshore island in 3DS's New Leaf. It allowed you to cheat the seasons and nab summer beetles (worth a bundle of Bells!) year round. The nearby islands of New Horizons are a dull substitute.  Social Network  Animal Crossing: New Horizons has several different multiplayer modes , including local play on a single switch, where your friends can join with a single Joy Con. It's cool, but chaotic, and aside from showing off your island and taking group photos, there's not much to do but get in the way of each other. You can also visit other islands over a local connection (you have to be really close: About five feet away. If you lose the connection, you lose all the stuff you picked up on another island.) One of my favorite things about 3DS's New Leaf was its StreetPass mode which allowed you to passively view strangers' houses and order furniture you saw there. There's no convenient way to see random islands or order cool stuff from others like that in New Horizons, and that disappointingly cripples discovery. We'll just have to share our amazing homes, fashion choices, and island designs elsewhere.  Event Horizon Although I didn't encounter any major holidays during my review period with Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has announced that those are coming as free DLC updates (which means you cannot time travel to see them early; they don't exist yet). But I did take part in some amusing special events, including a meteor shower where I collected star fragments; a selfie-taking, influencer otter who gave me a fishing challenge; and a chameleon who paid top dollar for bugs. Along with classic visitors like Sahara, Gulliver and Wisp, there's always something going on in town."

        "Content": "If Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order had an opening title crawl like the movies, it might go something like this: It is a dark time for fans of SINGLE-PLAYER Star Wars games. Since EA secured the rights in 2013, only two BATTLEFRONT games have been produced, just one of which offered a short campaign.  Now, RESPAWN, developer of Titanfall 2, has released STAR WARS JEDI: FALLEN ORDER, a large and daring story-driven third-person action game which is actually EXTREMELY GOOD, restoring hope and freedom to the galaxy... Jedi: Fallen Order pushes all the right buttons for a Star Wars action-adventure. It\u2019s a genre remix that samples the combat and exploration of a lightened-up Dark Souls and the action and energy of Uncharted, and that works out to be a great fit for the return of the playable Jedi. The story is a dark one, which is appropriate for a time in the series \u2013 between episodes 3 and 4, when things are at their bleakest for the Jedi and the galaxy as a whole. It\u2019s absolutely drenched in the trauma of the aftermath of Palpatine and Vader\u2019s purge of the Jedi Order five years earlier, with both our young ginger Jedi hero Cal Kestis and his new mentor Cere Junda defined by their survivors\u2019 guilt and remorse over how they escaped Order 66. Cal is respectably acted by Cameron Monaghan, though he never really develops a strong personality that separates him from other generic Jedi characters. He\u2019s a standard-issue good guy through and through, and even at his lowest he\u2019s never remotely tempted by darkness and vengeance \u2013 he just needs a solid pep talk. Cere, on the other hand, far outshines him with an anguished performance from Debra Wilson, especially in the latter half when she relives her darkest moments and confronts the consequences of her actions with appropriate revulsion on her face. Even the main antagonist, the Imperial Inquisitor Jedi hunter known as Second Sister, has unexpected depth \u2013 a pleasant surprise after the two-dimensional villainy of similar characters in the Star Wars: Rebels animated series. Cere outshines Cal with an anguished performance from Debra Wilson. \u201c All of that darkness means there\u2019s less of the upbeat swashbuckling charm of the original trilogy, though a little bit of it shines through. We get a fair amount of comic relief from the four-armed captain Gris of the good ship Mantis and the ever-present, ever-adorable chicken-legged droid, BD-1 (often pronounced \u201cBuddy\u201d). He\u2019s barely bigger than Luke\u2019s binoculars, but he\u2019s extremely useful. Not just through his hacking abilities, which serve as an extension of your own, but because he\u2019ll hop off your back to draw your attention to things you can scan to unlock in the in-game encyclopedia, and the lights on the back of his head are used to indicate your health status without cluttering up the screen too much. The main quest sends our freckle-faced Force-user and crew on what amounts to a Star Wars version of an Indiana Jones adventure (which must make George Lucas proud) that spans across several planets. You\u2019re thrown into not only the sterile metal corridors of Imperial facilities but also the dense jungles of the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, the angry red dust of Dathomir, and other lesser-known worlds with their own look and feel, including ancient alien tombs that you raid. Though they seem small at first, almost every world you visit is revealed to be surprisingly large, with huge sections and shortcuts locked behind barriers you\u2019ll later learn to blast through, jump over, or otherwise overcome. Some of them are dramatically different from area to area, with the exotic Shadowlands region of Kashyyyk standing out in my mind as a surprisingly distinctive location thanks to its creepy carnivorous plants. Other areas include subterranean caverns and ancient temples, all of which stand in stark contrast to traditional Star Wars settings. The vast majority of the puzzles are simple fun \u2013 imagine if Lara Croft could momentarily freeze moving objects and push boulders with her mind \u2013 but one or two got tricky enough to make me scratch my head for a while. There\u2019s almost never too much of it at once, though, so you\u2019re rarely doing the same thing for long. Respawn's attention to detail and obvious love for the source material shows. \u201c Exploration is key to these maps, and both chests full of cosmetic loot and special Force echos (the Jedi equivalent of audio logs) are scattered everywhere. It gives you plenty of reason to veer left when the vague indicator on the map screen suggests you should turn right \u2013 or to make a return trip to a previously visited world \u2013 just to see what you can find after you\u2019ve gained a new ability. On rare occasions, usually after a tough optional fight or moderately tricky puzzle, you\u2019ll even find a chest with something that affects gameplay, such as an extra health canister or one third of a permanent increase to your health or Force capacity. It\u2019s enough reward to keep the urge to turn over every rock going. From the opening scene on a shipbreaking world where the remains of the prequel trilogy era are being literally torn apart for scrap as the Empire builds up its new fleet, the attention to detail and obvious love for the source material shows. Say what you will about EA\u2019s Star Wars games to date, but both Battlefront games look and sound amazing and authentic, and Jedi Fallen Order is up to that same standard. The only thing I\u2019d call out as offensively ugly are the wookiees, due to the fact that graphics technology has yet to really nail a human head\u2019s worth of hair much less an entire walking carpet. All of that detail isn\u2019t free, and while it aims for 60 frames per second in performance mode on Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro, it doesn\u2019t always stay on target. Even a PC with a GTX 2080 struggles with that on ultra settings. And, like many Unreal Engine-powered games, when you\u2019re entering a new area there tends to be a moment of chop as things load into place, though it always cleared up by the time the action started. The screen is mercifully uncluttered of minimaps or quest markers, letting the great environments shine. When you pull up the map screen, the hologram-style projection is minimalist and not all that helpful for precise navigation, but it does give you an idea of where you\u2019ve been, how much is left to do in an area, and the direction you should head in. That\u2019s especially useful when you\u2019re trying to make it back to your ship after completing a story objective, since there is no fast-travel system and it\u2019s easy to get turned around or go in circles. I also genuinely appreciated that it clearly marks where you can\u2019t yet go because you don\u2019t have the right abilities (so don\u2019t waste your time until later in the story) and highlights new places you can go with your recently unlocked abilities. It\u2019s a huge time-saver. The story doesn\u2019t take long at all to throw Cal headlong into the first of many Uncharted-style action sequences where everything\u2019s exploding around him but falling in the exact right position to allow him to jump off of it or use it to climb out of a hole. Jedi: Fallen Order has incorporated just about every trick in the third-person action game playbook: climbing suitably bumpy walls, shimmying along beams, sliding down slopes, swinging from ropes, wall-running, and more, and the thrill ride is at its best when it\u2019s chaining all of these together for a sequence that requires a bit of timing to pull off. (Falling instantly respawns you at the beginning of the sequence with a small bite out of your health bar, so the stakes aren\u2019t that high if you miss a jump a few times.) This only gets better as more Force abilities are introduced and enhanced over the entire campaign, giving it a different flavor than the similar antics of Nathan Drake and Lara Croft.

It\u2019s the only weapon you\u2019ll use (Cal is apparently much more averse to \u201cuncivilized\u201d blasters than Luke or even Obi-Wan) so it\u2019s a good thing using it against enemies looks and sounds completely authentic to the movies, and feels great most of the time. Combat is not straight out of a Dark Souls-style action game, but it definitely shares the emphasis on carefully timing strikes, parries, and dodges while watching the enemy for tells on when attacks will come. Playing on Jedi Master difficulty (the third of four settings), I found that just about every enemy was seriously dangerous if I let my guard down \u2013 the exception being basic Storm Troopers, who are very on-brand in that they\u2019re laughably easy to kill with either a single blow or a timed block to reflect their own blaster bolts back at their very killable faces. Battles with bosses and other foes with lightsabers are brilliantly animated. \u201c Battles with bosses and other foes with lightsabers or lightsaber-like weapons are brilliantly animated with intense effects as colored blades whirl and clash and sparks fly. Every melee enemy has a block bar that must be broken before you can damage them with head-on attacks (rather than dodging and countering or following up a well-timed parry), and that can create some moments that reminded me of Luke furiously bludgeoning Vader before finally chopping off his robot hand in Return of the Jedi. Naturally it\u2019s not just button-mashing until they break: enemies will flash red to indicate an unblockable attack is incoming, and you\u2019ll need to quickly side-step, dodge-roll, or leap to avoid it. Going up against multiple enemies \u2013 even weaker, omnipresent ones \u2013 always feels dangerous, especially with both ranged and melee attackers coming at you at once. Nailing your part of that precise, on-the-fly choreography is always rewarding \u2013 and frequently refreshed by a surprisingly wide selection of enemy types, from dog-sized bugs to enormous space-troll things and the most recognizable Imperial military hardware. Every Video Game Jedi Ever 25 Images Along the way you\u2019ll gather a heaping pile of lightsaber parts (along with skins for BD-1, your ship, and Cal\u2019s outfit) that allow you to individually customize the design of the emitter, the switch, the sheath, the hilt, and the material along with the blade color. There are various ornamental styles that can be mixed and matched to the point where it feels like your own creation, but none of that changes how the laser sword actually functions in combat. That is a constant (with the exception of a few upgrades on the skill tree), which means improving in combat is all on you. (Note that a small handful of these cosmetic items are exclusive to the premium edition of Jedi: Fallen Order \u2013 there are currently no other items or DLC for sale.) The main gripe I have with the lightsaber is that it doesn\u2019t always feel as powerful as it should, and that\u2019s down to game design and technical reasons. For one, while you often cleave small hostile animals and droids clean in half and lop off limbs from larger ones, humanoid enemies (Storm Troopers, Scout Troopers, elite Purge Trooper minibosses, and a few others) were deemed off-limits for dismemberment. That\u2019s usually not a huge deal except for the pretty cool finishing moves that are often automatically triggered, many of which definitely look like they really should have severed a good chunk or two. Cutting through doors is a trick we\u2019ve seen Jedi do in the movies. \u201c The same thing goes for how the lightsaber interacts with the environment: basically it doesn\u2019t, aside from leaving some temporary glowing scars or shattering pottery so fragile that it breaks if you just brush up against it. Being locked out of an area by a simple door seems a little silly when you\u2019re holding the galaxy\u2019s most effective blowtorch in your hand and cutting through doors is a trick we\u2019ve specifically seen Jedi do in the movies. It\u2019s actually fairly rare that you\u2019ll see items around the levels that can be cleaved through, aside from occasional vines or cables blocking your way. This is, of course, a video game, and a lot of that sort of thing is to be expected, but it does unavoidably dilute the Jedi power fantasy. The Force powers Cal gradually unlocks are also surprisingly conservative relative to a lot of Star Wars games. There are only three active abilities: freeze/stun, push, and pull \u2013 no mind tricks, no super speed, no lightning from your fingertips. However, they\u2019re all useful in multiple ways, such as combat and puzzle-solving, so it feels more diverse than that. Plus, I will never get tired of approaching a powerful enemy and simply Force-pushing them off a ledge, avoiding a dangerous fight entirely. And any flying enemies can be quickly dealt with by using Force pull to bring them within range of your lightsaber. Thematically, it\u2019s a conflicting choice to have your Force meter recharged by scoring blows against enemies with your lightsaber \u2013 that kind of aggression isn\u2019t really compatible with the Jedi philosophy as we know it \u2013 but again, video game! I will say that, given that this is the same year Control came out, I longed for a similar telekinetic ability to grab items from around the environment and smash the hell out of enemies with them. Remedy wins that round. The consequences of death in Jedi: Fallen Order are clever. \u201c The consequences of death in Jedi: Fallen Order are clever: Respawn (which cheekily flashes its own studio name on the screen as a prompt every time you\u2019re struck down) has borrowed from Dark Souls and its ilk without leaning quite as hard into punishment. Jedi meditation circles are scattered throughout the maps and using one will save that location as your respawn point and give you the opportunity to spend any skill points you\u2019ve earned. However, it also gives you the option to rest; doing so will fully restore not only your health, Force, but also healing canisters (which can restore your life even mid-fight if you can avoid being interrupted for a couple of seconds). Like the Souls games, though, restoring what needs to be restored also respawns every enemy on the map. Considering how tough some enemies are, that\u2019s not a no-brainer decision. Every IGN Star Wars Game Review 113 Images And when you do die (which if you\u2019re like me is fairly often), you lose whatever XP you\u2019ve gathered toward skill points and have to return to face your killer to reclaim them, creating a brief sense of rivalry and stakes. But here\u2019s where Jedi: Fallen Order gets creative: rather than expecting you to face off against an enemy who already defeated you, potentially with less health than you had the first time, the first blow you land against them fully restores your health and Force meters (along with your lost XP), letting you face them at your best. It\u2019s a great way of getting you over a hump when you need just a little extra leg up to beat a tough enemy, and prevents you from getting stuck as often. The upgrade tree you dump those hard-won skill points into has a few must-have abilities \u2013 the lightsaber throw is unlockable in here, and you\u2019d be crazy not to \u2013 but most are more incremental increases to health and Force capacity or specialized moves that didn\u2019t feel essential. By the time I reached the end I\u2019d unlocked all but a handful of skills, so I never felt the need to specialize in one area for a given playthrough. Most of the best new abilities are unlocked as part of the story, anyway. Without spoiling the ending, Jedi: Fallen Order sticks the landing with its story after around 20 hours, wrapping up its quest with a tough, climactic boss fight and thrilling finale, all without overtly setting up a specific sequel to see how this game\u2019s conflicts will be resolved. Like a Titanic in space, we all know where things are going and where they need to be in about 13 years when A New Hope picks up: Cal was never going to be the one to defeat Darth Vader or destroy the Empire, so it\u2019s good that it knows its place and doesn\u2019t cross any defined lines.

        "Content": "Gears 5 managed to pleasantly surprise me, both in terms of its gameplay and its story. For a series that\u2019s now six total entries deep, that\u2019s impressive. The Coalition pulled it off by taking the time to develop its trio of young heroes beyond the foundations established in Gears of War 4 and having the guts to alter the course of the series in a way I didn\u2019t expect. And while it makes no attempt to fix what isn\u2019t broken with the rock-solid cover-based shooting gameplay, it does augment it in interesting ways and experiments with an open-world structure. Combine all of that with a broad set of multiplayer modes that range from the trusty old stalwarts to bold and spicy new takes on both co-op and competitive gameplay, and what\u2019s presented is a tremendous package that stands as one of the year\u2019s best action games. Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever 10 Images We\u2019ve got in-depth reviews of both the single-player and multiplayer modes. First, here\u2019s what we said about the campaign:  Gears 5 Campaign Review Gears\u2019s third-person action has evolved slowly but steadily from one entry to the next, and in Gears 5 the bulk of what\u2019s new flows through Jack, your handy floating robot companion. He can now snag weapons from the battlefield for you and unlock safes, among other actions, and you\u2019ll earn new abilities for him to use in combat, such as flash-blinding your foes, reviving you and your allies when you\u2019re down, cloaking you, and more. Upgrade components are littered across the world, so you can decide to hyper-specialize in a few areas or have a little bit of every ability. I appreciated the extra tactical layers he offered, and while I did vary my selected Jack ability depending on the situation, I was particularly thankful for the healing power of Stim in the latter part of the campaign, which saved me from dying more than once.  Here\u2019s more on Campaign from my campaign review (or watch the video version above). [And] boy oh boy does Gears\u2019 combat still feel good. This may be the only series where I\u2019m always happy to have the default weapon \u2013 the trusty Lancer \u2013 in my loadout at all times, just in case I get a chance to chainsaw a bad guy in half. The Overkill shotgun returns from Gears of War 4 and packs a potent punch, while classics like the Longshot, Boomshot, and Mulcher are still around to satisfyingly chew your foes into little fleshy chunks. New weapons like the Claw manage to feel unique but fit right in, too; Gears 5 does a tremendous job of balancing the old toys with new ones. Also new is Gears 5\u2019s open structure of its middle two acts. You\u2019ll roam the area on your wind-powered Skiff, free to tackle optional secondary objectives that vary in duration and challenge. Usually your reward is Jack upgrades, so they\u2019re very worth doing. This is a nice change of pace for Gears, just like it was for God of War last year -- who\u2019s to say whether that was by intention or coincidence, but the fact that the first of these sections is set in a frozen tundra only makes it harder to ignore the similarity). Multiple varied boss fights also help Gears 5 feel fresh throughout. Gears 5 Review Screenshots 26 Images   Campaign score: 8.8  Gears 5 Multiplayer Review Arcade is the standout of Gears 5\u2019s iteration of Versus. This new mode is a more casual and chaotic game type that welcomes those who feel they\u2019re always the Gnashed, never the Gnasher, with open arms. Instead of starting everybody with the standard Lancer/Gnasher loadout, you\u2019re given an arsenal based on your character, which can be changed at any point between deaths during the match. Don\u2019t expect to see premium weapons littered on the map with a timer attached to them, either; instead, you buy special weapons and equipment like a Markza MK1 (my weapon of choice) or incendiary grenades with skulls earned by downing and killing enemies. You\u2019re even rewarded with a skull if you die a lot, which can help prevent the feeling of being stuck in a dead-end loop. Your skulls persist through deaths too, giving people who don\u2019t necessarily excel at getting consecutive kills a chance to get a fun piece of equipment. There's also a lobby for co-op versus against bots, so if you\u2019re bringing a new friend into Gears there\u2019s a place for them to learn how to ease into competitive play instead of just tossing them into the meat grinder.  Read more about multiplayer from Miranda Sanchez\u2019s multiplayer review (or watch the video version above). The most exciting of the [Horde] characters, though, is Jack. Your robot buddy from the campaign is a key support character in multiplayer too and is a ton of fun when facing off with your team against wave after wave of fodder. Instead of equipping weapons, Jack has a built-in laser he can use to stun and damage enemies and a repair tool that can heal allies and rebuild fortifications. Better yet, his ultimate ability allows him to assume control of an enemy unit for a limited amount of time \u2013 which is enough to do cool stuff like take control of a Bastion and have it self-destruct in the middle of a bunch of Swarm. At first glance he seems like the character you\u2019d assign to a less experienced player, which is not a bad idea because he can hang back and lend a hand without taking as much direct fire. But in the hands of an experienced player, he can be used to pull off some really awesome strategies, especially since he automatically goes invisible after being left alone for some time. I\u2019d use his increased mobility to flank tough enemies and to collect important weapons for my teammates.  Multiplayer score: 9.0   Microtransaction Reaction  By Mitchell Saltzman In multiplayer, Gears 5\u2019s progression system is extensive, confusing, and feels designed to turn all of us into gears, each grinding away endlessly to try and collect what are, ultimately, a collection of pretty underwhelming rewards. Fortunately the microtransactions barely affect it There\u2019s an in-game store that lets you purchase skins, markers, bloodsprays, emotes, and other cosmetic customization features with a premium currency called Iron. 100 Iron equates to about a buck, and the price of an \u201cEpic\u201d rarity level skin is about 1,000 Iron. So if you\u2019re looking to buy anything significant, you\u2019re looking to drop at least $10. It\u2019s not cheap, but also not essential. The only thing you can buy that affects gameplay even slightly are experience boosts that last one day, seven days, or 30 days, for 250, 600, and 1,200 Iron, respectively. I have no idea why you\u2019d ever want to do that given that in Gears 5\u2019s leveling system, levelling up is largely meaningless. Even the rewards for \u201cReupping,\u201d or reaching the max level and then resetting your level back to 1 in order to do it all again, amounting to little more than a new bloodspray. So you can spend money to do that faster. Everything else in Gears 5 can\u2019t be bought and must be earned by playing through the grind heavy Tour of Duty, which is essentially Gears 5\u2019s version of a Battle Pass (except it\u2019s free). You\u2019re given three Tour Objectives to complete per day that each offer a certain number of stars. The objectives themselves are often nothing to scoff at, like killing 90 Drone Elites, but are still generally obtainable within a few hours of play \u2013 and you\u2019re given the option to swap a hard objective out for a random one, but the more you do this the more Iron it costs.. Progression feels alright, but only for a little while: you only get three challenges per day, so if you wanted to take a day and just plow through them to earn stars, you can\u2019t. Once you collect enough stars to move up a rank you collect that rank\u2019s reward and move on to the next one, in typical battle pass fashion. Unfortunately, the rewards are underwhelming to say the least. For the first eight ranks you get nothing but lame banners, bloodsprays, a salute emote, and then finally when you achieve the rank of Sergeant III, you get your first skin: Fahz in his desert armor from the campaign. It\u2019s not even a new skin! It\u2019s just a recycled skin from the campaign, one that would fit right in if it was available right from the start. This holds true throughout the entirety of rewards in this first Tour of Duty. There are a bunch of banners and bloodsprays (few of which are any better than the ones you start with), basic emotes, recycled campaign skins, a few new executions that you can\u2019t preview, and a grand total of 500 Iron -- not even enough to buy a single skin from the store. So all together, Gears 5\u2019s microtransaction system feels like even more of a mess than what\u2019s come to be expected. The rewards in this first Tour of Duty don\u2019t match up with the absurd amount of time that would be required to earn them, and the items that are only purchasable in the store don\u2019t feel special enough to warrant an extra $10 per pop on a game that already costs $60.

        "Content": "The Gears of War franchise\u2019s multiplayer is special, and Gears 5\u2019s selection of multiplayer modes carries on its tradition of excellence. If you want a break from the intensity of Gnasher shotgun quickdraws in Classic and Ranked Versus, you can swap over to the chaotic weapon party of Arcade. Or a group of friends can jump into a long session of Horde, or Escape if we you\u2019re short on time. They\u2019re all fun and tense, as always, and the impressive new additions fill gaps for certain playstyles and moods.  Regardless of whether you choose to play a PVE or PVP mode, gunplay is precise and pairs beautifully with the chunky running and smooth sliding of the core cover movement. Some weapons, like the Hammerburst and new Talon pistol, feel like they're on the lower end of the impact scale, but most options generally seem well-tuned and balanced in the standard Gears fashion. This means shotguns \u2013 particularly the Gnasher \u2013 will always have a chance for a one-shot kill when you\u2019re up close, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Add that weaponry to excellent cover mechanics (the characters are all tumbling masters) and we've got a solid foundation for a great cover-based shooter. The sound design is particularly good too; the footsteps of COG and Swarm are easily identifiable, and sounds that signal certain map events are great for revealing enemy positions.   Missed our review of Gears 5's campaign? Watch it above or read it here !  While the parade of opening weekend was rained on by the typical range of technical woes, just a few days later nearly everything seems to be in working order and Gears 5\u2019s Versus modes are as enjoyable as they\u2019ve always been \u2013 and more so, in certain cases. Rolling from cover to cover and welcoming foes with a quick one-hit Gnasher kill to the face is great in any Classic or Ranked mode. One small catch is that as much as I enjoy playing Team Deathmatch, it\u2019s a little annoying how often this one mode comes up in the Classic Quickplay rotation. There isn\u2019t a lobby for the other objective-based modes like Dodgeball, Guardian, or Escalation. Since those and others are just lumped together and randomly put up to a vote, it\u2019s been hard for me to put as much time into each of them as I\u2019d have liked. It\u2019d be nice to see them broken out from a TDM lobby like a few are in Ranked.

It\u2019s not just for novices, though: as an experienced Gears player I adore the weapons in Gears 5 but often have a hard time choosing what to hold onto in the campaign, so Arcade is a fun way to get some extra time with some of my favorites. Its change of pace from the standard Versus modes is delightful, too, because it\u2019s more focused on having fun with the loadout of your liking and less about your expertise with Gnashers and wall bouncing. You can still use those, but you don\u2019t have to.  Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever 10 Images  The seven maps for Versus and Horde are designed well, especially for Versus. There\u2019s a great mix of the expected arena-style maps of varying sizes. While a lot of popular shooters come with the worry of spawn camping, Gears has really never had that issue and still doesn\u2019t. These new maps also have great designs that allow for easy flanking of key spots where certain players like to camp.  I\u2019ve long appreciated how Gears of War multiplayer maps typically take place in some environment that further defines Sera, whether it be in a Thrashball stadium in Gears of War 3 or in a diner in Gears of War 4. Gears 5 launched with a few maps like this too. For example, Exhibit is set in a beautiful COG museum that comes complete with a destroyed gift shop and narrow hallways that provide tense spots for Gnasher fights.  The seven maps for Versus and Horde are designed well, with a great mix of arena-style maps of varying sizes. \u201c  The new maps are also mixed up by neat \u201cdynamic map elements,\u201d which add an extra way to obliterate enemies or to pick out which players are more likely to be careless prey. These can be things like a storm on the Icebound map with winds strong enough to interrupt grenade trajectories and decrease visibility. Taking from the campaign, Icebound also has certain ice pathways that can be shot to expose freezing water. Any enemies standing on that once seemingly solid pathway can walk out of the water, but they\u2019ll take damage while they\u2019re in it. One map even has a pair of trains that\u2019ll crush anything in their paths. These hazards are great additions that don\u2019t feel too unfair so long as you\u2019re aware of where they\u2019re at.  Horde has its fair share of added strategy too, and that mostly comes from the shift of having class cards that can be applied to any character to having actual characters with assigned roles and unique abilities aligned with their big personalities. I like how this change helps subtly develop each of the nine characters featured in Horde \u2014 a list that even includes two Halo: Reach characters and Terminator\u2019s Sarah Connor as DLC additions.  See the Halo Spartan multiplayer character in action in the video below:   The most exciting of the characters, though, is Jack. Your robot buddy from the campaign is a key support character in multiplayer too and is a ton of fun when facing off with your team against wave after wave of fodder. Instead of equipping weapons, Jack has a built-in laser he can use to stun and damage enemies and a repair tool that can heal allies and rebuild fortifications. Better yet, his ultimate ability allows him to assume control of an enemy unit for a limited amount of time \u2013 which is enough to do cool stuff like take control of a Bastion and have it self-destruct in the middle of a bunch of Swarm.

I\u2019d use his increased mobility to flank tough enemies and to collect important weapons for my teammates.  Some maps are better built for Versus and don\u2019t quite feel as great for Horde, though. For instance, since Exhibit is only built with two lanes and is a tighter space, it\u2019s rather difficult to choose one good place to defend with your fabricator. This is especially true when a large boss enemy comes pouncing or charging through the map. Even still, they\u2019re a challenge I\u2019m willing to work on solving with my friends.  Some maps are better built for Versus and don\u2019t quite feel as great for Horde. \u201c  My only hope is that with the next Gears, developer The Coalition will consider adding a sort of timed pause for Horde outside of custom games. When you hear a friend has had chili cooking all day and it's finally ready when you\u2019re almost an hour in at wave 25 of Horde, you start wondering when they'll sabotage your team a little just to get a short break.  In lieu of that we get Escape mode, the newest major co-op mode in the Gears franchise and one where time isn\u2019t as much of an issue. Instead of defending yourself through 50 waves like in Horde, you have to get out of a dangerous Swarm hive that\u2019s slowly being filled with venom, and your resources are limited. It\u2019s great to have essentially an inverse of Horde in Gears 5 for when I still want that sort of strategic challenge but don\u2019t want to dedicate hours to one or two runs. Escape also features its own story hinted at through in-game banter (Left 4 Dead style) between its three completely new characters. Each member of the team has a passive and active ability. For instance, Lahni has a passive chance to get extra pickups when executing enemies and she has an active ability to use an electroblade to chain stun enemies and deal a bunch of damage. Composing a strategy between your team of three is crucial for success at the harder difficulties. There\u2019s less ammo, more enemy damage, and other changes to make up to seven total challenges or \u201cmodifiers.\u201d If you don\u2019t have someone producing ammo in some way, you\u2019re going to have a tough time surviving. Figuring out this strategy is easy now since there\u2019s only six characters if you have the three brought in from DLC, but based on The Coalition\u2019s post-release plan, we\u2019ll have more to choose from later.  We break down every Easter Egg we've found in Gears 5 so far in the video below:   Escape is also unique in that it doesn\u2019t reuse the multiplayer maps, but instead has its own map that cycles out with a new one from The Coalition periodically. This means that it can constantly present unique and unpredictable challenges, and there are even leaderboard rewards to go with it. With that randomness comes some rough patches: I did find that some runs were made more difficult because of the kinds of enemies we encountered. Sometimes we didn\u2019t get a certain weapon that would\u2019ve helped with an overwhelming final challenge I knew was coming. For instance, being stuck with a Talon and an Enforcer (two close-range weapons) made any room that required range so much harder than it needed to be. But scrambling to solve those issues by sharing weapons or flanking enemies is part of the challenge of Escape, and restarting a run is always an option. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how this mode changes over time \u2013 and playing user-created maps. I\u2019m still working on creating my own mess of a map."

Things have changed since then with MK9 and MKX bringing the quality of gameplay up to meet the quality of violence. That upward trend continues with Mortal Kombat 11, which is not only the best Mortal Kombat has ever been, it\u2019s also arguably Netherrealm\u2019s best game yet. This is one of the most fully featured fighting games you can buy, with both single- and multiplayer modes that will last both casual and hardcore audiences a long, long time. Mortal Kombat\u2019s defining quality among 2D fighters is that its combat centers around two punch buttons, two kick buttons, and a block button. This is actually more unique than it sounds. While other 2D fighters typically have some combination of light, medium, and/or heavy attacks, with weaker attacks linking into stronger attacks, Mortal Kombat has no such concept. Instead, MK employs a \u201cdial-a-combo\u201d system that requires knowledge of very specific button combinations in order to build a combo. It\u2019s definitely not a super-accessible combat system for newcomers, but fortunately, Mortal Kombat 11 comes with one of the best fighting game tutorials I\u2019ve ever played. It covers everything from basic fundamentals all the way to the most advanced techniques such as frame traps, jailing, and block strings, all while highlighting key concepts and clear instructions on how to implement these techniques.  Mortal Kombat 11 retains all of those unique mechanics that give this series its identity, and of course, the gloriously gratuitous over-the-top and often comedic violence of its notorious Fatality finishing moves. However, surrounding all of that are new fighting systems that feel unlike anything the series has ever seen, and Mortal Kombat 11 is much better for being willing to take these bold steps to keep things fresh. In some ways, less is more, and faster is not always better. \u201c In some ways, less is more, and faster is not always better. To that end, Netherrealm has slowed the action down substantially relative to the last few games, especially compared to the hyper-rushdown-focused Mortal Kombat X . The run button is gone, walk speeds have been reduced across the board, and super-far-reaching and forward-moving combo strings are much rarer. At first, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of how slow Mortal Kombat 11 felt, but the more time I put in, the more I started to appreciate how these seemingly small changes added up to change the flow of a match in a great way. With a greater emphasis placed on careful positioning and whiff punishing and less of a focus on all-out blitzing to impose your 50/50 mixup game, fights feel more tactical and rewarding of smart play. In another dramatic and inspired departure from previous games, Mortal Kombat 11 completely changes up how meter management works by splitting it in two. The defensive meter is used primarily for special wake-up options, environmental interactables, and a combo-breaking move called a breakaway. The offensive meter is used for amplifying your special moves to make them safe on block, increase their damage, open up combo opportunities, and more. The best thing about the split, though, is the fact that it allows Fatal Blows \u2013 a powerful move capable of doing 35% damage on its own \u2013 to exist independently of meter. Fatal Blows are often extremely fast and difficult to react to, but that\u2019s balanced out by the fact that you only get one per match. If even one player has saved it, the closing moments of every close Mortal Kombat 11 fight feel extraordinarily tense \u2013 almost like an Old Western standoff. Every IGN Mortal Kombat Game Review 39 Images  The best new addition to the actual fighting of Mortal Kombat 11, though, are Krushing Blows. These special critical hits activate automatically, but only when certain criteria are met: For example, every character has a Krushing Blow tied to their uppercut that will activate if it hits as a counter, or if it punishes a whiffed high attack. While uppercuts typically cannot be used as combo starters, if it is a Krushing Blow uppercut it will launch the opponent high up into the air and open them up to a substantial follow-up juggle without costing any meter. There\u2019s so much to love about this mechanic, even on just the surface level of it being super satisfying to see an otherwise-normal punch cause a complete bone explosion inside your opponent\u2019s body. On a higher level, though, the addition of Krushing Blows adds yet another level of depth to each character, and rewards a deep mastery of their moveset. It\u2019s also a limited resource, because you can only use each move\u2019s Krushing Blow once per match, so it\u2019s a huge advantage to learn the requirements for each Krushing Blow to maximize their effectiveness. Temporal Kombat  The story's six hours are big, bombastic, and ridiculous in all of the right ways. \u201c Netherrealm fighting games have always been the best at delivering story modes that are essentially the video game equivalent of absurd popcorn movies, and Mortal Kombat 11 is no exception to that rule. It has no new gameplay innovations to offer, but its six hours are big, bombastic, well-acted (other than Ronda\u2019s Rousey\u2019s portrayal of Sonya Blade, which comes across as woefully inexperienced), and ridiculous in all of the right ways. But most importantly, it fleshes out the entire roster and gives each character some time in the spotlight. The story picks up right where MKX left off (check out my handy Mortal Kombat story recap video to catch up before diving in) and quickly introduces a new game-changing character: Kronika, an all-powerful being with control over time who sets the plot down a path of another impending timeline reset, due to Raiden\u2019s upsetting of the balance of good and evil with his decapitation of the Elder God Shinnok.  This all sets up the fun scenario of a merging of past and present, and it allows for some truly great moments where characters from the present are confronted by their past selves. Also, there are some where characters from the past are confronted with the harsh reality of what\u2019s in store in their future. The Johnny Cages steal the show with their witty banter and the overall juxtapositioning of their two wildly different selves, but there\u2019s also a handful of fantastic character-building moments featuring fighters that have traditionally not had a ton of dedicated screen time, Jade especially.  Krypt Raider  Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s character customization feels like the natural and generally stellar evolution and cross-breeding of Mortal Kombat X\u2019s variation system and Injustice 2 \u2019s gear system. The amount of customizable options for each character is utterly staggering, with each character having at least 60 skins, 90 pieces of customizable gear, and a selection of 10 techniques to add on to their core set of abilities. To be fair, most of the skins are simply recolors of the default outfits, but regardless, there are a ton of ways to make your fighter distinct when playing online. The problem is how you get access to them, which is generally not a great time. The amount of customizable options for each character is utterly staggering. \u201c Some of these items can be unlocked by playing through the story mode, but most are obtained through the Towers of Time and the Krypt , two modes that go hand in hand. Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s Krypt, like those in previous Mortal Kombat games, is a sprawling dungeon filled to the brim with treasure chests that require some sort of currency to open. This time around the loot is randomized, which is a big problem because of the fact that there\u2019s just so much undesirable loot. You may open up an expensive chest hoping to find a new Fatality, skin, character intro, or Brutality, and wind up with just a bunch of gear augments for a character you don\u2019t use, junk tower consumables, concept art, or some extra currency. There are some cool puzzle-solving elements and neat Easter eggs to find in the Krypt, but it\u2019s basically an explorable dungeon of lootboxes and occasional jump scares, and that\u2019s a disappointment. Then there\u2019s the Towers of Time, which is a collection of challenge towers unified by some sort of theme, and it\u2019s in this mode that Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s biggest problems lie. Some of the towers employ modifiers that make fights actively un-fun to play. Imagine trying to win a fight against an opponent who starts with twice your health, while also having to deal with a constant torrent of projectiles and assist characters. Or an opponent who will shock you for standing close to them for more than a second or two. It\u2019s a challenge, yes, but one that\u2019s more frustrating than fun. You\u2019re able to use various consumables to give yourself a fighting chance, and they do make otherwise-impossible fights surmountable. But having to resort to miserable tactics, like projectile or consumable spamming, is frustrating, to say the least.  Another issue lies in the character-specific towers, which are the best places to go for unlocking gear specifically for the character you like to play as. For whatever reason, certain challenge towers are blocked off until you perform some arbitrary and repetitive task, like hitting 50 uppercuts, performing 50 Fatalities, or 75 Brutalities(!), which add nothing but a pointless obstacle. Completing the towers themselves already feels like grind, so to have to grind something else on top of that feels ridiculous. To make matters worse, the rewards are randomized, so you might not even get anything that would make the time or effort spent worth it.   Microtransaction Reaction As is the case with just about every other Netherrealm game, Mortal Kombat 11 has a Kombat Pack featuring six DLC characters \u2013 of which only one, Shang Tsung, is currently announced. The Kombat Pack comes with the $100 Premium Edition of Mortal Kombat 11, or can be purchased separately for $40. That\u2019s pricey, for sure, but it\u2019s not outrageous due to the fact that the starting roster of 25 characters is already so deep.  Update: The Premium Store is live, and thankfully it currently consists only of Easy Fatality tokens and a selection of featured items like skins, intros, taunts, and icons that refresh on a timer. However, the cost of these items is absurdly high considering how stingy Mortal Kombat 11 is with rewarding Time Crystals, the premium in-game currency required for these purchases. It's a relief that Skip Fight tokens aren't being sold, though it makes the frustrating design of Towers of Time all the more bewildering.  Fortunately, not all towers are awful. \u201c Fortunately, not all towers are awful. A few of the gimmicks are fun, like having to fight with the screen turning to black every few seconds, and these do a good job of breaking up the monotony of standard AI matches. And, since they refresh with new challenges regularly, you can always jump to a different tower if the one you\u2019re stuck on sucks.  Taking it Online  With progression as deeply unsatisfying as it is, it\u2019s the superb online mode that\u2019s truly going to keep me coming back months from now. To start with the fundamentals, Mortal Kombat 11 has some of the best netcode I\u2019ve ever experienced in a fighting game. Even matches against two-bar connections on wifi have very little, if any, noticeable lag, which is remarkable given how much other games have struggled under these conditions.  All of the expected options are here: you can play ranked matches, casual matches, or King of the Hill, but you can also play weird AI matches where you pit a team of your own customized characters against someone else\u2019s and watch them fight it out for rewards. You can enhance your fighters in this mode with special augments and even set their AI behavior, but there\u2019s not much else to it outside of a way to keep Mortal Kombat 11 running and still earn some rewards.  The way character customization is handled in ranked play is interesting. You\u2019re able to set your cosmetics however you wish, but every character has two preset competitive variations that you must choose from. What\u2019s weird is that these variations do not exist as premade variations anywhere but in competitive play, so it\u2019s strange that you must actually go and create them yourself if you wish to practice with them. It\u2019s also a bit of a bummer that you can\u2019t customize your movesets in ranked play, especially since some of the best and most effective moves, like Scorpion\u2019s Misery Blade, for instance, aren\u2019t usable at all in ranked. Fortunately, the casual playlist allows you to use whatever you want, and unlike Injustice 2, there are no stat upgrades tied to gear, so everyone\u2019s on an even playing field."

        "Content": "The first Devil May Cry sparked my love of action games in general, but as the series has gone on it\u2019s kept that place in my heart because they aren\u2019t just about killing every enemy in a room. They\u2019re about how you killed every enemy in a room, expressing yourself in an almost artistic and highly technical dance of swords, guns, and lots of jump cancels. Devil May Cry 5 is the new pinnacle of this particular subset of the genre, thanks to a perfectly paced campaign that mixes in three completely different playstyles, each of which containing enough depth to carry a game of their own; a fun and satisfying story; and quite simply one of the best combat systems you\u2019ll find in video games.  Devil May Cry 5\u2019s story is somewhat unconventional in that it starts with events that would normally feel like the climax: you\u2019re thrown right into a fight you\u2019re meant to lose. After Dante stays behind to let Nero and a new character named V escape from a super-powered demon king named Urizen, the story jumps around a time period of a couple of months, rotating through perspectives as it tells the present-day story of Dante, Nero, and V, while also explaining the circumstances that led to Urizen\u2019s rise to power and V\u2019s quest to take him down.  There\u2019s a great air of mystery to the unknown nature of both Urizen and V. Like Nero, I was never sure if I could trust V and found myself formulating theory after theory about his identity and motives with every new morsel of information that was fed to me. By the end of its 10 to 12 hours I still had some questions left over, but overall the plot kept me hooked all the way through with satisfying revelations, a few answers that fill in some long-standing series plot holes, and of course, the off-the-wall action that only Devil May Cry can deliver. Devil May Cry 5\u2019s combat is absolutely sublime. On the surface, it\u2019s a very simple system: There\u2019s one button for melee attacks, one for ranged attacks, and one for your Devil Breaker, style technique, or cane attack, depending on which character you\u2019re using. If that\u2019s as deep as you want to go, you can absolutely get through the campaign on normal difficulty just fine with nothing more. There\u2019s even an \u201cauto-assist\u201d mode that automatically performs cool and flashy combos by just mashing the attack button, letting even casual players feel what it\u2019s like to play at a higher technical level. The beauty of DMC 5\u2019s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and variety. \u201c But the beauty of Devil May Cry 5\u2019s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and variety its three sets of tools offer. If you\u2019re playing as Nero, those tools are your revvable Red Queen sword, chargeable Blue Rose handgun, a grapple that can pull enemies towards you, and an ever-growing arsenal of Devil Breakers, which are disposable mechanical arms that each provide Nero with new abilities and utility. My favorite, Punchline, shoots out an arm that homes in on an enemy and keeps them in place with quick rocket punches. But the real fun starts when you hold down the Devil Breaker button while Punchline is out, allowing you to jump on top of it and ride it like a hoverboard, knocking enemies up into the air with flips, 360s, and other sick stunts. Dante\u2019s gameplay is by far the most familiar because he plays almost exactly the same as his Devil May Cry 4 counterpart, which is to say that he\u2019s essentially a Swiss army knife. He can swap between four distinct styles (Trickster, Royal Guard, Gunslinger, and Swordmaster) four melee weapons , and four ranged weapons, all on the fly. His arsenal is a fantastic mix of old and new, with the old weapons kept fresh thanks to a number of new tweaks and techniques, and the new weapons adding new layers to Dante\u2019s combat that he\u2019s never had before. He even has a motorcycle that he can crash into enemies with and then transform into two slow but heavy-hitting buzzsaw swords and back again, all in the space of a single combo. V plays completely unlike any character in any Devil May Cry game. \u201c And then finally there\u2019s V, who plays completely unlike any character in any Devil May Cry game due to the fact that he barely does any of the fighting himself. Instead, he summons three familiars to do battle for him: There\u2019s Shadow, a black cat that can morph into various blades and creatures; Griffon, a bird that can fire a variety of electrical blasts from a distance; and Nightmare, a gargantuan beast that can only be summoned when V builds up his Devil Trigger meter. Nightmare fights completely autonomously, and it can be very extremely satisfying to watch him emerge through a wall or rain down from the sky and just wreck a whole crowd of enemies. Your familiars can\u2019t actually kill anything, though, so V has to teleport around and deliver the finishing blow with his cane once an enemy has been primed for the kill. That leads to some very cool kill sequences where V just blinks from enemy to enemy, wiping them out one by one while your familiars carry on the fight in the background. Using V effectively has a pretty steep learning curve, even by Devil May Cry standards, due to the fact that you don\u2019t actually have any directional control over Shadow or Griffon. Getting them to attack a specific enemy can be a challenge, and trying to keep track of where they are in relation to the enemy can also be tricky. However, you can use some of your Devil Trigger meter to have them autonomously attack, allowing you to focus on dodging. Or, if you feel you have a few moments of safety you could read a book and regain some of that meter... Or just play some violin to taunt them. Even so, V\u2019s missions are the weakest of the trio, mainly because his movement feels so much more limited compared to Dante and Nero. But that\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re bad by any stretch. Once you get a couple of upgrades for Shadow and Griffon under your belt and get used to the flow of combat, V\u2019s unique gameplay becomes quite fun, and it\u2019s used sparingly enough to never outstay its welcome.   Microtransaction Reaction  There are eight Devil Breakers in the base game for Nero to equip, but there are also four more that are sold separately as DLC (and included in the $70 Deluxe Edition). The four DLC breakers include The Pasta Breaker, an arm with a fork attached to the end that shoots out to continuously attack an enemy, push them away, and then returns them to you; The Mega Buster, a gun arm that\u2019s a direct nod to the Mega Buster from Mega Man; The Gerbera GP01, a modified version of the Gerbera Devil Breaker; and the Sweet Surrender, which can heal Nero moderately over time, or be charged for a quick burst of health. Another Deluxe Edition piece of DLC is the Cavaliere R, which is pretty much the exact same as the Cavaliere that Dante obtains naturally, with the exception of a slick red paint job, and one awesome technique that causes Dante to fly towards an enemy at high speed. None are essential but they\u2019re all pretty fun to use, with the exception of Sweet Surrender, which felt like a waste of an inventory slot since its only purpose is to heal. I could see getting the Pasta Breaker and Gerbera for $1 each, but $3 for each of the others doesn\u2019t seem worth it for what they add.  It should also be duly noted that you can purchase Red Orbs, Devil May Cry 5\u2019s main source of currency, with real money. That\u2019s always a bad look. That being said, the Red Orb cost of just about every upgrade and technique feels appropriately priced (aside from one special technique for each character that\u2019s clearly there for high-level players to strive for), and I never felt any kind of need or desire to drop real cash on Red Orbs, nor did I ever feel like I had to farm them in-game. It should be said that Devil May Cry 5 looks and sounds stellar. Style and personality oozes out every animation, whether it\u2019s Nero\u2019s wild engine-powered sword attacks that send him flying across the level, Dante\u2019s smug teasing of the various bosses, or V\u2019s subtle mannerisms that just add to his mystique. Level design is more linear and much less puzzle-heavy relative to previous Devil May Cry games, which I appreciated, as it kept the brisk pace up and put more of an emphasis on skill-based combat challenges. Like, for example, there are a few where you must kill a pack of enemies before their weight causes the platform to fall, which would seal off a hidden room with goodies. That being said, the environments are not as varied as they have been in the past, and you\u2019ll be traveling through a lot of similarly demon-torn cityscapes and hellish underground chasms. The 10 Best Devil May Cry Weapons, Ranked 11 Images Though the Devil May Cry games have a bit of a reputation for being difficult, on its default settings DMC5 isn\u2019t terribly hard. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite forgiving if all you want to do is survive the ordeal. When you die, you can use a Gold Orb to revive on the spot with all your health and Devil Trigger meters refilled, and those aren\u2019t hard to come by: You can often find them off the beaten path in a level, you earn one per day as a daily login bonus, or you can have your performance rated positively in the weird cameo system, which records a ghost of your character when you play through certain levels and adds that ghost into another player\u2019s game. If you run out of Gold Orbs (I was swimming in them by the end) you can also spend the much more common Red Orbs to revive with and buy back health. It\u2019s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the enemies in the room. \u201c Staying alive isn\u2019t really the challenge, though. As I said at the start, what I love about Devil May Cry as a series is that it\u2019s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the enemies in the room. Trying to get SSS ranks is a real worthwhile challenge that made up for the lack of base difficulty. To that end, I sprang at every opportunity to buy new techniques, which is rewarding because Devil May Cry 5 is paced in such a way that you are constantly getting new toys at just about every turn \u2013 whether it be a new form, weapon, or Devil Breaker \u2013 and they all come with their own set of new upgrades. By the end of the story all three of my characters felt like all-powerful gods, with even more upgrades still left to be purchased for my next run in the unlockable Son of Sparda mode , which is essentially New Game+ and where the true challenge of Devil May Cry 5 starts to rear its head. Finally, a great combat system isn\u2019t worth much if the enemies aren\u2019t fun to fight, but fortunately Devil May Cry 5\u2019s meet the high standards set by previous games in the series. There\u2019s a great mix of common fodder enemies that allow you to do basically whatever you want to them to build your combos, tanky enemies that require specific tactics to bypass their defenses, and powerful support baddies that can deal big damage from afar and can be very threatening if not brought down quickly. The same goes for bosses, with a few of the later fights being among the strongest the series has seen. There\u2019s a solid variety of them too, with several towering and powerful beasts, others who are agile and elusive, but the best are just straight up one-on-one duels with high-speed action that require quick reflexes and a careful balance of offense and defense."

With impressive cutscenes, including the gut-punch death of Cayde-6, it adds drama and a darkness that keeps me motivated. The raid offers intricate challenges and larger-than-life bosses to destroy for any team brave enough to face them for a chance at great rewards. Stunning new locations, like the Dreaming City, keep me in awe while hunting for secrets and a plethora of incentivisation improvements to the Power Level grind make Destiny 2 feel like the game I fell in love with again.  This quest for vengeance, which begins with a grandiose prison-break sequence filled with witty wisecracks, introduces you to new friends like an overweight Fallen crime boss named Spider and returning faces like fan-favorite Petra Venj. Each brings a welcome voice that adds a new mystery to the universe we thought we knew so well. Spider, specifically, acts as a catalyst to weave the Adventures right into the campaign by sending you on missions around the Tangled Shore. It\u2019s nice to see this adjustment in delivery, in contrast to the previous approach where it was easy to miss these side quests\u2019 stories about characters from the main storyline.  Now we chase down all the Barrons responsible for Cayde\u2019s death, and each of them comes to a head with an interesting boss battle featuring unique mechanics or challenges to overcome. One of my favorites is the Mindbender, who received a power buff for his part in the killing of our Vanguard hero and, with his new abilities, sends us on a chase into a hive-themed lair for the final fight.   I absolutely think that this is exactly how a raid encounter should be and I hope Bungie continues with this trend. \u201c I\u2019m going to talk a bit about the raid here and I\u2019ll do my best to avoid spoilers, but if you want to completely avoid them you\u2019ll want to skip over the next two paragraphs. The Last Wish raid begins with a few encounters that are fairly easy to complete with good team coordination, but the later missions have a level of intricacy to them that will push any team to their limits. As a fireteam, you need to know every part, be able to adjust to unforeseen changes to your plan, and work together to support each other. I absolutely think that this is exactly how a raid encounter should be and I hope Bungie continues with this trend. Even as players reach a higher Power Level in the coming weeks, the precision required to complete the challenge is going to be difficult to overcome \u2013 and that\u2019s only speaking for the PC, which is where I played. (It may be easier to pull off on PC, because according to Destiny Raid Report , after three days only seven groups on console were able to complete The Last Wish Raid while 68 have done it on PC.) The level of execution required needs to be flawless and a few mechanics will make things a little tougher for people using a controller as opposed to mouse and keyboard. For comparison, 761 teams completed Leviathan, Destiny 2\u2019s first raid, on the day it launched.  Every Bungie Game Ever Reviewed by IGN 19 Images The toughest encounter is easily the larger-than-life boss Riven, who has 13 eyes, six of which you need to remember and shoot at the same time. However, before you even get to her encounter you need to solve a puzzle involving one teammate carrying a ball that will reveal an image to only that player. A second player needs to look through a set of glass, find that picture within a field of 12 others intricate images, and direct the ball carrier verbally to that location so he can detonate the orb within a set amount of time. Both of these examples will force you to trust your teammates and ensure you\u2019re able to communicating effectively. The entire reason the raids in Destiny are my favorite parts of the experience is because of the camaraderie and precision you\u2019re ingrained with by the time you come out of these trials by fire victorious.  The investment system was slightly unbalanced at the launch of Destiny 2: Forsaken and that held back a lot of contenders from finishing the raid in week one. That\u2019s been contentious, but the idea that the raid is a special experience to work toward is something I, as a dedicated Destiny 2 player, like. However, with the new Powerful Engram system in play, if you\u2019re exceptionally unlucky your weekly engram could continually drop the incorrect item and hold you back from progressing. During the first two weeks of Destiny 2: Forsaken there have also been bugs that prevented some players from receiving a key item, called an offering, that held them back \u2013 or they had a bug that prevented them from being able to acquire more power early on. Thankfully, Bungie has acted quickly and fixed one issue immediately by offering a new weekly reset, and is also looking into what caused the Ascendant Blessing bug. Thankfully (as I\u2019m obsessive about my inventory space) I was never impacted by either of these issues. Since the world's first Raid completion there have been a few in-game changes to the Dreaming City, which is an interesting new approach for Bungie. Now a cutscene will play the first time you return, adding context and lore involving the Guardians who defeated the raid. It\u2019s an incredibly smart way to reward the efforts of those playing: an in-game effect everyone will see. \u201cBecoming Legend\u201d seems to be actually plausible now. The raid completion also unlocked a new Strike that offers more lore and backstory as to why this might not be the victory we\u2019d hoped for. One of the best ways Bungie has improved the Destiny 2 experience is by respecting your time. \u201c  It\u2019s a great example of how the excellent storytelling and gameplay extends to the new Strike missions. In the Warden of Nothing, you visit a new area of the prison where Cayde died. Rebellious inmates need to be put in check, and that sends you through an impressive sequence in which you have to dodge a train system while enemies lay in wait. But as you dive deeper in you\u2019ll also be greeted with moments of nostalgia designed to catch the attention of a longtime player of Destiny. Then, in the Hollowed Lair Strike, you face off against a boss that has some interesting mechanics, such as a beam that pulls you in and requires fast reactions to disable. It\u2019s a good way to teach you that not all bosses are simply bullet sponges waiting to die \u2013 some can actually put up a fight. The boss you\u2019re pursuing also challenges the idea of murdering his comrades and I liked that it questions our revenge motivations.   Potentially the best addition for Forsaken is an entirely new enemy type known as the Scorn. No more re-skins here, for once. The Scorn weren\u2019t initially that exciting to me because, at first glance, I\u2019d assumed they\u2019d behave like a variation on the Fallen, but that\u2019s not the case. Each character type reacts in a new way and visually it\u2019s quite clear that the new models got some tender loving care. For example, you can shoot the weapon the flaming Ravagers wield, causing a large explosion of fire that engulfs them and anyone nearby.  The main story wraps with an unsettling conclusion after about five or six hours, but then there\u2019s more to see in The Dreaming City once unlocked that will give longtime players a peek into some interesting backstory elements. Here you have access to new secrets, Petra Venj\u2019s unique bounties that encourage exploration of the tricky secrets as well as the toughest activities, and the wave-based challenge of the Blind Well. Thanks to the gaudy towers spewing out from rocky terrain covered in fog the location emits a feeling of mysticism from every corner. Once inside, the impressively modeled interiors clearly convey the feeling that a deity resides within, and while you\u2019ll have to discover its secrets for yourself I will say it\u2019s a big step up from the original four planets. The Dreaming City also surprised my by addressing one of my long-time gripes with the patrol system. The subtle change has actual NPCs in the world deliver the mini-quests to you, and I was delighted to see that Bungie thought of this small, but important gameplay system.  The main draw of The Dreaming City is the Blind Well, which feels very similar to Escalation Protocol or Destiny 1\u2019s Court of Oryx and Archon\u2019s Forge. I love hopping in with friends to take on the waves of enemies that flow in from all corners and require you to stay on your toes. A lot of loot drops and it\u2019s a great way to farm for items you may desire, but don\u2019t expect a Power Level jump for completion. There are a few distinctive mechanics, such as a Harmony buff that will allow you to drop the shields of certain enemies, but that\u2019s about it. All of these wave-based modes have been fun, but in order to get the full group participating it still requires some odd networking trickery I had hoped Bungie would\u2019ve addressed for Forsaken\u2019s launch. Once you\u2019re in and firing away there are a few rewards you\u2019ll get that make it worthwhile, but for the most part the loot pool is a somewhat sparse payoff to what\u2019s otherwise an enjoyable run.  All of these additions are complemented by a complete rework of the sandbox, with refinements that bring back what my crew and I loved about the first Destiny but found sorely lacking in Destiny 2 until now. Bungie has taken its old playground full of confusing mods, armor with boring perks, and bland PVP and revamped all of it to make everything more interesting. If you want to wield any crazy loadout, like three shotguns, you can do that now, which adds more flavor to the mix instead of mandating more practical options. Armor and weapons of the same type will have unique aspects that encourage you to keep different sets until you get that perfect drop. This makes Destiny 2 feel mysterious again, and each drop is exciting right now as it could be that perfect roll, or bring you one light level closer to the max. They\u2019ve also added a new weapon type: the bow. Nocking an arrow and lining up a headshot with the No Turning Back bow will result in an explosive pop as the explosive tip finishes off an enemy in spectacular fashion. The weapon play here just feels right and they\u2019ve done a great job at capturing what makes archery so fun while adding a bit of that Bungie weapon flair we all love.  The Crucible benefits the most from the sandbox changes. Not only has Bungie addressed the time-to-kill issue so many fans have been asking for adjustments to , but with the weapon and armor changes your rewards are better than ever and could directly impact your PVP performance. This will give you new things to strive toward should a particular weapon shine, or encourage you to figure out new counters which could prompt even more time in-game to earn said weaponry. Team up with a small group and you\u2019ll fare much better with coordinated attacks, but it\u2019s also rewarding to go solo into something like Rumble, where it\u2019s a free-for-all. There are a few overpowered pieces of armor, like Ursa Furiosa, which I\u2019ve seen allow up to four supers back to back. This is because it restores super energy when stopping damage. Thankfully, Bungie has a good track record of addressing imbalances like that quickly, and even if it doesn\u2019t, once players learn not to shoot defending Titans it could become a non-issue.  Gambit mode is another new addition and it truly is superb. Facing off in a mix of PVP and PVE challenges is exhilarating, and planning the appropriate strategy with my team gives me a great feeling of camaraderie and accomplishment. The goal is to kill enemies, grab the motes that drop, and throw them into a bank as fast as you can to spawn enemies and mess with the progress of your opponents. Deposit enough motes and an extremely powerful Primeval will spawn which your team needs to fill full of bullets before the opposition does. During this entire ordeal the opposing side will be able to invade and try to murder you. When successful, this will make the tricky Primeval regain its health. Gambit is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before and Bungie has again created one of the best experiences out there. While I usually focus on the power level grind I found myself enraptured in the experience of stopping invaders with my teammates, and melting final bosses with our carefully planned strategy that we implemented for an amazing streak of wins. It was extra rewarding because when you stay in any game mode you\u2019re also rewarded with power gains, armor drops, and new gear just for playing what you love the most.  I believe that one of the best ways Bungie has improved the Destiny 2 experience is by respecting your time. With Forsaken, you can do whatever you enjoy the most to level up, and it all of it feels like it\u2019s in a great place right now thanks to all the system changes. Also, the collection system allows you to see what you still need to acquire to complete a set of armor or weapons and it can all be grabbed from your inventory for some resources if it\u2019s from before Forsaken. Hopefully, Bungie will extend this to all of the new armor and weapons once it figures out what to do with random roll items.  Infusion is a controversial topic at the moment because gathering resources requires you to return to old destinations, but I actually think Bungie has been really smart about constantly rewarding you with the items you need for completing bounties, picking the resource up in the wild, doing public events, or any task at all. The masterwork core shortage is going to present a difficult choice for some, however. You\u2019ll need to carefully decide which weapons you\u2019re going to power up as this rare resource will make you take pause before blindly leveling all your gear. I prefer having tough decisions to make about what comes up with my power-level climb.   The collection system and some quests that require full armor sets meet another need for Destiny 2: exciting moments from getting loot. When I finally grabbed the last piece of gear for the Gambit set or Vanguard armor I was ecstatic. Not only had I completed a set, but I eagerly jumped into the next mission to give my reward a test run. That Triumph tab has also finally brought lore into Destiny 2 with compelling stories you can read at your leisure as you discover scannable items or dead ghosts in the wild. Bungie has even implemented a system called Bungie Rewards to give anybody who completes enough in-game challenges some real-world rewards. This incentive system links to the Bungie store, where you can now sign up for the chance at items for completing in-game challenges. For example, if you complete the Forsaken campaign before the end of September you\u2019ll get a copy of the soundtrack for free. There are also a ton of future rewards teased with \u201cComing Soon\u201d text and a description of new challenges. For example, acquiring the Ace of Spades weapon will be next, but the reward is obscured for now. It\u2019s amazing to see that Forsaken delivers a memorable story for casual fans and the depth the hardcore players like myself have been longing for. The entire Destiny experience in a great place for all right now. Stay tuned to IGN for more on Destiny 2 or check out our weekly show Fireteam Chat dedicated to all things Destiny."

        "id": "9d65c44cdb94675cd3e71420de8be408",
        "Content": "Guacamelee 2 often had me laughing out loud. And just as often, it had me gripping my controller and gritting my teeth, trying not to be too frustrated with myself as I learned the luchador skills needed to nail its most difficult platforming puzzles. But no matter what emotion it evoked, I loved nearly every minute of Drinkbox Studios\u2019 fantastic follow-up, which offers a smart evolution of its revered predecessor that only briefly feels overly familiar. Picking up with a helpful reminder of how Guacamelee ended (which I needed, because it was first released way back in 2013) the sequel returns with plenty of humor and a surprising but welcome bit of pathos at the start of its eight-hour adventure. I was surprised at how affected I was to see Juan enjoy a peaceful life at home with his wife, two kids, and a diet that has caused his fighting physique to be lost to time, only for his happiness \u2014 in every possible timeline imaginable \u2014 to be disrupted by a new evil, Salvador. Yes, Guacamelee 2 tackles the well-worn trope of multiple timelines converging and endangering all of existence, but approaches it through the clever lens of the Mexiverse. I initially groaned a bit at that name, but Guacamelee 2 is not content to let an amusing portmanteau be the extent of its joke. The central conceit of the sequel works so well because Drinkbox wholeheartedly tackles the idea of multiple timelines, playing into established characters from the first entry while also finding clever new ways to use those to twist the gameplay, like temporarily transforming the adventure into a simple, but amusing turn-based RPG. It feels like a natural extension of the dimension shifting introduced in the original, with both character and gameplay implications that often had me chuckling in between sections of challenging platforming. Guacamelee 2 actually gives its referential humor substance this time around. \u201c And Guacamelee 2 is consistently clever and funny. The original\u2019s humor is plentiful, but relies a little too much on tossing out as much referential humor as possible rather than making those references actually funny. Meme overload was a problem, and Drinkbox clearly recognized that and addressed it by adding depth to the gags. Posters referencing pop culture still populate Juan\u2019s Mexico, but they\u2019re more evergreen and less focused on squeezing a hammy joke onto a signboard. Instead, the referential humor comes in the form of gameplay interludes referencing classic and indie gaming hits ranging from The Unfinished Swan to even Guacamelee itself. It would be a shame to ruin them for you, but rest assured nearly every one of them had me laughing along to their clever twists. Those subversions often include a one-off gameplay hook that, while often played for laughs, inject some nice variety and are always worth seeing through to the end. 41 Images Guacamelee 2 does a great job of balancing all of this referential world-building with the beautiful, brightly colored style of the Mexiverse. I often found myself spending extra time in certain areas, flipping back and forth between the two realms just to experience the art styles of both the worlds of the living and the dead. From temples to the underworld to quiet pueblos pocketed by timeline-melding distortions, I adored watching the vibrancy of Juan\u2019s world pop with earthy browns and forested greens in the land of the living and bright blues and shocking streaks of pink in the land of the dead. Drinkbox finds clever ways of playing with Juan and other characters. \u201c And my investment in it only became greater thanks to some smart story choices. Drinkbox finds clever ways of playing with Juan, his cantankerous mentor Uay Chivo, and other established characters \u2013 so much so that I came away surprised by how much I gave a damn about what happened to Juan when he was pulled away from his own home timeline. The story does miss a step in its exploration of the villain, Salvador, though. He\u2019s initially set up to be a fascinating foil to Juan, but he only has a few paltry scenes in which to develop, including one incredibly exposition-heavy sequence that could have had so much more impact had Salvador and Juan interacted more often. That scene in particular sets up what should be a sympathetic character, only to end up feeling more forced than earned.  Mucha Lucha Thankfully, the adventure is filled with a host of challenging and satisfying platforming and combat, all culled from Juan\u2019s fighting style. It takes a little longer than I would have liked to reacquire his returning powers, which include suped-up headbutts, ground pounds, a reality-shifting ability, and more, but Drinkbox does a great job of peppering in a few new hooks alongside all of those moves. Guacamelee 2's platforming can be complex, but it never feels unfair. \u201c And I mean literal hooks \u2014 Juan can latch onto and launch from any number of eagle-shaped hooks strategically floating throughout the world. They add a new dimension to platforming, which, especially as the adventure goes on, can require some devilishly difficult timing. Jumping, punching, hook jumping, and dimension shifting all have to be strategically deployed to progress. Thankfully, the added complexity does not come at the cost of a sense of achievability. It\u2019s often tricky, but Guacamelee 2 always feels fair in its construction, and is reasonably forgiving thanks to frequent checkpoint saves. A missed platform or a death at the hands of a room full of foes always came down to my timing, never the way levels or combat scenarios were crafted. A series of skill trees do a nice job of forcing you to use the full gamut of Juan\u2019s moves in combat, but I would have liked to have seen more variance in Juan\u2019s human moveset. Because so much of it is carried over from the first game, it begins to feel like more of the same as the adventure wears on. The biggest mechanical additions are for Juan\u2019s chicken form, including an aerial dash, which can hilariously be used to ping-pong a chicken up or down a corridor. A subplot revolving around the chickens of Guacamelee offers a hilarious explanation, and while it\u2019s less essential to see that all the way through I absolutely recommend doing so. While it\u2019s a joy to explore Guacamelee 2 thanks to the clever writing snuck into every corner of the map, it\u2019s also a rewarding thrill to complete its platforming puzzles, which can be quite the challenge, but by no means impossible. More than once, rooms that had me dimension shifting to jump between walls while avoiding lava below and spikey gears working their way around the room tripped me up enough to require a few breaks and episodes of Steven Universe to clear my mind. The road to 100% offers several more hours of challenging, rewarding content. \u201c For those who want a bit more punishment, the road to 100% easily offers that with three or so more hours of optional content\u2026 depending on how often you die, of course. I easily died over a dozen times at each of the most difficult platforming challenges, including a few that required me to hit multiple eagle hooks while dimension shifting to activate them all, only to then turn into a chicken to float above spike beds, and then hop back to Juan\u2019s human form for more eagle hooks without missing a beat. But the work was worth it \u2014 not just for the extra treasure but for the pure satisfaction of overcoming its smartly designed obstacle courses, which forced me to master every one of Juan\u2019s skills in combination with one another. That always felt achievable thanks to how gradually it layers on new mechanics, which inform both the fighting and platforming simultaneously.  Tag Team Whether you\u2019re overcoming a difficult jump or a hallway full of undead foes, up to three friends can lend you assistance if needed. I played a couple hours with a co-op buddy, and the presence of another player can turn into a difficult, synchronized ballet of flying fists and leaping luchadors. Figuring out how to properly hop, dimension shift, and punch our way through together made me think about Guacamelee 2\u2019s puzzles in a new, fascinating way \u2014 he could handle dimension duties while I timed by jumps to his shifting, for example. That said, not all of these challenges are well-suited to multiple luchadors. Some of the most difficult parts demand perfect unity, and that\u2026 well, that\u2019s really hard to achieve in the later and optional challenges. It simply became easier to let my friend die as I coasted through a difficult corridor rather than spend so much time nailing down timing on a relatively easy obstacle. It\u2019s nice to have, but doesn\u2019t add anything significant to the satisfaction of toughing out Guacamelee 2\u2019s challenges alone."

        "Content": "[Editor's Note: This review and score replaces our original March 2016 review. Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]   Each time I start up a new farm in Stardew Valley or return to my 100-hour save on PC, I feel like I\u2019m going home. There\u2019s a comfort in Stardew Valley that I\u2019ve rarely found in other games. The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town, and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land\u2019s mysteries. Whether you want to farm, fish, fight monsters, craft, mine, become everyone\u2019s best friend, or do a little bit of everything, this farming adventure has plenty to offer. As we said in our original review , Stardew Valley \u201cbeautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements to create an intriguing, absorbing rural world,\u201d and it\u2019s only gotten better with each massive free update. Multiplayer, new items, buildings, farm types, events, and relationships give Stardew Valley an even better foundation and more of a reason to stick around past the coveted event in the third in-game year. The five new farm maps offer better focus for players than when Stardew Valley first launched. Each of the farms\u2019 designs encourages different types of work \u2013 farming, fishing, foraging, mining, and combat. Each map\u2019s activities are a relief from the grips of Joja Corporation, the cold, in-game company that encroaches on Pelican Town. Stardew Valley\u2019s story is a simple, yet satisfying one. You inherit your grandfather\u2019s farm after leaving the grind of your job with the Joja Corporation. Once settled on the farm, you then have to decide whether to support the local Joja Mart or rebuild the decaying community center. This conflict is the driving factor in the two or so years that span Stardew Valley\u2019s story, but once that\u2019s all completed, befriending and learning about the townspeople introduce other contained stories. The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch. \u201c The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch, though improving your relationship with each of them is rather superficial. All you have to do is give them presents they like twice a week to slowly earn their trust and affection. Giving them items they dislike can lower their affection level, so that at least encouraged me to try and figure out what each person enjoys most and to get creative with my gifts once I had some expendable resources well into my second year. That's right, Maru \u2014 you've been upgraded to pepper poppers. Despite the system\u2019s simplicity, it\u2019s still rewarding to learn about each person's dreams, passions, and challenges living in Stardew Valley. There\u2019s a friendly monster who just wants to sell his merchandise to nice people, an artist who\u2019s a little too shy to share her artwork, a bitter old man who\u2019s hesitant to make connections, a scientist who studies the valley\u2019s wildlife, and plenty other interesting folks.  After reaching certain friendship or romance levels, a special character scene plays if you catch them in the right time and place. The 12 romanceable characters have more scenes than others, and if you choose to marry one, they move into your home and actually help around the farm every now and then. It\u2019s a welcome benchmark for the late game. NPCs are also the key to learning certain food recipes and crafting blueprints, so there\u2019s value in befriending them beyond discovering their interests and personal conflicts. They\u2019ll even send a small gift back to you occasionally. Sprouting Charm The changing of seasons in Stardew Valley is perhaps one of the most exciting events. Where summer has plenty of sunny days with a few useful thunderstorms here and there \u2013 with the right tools, you can make batteries with the lighting! \u2013 the snow-covered ground in winter prevents any crops growing outside, leaving the season\u2019s activities a little more up in the air if you\u2019re primarily a farmer. Every season has its own enjoyable pace that comes with the varying weather, crop types, NPC schedules, birthdays, fish, and fun festivals that keep things engaging. Each season runs for 28 days, so figuring out how to best spend them is a great challenge as each in-game year passes. By the time I reached the end of my second year, I felt confident in my daily routine and farming strategies. Farming isn\u2019t overly complex, but the methodical nature of it is relaxing. It does take a fair bit of time in the first year to make enough money to get a good number of the best seeds, optimize your farmland, implement a watering system, and figure out a routine to take care of it all. Stardew Valley has levels for each main mechanic \u2013 farming, fishing, mining, combat, and foraging. Figuring out how to make the most of my days was a great challenge early on when I had a low energy meter for executing actions like chopping wood, tilling soil, and using the watering can, all without extra farming bonuses from my level. But even when that energy meter grew and I earned farming specializations, the difficulty and enjoyment I found in farming came from managing more land and deciding whether or not to process the farmed goods to make them into more profitable artisan goods or do something else with them entirely. For instance, I could sell all my grapes, cook them for my own consumption for energy and health, or I could save them to make jelly or wine with the craftable preserves jar and keg. Adding farm animals to the mix made for even more welcome diversity in my daily farming routine. Even with the big updates, Stardew Valley still has the mild problem of having so much to do with little explanation for how to do it, but there certainly is a joy to creating your own routines and discovering what works best for how you want to play. The in-game TV show Living off the Land provides good tips on mechanics and seasonal changes, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of help on how to use some of the less straightforward items. For instance, a great new item picks up all products from goats, cows, and sheep, but I had to use a guide to figure out how to actually get it to work. On the other hand, new items like the planter pot make the early game a little easier. It allows the player to grow any plant per pot indoors regardless of the season, making it especially helpful for completing some early important challenges and requests from villagers that are easy to miss once a season ends. When I wasn\u2019t farming or petting farm animals, I was foraging for the season\u2019s natural goods (which is as simple as walking around and picking them off the ground) or fishing. Stardew Valley tracks everything you\u2019ve had in your collection, so there\u2019s definitely an incentive to try each main activity. Unlike farming, where you need to buy seeds to grow the next thing on the list, there\u2019s a strict schedule to when certain fish are available, and some of them are incredibly difficult to catch. The fishing minigame itself is easygoing fun for the small fries but can be a little frustrating for some of the more rare fish. Still, that challenge is something I\u2019m looking forward to conquering eventually once I craft enough of the right tackles and stock up on bait to lure the rare beasts in. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I\u2019m very into it. \u201c Mining and combat, on the other hand, are a little more straightforward. The main mine has a handful of enemies that progressively get stronger with each of its 100 levels, and an additional cavern in an unlockable area houses even more difficult monsters and a seemingly infinite number of floors. Spelunking through the main cave is a dangerous endeavor early on, but obtaining better weapons and armor through the shop, chests, enemy drops, or through reaching new combat levels make it more manageable. The combat consists of simple button mashing to swing a sword, so pairing monster fights with the challenge of descending into a mine makes it a lot more fun and rewarding. The added difficulty of getting out of the mine before your character passes out at 2:00 a.m. also puts the pressure on for making it through the caves as efficiently as possible. Then, there are challenges from a group called the Adventurer's Guild to clear a certain number of the more popular monster types, so there\u2019s yet another incentive to descend the mines to slay monsters. Oh, and there\u2019s even more collecting involved as you mine old and strange artifacts that can be donated to the local museum for even more rewards. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I\u2019m very into it. Regardless of their varying complexity, progression through all five skills is constant and rewarding. In addition to that basic fulfillment, just about every skill level has some sort of craftable reward and helps build your proficiency, or lowers the amount of energy required to use a tool. At skill levels five and 10, you get to specialize your character further by choosing professions that give bonus stats to certain actions. For example, a rancher gets more gold from animal products, but tillers sell crops at a higher price. That profession is refined further at level 10. I\u2019m halfway into my third year in Stardew Valley and I still haven\u2019t finished getting all my skills to level 10. Like with real life, there\u2019s potential to do a lot in a day, but how it\u2019s spent is entirely up to you. When you add someone else to your farm, though, those days can be a whole lot more productive. Ripened Co-Op Multiplayer is a fantastic addition to Stardew Valley that entirely changes how the game can be played. As expected, it helps you accomplish far more in a day if you have a cooperative farmhand, but does so without feeling too much like a cheat code. When a friend joins they get their own home (that the main player can enter and customize) and have to start a new character from scratch. This means they have low energy, weak starting tools, hardly any crafting recipes, and no skill perks. While it would have been nice to have the option to import a character with all its stats and upgraded tools \u2013 maybe even at a cost \u2013 starting fresh is the more balanced trade-off for having multiple people on a farm. You share money with up to three farmhands/friends who can meddle in your belongings, so it\u2019s not entirely too difficult to get new players up to speed if you\u2019re adding them to an established farm. Still, having to support others\u2019 endeavors out of your pocket helps multiplayer maintain that balance between difficulty and power, and you can even change the profit margins for your co-op save if you feel like you\u2019re making too much money. The updates added some incredibly useful but expensive items, so I definitely haven't complained about making more gold every day. If you\u2019re starting a new farm together, I could see how splitting up each task could make that first challenging year easier to take on, and maybe even more fun. Someone who prefers to fish or mine could focus on that while someone who likes farming could look after the crops.  Farmhands have ownership over their cabin and relationships with NPCs in your game, too, which is an important incentive for helping out a friend on their farm since it gives them both a stake in your land and in the rest of your game, too. They can upgrade their home and even get married to your character or an NPC you haven\u2019t romanced. It might be a bit tedious to have to go through the whole courting process again if you\u2019ve already unlocked everything on your primary farm, but I appreciate that it offers a chance to start a new romance with a different character and to essentially establish a new life on a farm that can progress while you\u2019re not there if the primary farmer chooses to play without you. My friend was incredibly helpful in kicking off the summer farming season as we toiled away for days leading up to it, calculating how many seeds of a specific fruit we\u2019d need. Communication happens through a simple in-game text chat that\u2019s equipped with plenty of great emojis. It ended up being an expensive season because of all the seeds I had to buy, but that investment my friend suggested has definitely paid off. Though his farming suggestions were helpful, spelunking with him was even more fun. Together we slayed plenty of monsters and got further in the challenge cavern than I had before. The easygoing nature of Stardew Valley also creates a wonderfully pleasant space to hang out with friends, which is a nice thing to have when so many multiplayer games are set in rather tense situations."

        "Title": "Monster Hunter: World for PC Review",
        "Content": "Monster Hunter: World initially seemed destined to be one of those game of the year candidates that, due to a January release, would be forgotten about when all the lists rolled around 12 months later. Thankfully, the promised PC port has finally appeared, and it\u2019s set to reignite that discussion.  When it first arrived on Xbox One and PS4, I wrote:  \u201cWorld takes a dramatic leap into a look, feel, and size that feels truly new, simultaneously staying true to the series\u2019 ideals by maintaining the addictive loop of combat, intimidating monsters and meaningful upgrades that fans love. The sheer depth and commitment required is still intense, but it clearly isn\u2019t Capcom\u2019s aim to court a casual crowd. This is as all-consuming and incredible a ride as ever.\u201d Read our original Monster Hunter: World review.  Brilliantly, Monster Hunter\u2019s first western foray onto PC is a near-perfect recreation of that console experience I fell in love with last winter.  Every IGN Monster Hunter Review 12 Images  Those hoping this release would be Capcom\u2019s excuse to add the much-loved G-rank challenges will be disappointed, but this remains the stupendously generous game it always was, with hundreds of hours of play in store for those that become entranced by its web of quests and upgrades. In fact, those returning having dropped off from playing earlier console versions will find a more welcoming experience. Months of updates saw Capcom fixing some of our few complaints about the launch version, from being able to sort the endless lists of Investigation quests to changing text size and adding more options to farm certain useful items. It\u2019s not drastically different, but it\u2019s definitely more efficient.  While all the console versions\u2019 quality of life improvements have made their way across, PC players will have to wait a little while to get the content updates that came post-launch. New monsters like Deviljho and Lunastra will be added at a later date - but in a game that takes at least 100 hours to finish the basic storylines, that isn\u2019t a huge problem.  The true benefit of playing on PC is, predictably, in the performance. Playing the game at the \u2018Highest\u2019 level of quality doesn\u2019t outstrip what we\u2019ve seen on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X but, as you\u2019d expect, you aren\u2019t forced to choose between higher resolution, graphical quality and frame rate here. The result is a game that looks as good as on the most powerful console, but runs without a hitch (and, with an uncapped frame rate option for those with beefier machines, even better than the original). Read more about Monster Hunter World's performance on PC.   While it\u2019d take a more powerful PC than mine to run with every setting maxed, in hours of play at 1080p, 60 FPS at max quality with a GTX 1070, I\u2019ve not seen a hint of the frame rate dips that hit every console version. Capcom\u2019s hinted that it may release a PC-exclusive graphical improvement patch post-release but, even without, this is no slouch.  Speaking of patches, you may have heard about a pre-release version of the port crashing regularly. Thankfully, a pre-release fix seems to have eliminated that issue. Despite suffering multiple crashes pre-patch, I\u2019ve had none in the hours I\u2019ve played of the release version.  PC\u2019s other major addition is keyboard and mouse play. While this works far better than I\u2019d assumed it would, and feels like something of a novelty, I\u2019d still recommend a controller. Monster Hunter\u2019s combat requires pinpoint timing at the best of times, and using its more complex weapons can feel like more of a dance across a keyboard than it perhaps should. That said, with some input remapping, I can see the game\u2019s ranged weapons becoming more usable on keyboard and mouse, offering real precision, but the default control scheme just isn\u2019t there.",

        "Content": "When I initially reviewed Rocket League on PlayStation 4 and PC in 2015, and Xbox One in 2016, I gave it an 8.0 for \u201cGreat.\u201d Here\u2019s what I said then: \u201cWhether it\u2019s online casual or ranked matches, no-pressure exhibitions, split-screen local co-op with up to four players, or an intense 36-week season mode, Rocket League is all about getting into the next throttle-pounding match as fast as possible. Unfortunately, servers are still struggling, which means your mileage may vary day-to-day when it comes to online features. But the silver lining is the mostly formidable AI can make even offline matches interesting and tense. The execution of this simple idea is so strong and so engaging that it keeps bringing me back, time and time again, for just one more match.\u201d ( Read the archived original Rocket League review .) Now, nearly three years later and with all the additional updates, features, and new platforms (including the newly launched Nintendo Switch version), Psyonix\u2019s insane formula of rocket-powered cars playing sports has only gotten better with age. The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn\u2019t changed a bit. The rules are simple: two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy, brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. A game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. \u201c But there\u2019s a golden layer of strategy and mechanical depth tucked inside the chaotic mashing of metal. Timing a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick to connect with the ball and send it sailing at a precise angle takes notable skill. Those basics, when coupled with expert teamplay and mind-blowing booster-powered aerial maneuvers, solidify Rocket League as a game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. At launch, the content around that gameplay felt a little barebones. Since then, though, it\u2019s been substantially fleshed out with smart alternate modes that emphasize different skills and add variety. The Snow Day hockey mode substitutes a dense, oversized puck for the bouncier soccer ball; Hoops is a basketball variant emphasizing aerial play; Dropshot is a two-sided floor-breaking mode; and Rumble mode deals out power-ups that disrupt players and influence the ball. It\u2019s all a ton of fun. And of course, the competitive playlist for the traditional 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 shines as the great ladder system Rocket League was missing to bring some-term goals to its pick-up-and-play ease, offering seasonal cosmetic rewards and bragging rights as you try to climb through the ranked tiers. Decisions, Decisions Overall, Rocket League remains a balanced multiplayer playing field. While the mechanical differences between the free cars and the large assortment of paid-for downloadable cars are noticeable, they\u2019re barely relevant. Sure, some cars turn slightly faster, some have better hitboxes for flipping, but these small differences only really matter at the highest levels of competition, where a few modest purchases don\u2019t seem like too much to ask. The cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. \u201c Serious players have their go-to speedsters, but even with the continuous influx of brand-associated cars you can purchase and use, you\u2019re still totally effective on the field. That\u2019s a list that includes the Batmobile, a DeLorean, and the platform-exclusive cars like the Mario/Luigi-mobile, Halo's Warthog, or Sweet Tooth's ice cream truck. Meanwhile, the cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. With everything from customizable goal explosions to player banners, there are innumerable combinations that allow you to truly stand out, and almost all of it can be earned just by playing. There\u2019s some grinding, sure, but you\u2019re always rewarded, and even duplicate items can be stacked up and traded in for items of better quality using a rudimentary crafting system that adds another layer to the appeal of collecting cosmetics. And yes, Rocket League does come with loot crates that you earn for playing online matches (roughly one every 10 hours of play), but here they\u2019re used relatively inoffensively and can be completely toggled off in the options menu when setting up a game. You can't purchase them with real money, so there's no real pay-to-win element \u2013 especially since these items don't actually do anything other than make you look rad. Instead, they're more like optional rewards you get for grinding out online matches that you can open if you decide to spend $1.50 for a key (or $1 each if you buy in bulk). If you don\u2019t want to spend money at all, you can still get at the contents of these boxes by participating in special, limited-time events that award you keys just for playing more Rocket League. Your Platform Mileage May Vary The sheen on Rocket League\u2019s sleek, neon-coated look varies by platform. On everything but Switch, it runs from the standard 1080p all the way up to 4K on PS4 Pro and PC right now. (4K and HDR support is confirmed to be coming soon to Xbox One X.) Visually, you can\u2019t really go wrong with any version, since Psyonix has made efforts to ensure that you\u2019re always getting 60 frames per second in one- and two-player local splitscreen game modes on most maps. But maintaining that frame rate comes at a price on the Switch, which runs a resolution of around 526p in handheld, and 720p while docked. Blown up on a decently sized TV, you can easily see a lot of rough, jagged lines and edges, both during matches and even in menus, and missing visual effects in arenas. That said, in handheld mode it\u2019s incredibly cool to be able to play Rocket League no matter where you are in a portable enough form that beats the hell out of carrying a laptop and a controller around. But the small screen in portable mode makes it difficult to be as precise, and I regularly found I had a harder time nailing those precise angles that become second nature over time. And that becomes much worse when trying to play local split-screen on the Switch in tabletop mode - half of a small screen is almost comical. While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go \u2013 which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode \u2013 the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent on all platforms."

        "Content": "As a series, Total War tends to give its best when building on an already established foundation. Napoleon surpassed Empire, Attila surpassed Rome 2. And so, in faithful fashion, has Total War: Warhammer 2 pushed beyond the original Total War Warhammer, creating the most fleshed-out and engrossing campaign this veteran strategy and tactics series has offered to date. The standard trappings are all present in top form. A sprawling campaign map that\u2019s possibly the best-looking one Creative Assembly\u2019s artists have ever put together. Real-time battles with reasonably competent AI (not always a given for Total War) who seem to know how to play to each army\u2019s strengths and weaknesses \u2013 if only in a pre-set, somewhat predictable way. You build cities and research tech to unlock new units and improve your economy and fighting capacity, with each of the new factions having a fairly innovative way of doing so. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Those factions are the headliners of this battle royale: four extremely distinct and fun to command armies that bring new ideas to the campaign and the real-time battles. The enigmatic Lizardmen (whom I\u2019ve spent the most time with) have access to a combination of rampaging dinosaurs and highly potent magic to the field. Their mid- and high-tier units present interesting tactical considerations in each battle in the question of where and when to commit to the melee, since they\u2019re prone to going into a rampage state and deciding they don\u2019t need your stupid orders once they\u2019re in the thick of it. On the campaign map, the Lizardmen are probably the least interesting of the four: maintaining the sprawling Geomantic Web that powers their highly powerful province edicts forces you to play wide, even while your major objectives contradictingly encourage you to circle the wagons and defend the core of your empire. Watching the High Elves in action is like Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings films.The High Elves and their edgier Dark Elf cousins are about as far from reskins of one another as you can get, despite their shared heritage in the lore. High Elf armies fill a niche that none of the previous factions really could, with a focus on small, expensive units that each represent the very peak of discipline and martial excellence. Watching a unit of High Elf Swordmasters hold a charge is satisfyingly reminiscent of the prelude to Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings films, with flashing swords cutting effortlessly through the varied horrors assailing their line. Their campaign mechanics mainly deal with Influence, a currency earned mainly through making choices in court intrigue events that can be spent to bolster or sabotage relations between any two factions. That provides a delightfully thematic avenue for the High Elves to start wars without ever firing an arrow. It\u2019s the one area of diplomacy that the Total War series has gotten right lately. label=It's%20Good%20To%20Be%20Bad High Elves don\u2019t have much of a stomach for blood, though, and fight the hardest at the beginning of a battle before they\u2019ve started to take casualties and get blood on their expensive cuirasses. Dark Elves, in stark contrast, become more deadly the more viscera has been spilled. They have a focus on wicked, frenzied units that evoke the sinister, un-Disneyfied versions of Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales. In keeping with that cruel theme, they have a habit of taking slaves after each victory, who can either be put to work to improve your economy or sacrificed to gain bonuses \u2013 including the ability to summon floating cities called Black Arks that can move around the seas and recruit units. Skaven are highly interesting to play, both as and against.But the centerpiece of the whole operation are the Skaven, and they\u2019re one of the most truly different factions I\u2019ve ever handled in a Total War game. They\u2019re not quite a horde, but also not quite a settled faction, inhabiting ruins that the enemy can only identify as settlements by sending an army to investigate them. This allows them to hide their most important strategic assets in plain sight, which makes Skaven highly interesting to play, both as and against. They also have a corruption mechanic similar to Vampires and Chaos, with the wrinkle that building it up too high hurts them just as much as their neighbors. Thus, you\u2019re incentivized to get what you can out of a region and then ditch it when the rat poo reaches about waist-high, taking advantage of the Skaven ability to settle an empty ruin and build it immediately into a fully upgraded city by expending their unique Food resource. Their roster focuses on swarms of cheap units supported by powerful specialists like the hilarious and deadly Doomwheel, and is a great fit for players like me who normally have a hard time throwing lives away to get the job done. Somehow I don\u2019t mind sending awful rat creatures to their doom. label=New%20World%2C%20New%20Rules When attempting to take full advantage of all these new faction mechanics, combined with the ability to explore ruins and shipwrecks, powerful rites that can be activated for strong temporary bonuses, and the overarching battle for control of the Vortex that determines victory, the amount of micromanagement can start to feel overwhelming. The theme of Warhammer 2\u2019s campaign seems to be that you\u2019ll never sit around hitting End Turn while waiting for buildings and armies to finish, which is an improvement from the lulls in the first game. But there was definitely an adjustment period where I had to learn that prioritizing a few things was a better idea than to try to play with all the shiny new toys at once. The interface has also seen some major improvements, notably in the ability to zoom directly from the 3D campaign map to the strategic overview without having to open a separate menu. There\u2019s still a lot of room for growth here, though. You still can\u2019t initiate diplomacy by clicking on a faction\u2019s cities or units, for instance. And diplomacy itself remains decidedly behind most other modern strategy games in its versatility: wars are still all-or-nothing affairs, an end to which can only be negotiated with an exchange of cash and each side keeping what they\u2019ve captured. But Creative Assembly is on the right track, taking baby steps toward a decent diplomacy system. Every IGN Total War Review Ever 20 Images As cool as the factions are, The Great Vortex campaign itself is this sequel\u2019s greatest triumph. As the major factions race to complete rituals that represent distinct milestones on the path to victory \u2013 and sabotage one another in the process \u2013 the world grows more hectic and dangerous while new pieces of a simple but effective story with an interesting twist are revealed through well voiced and animated cinematics. Total War has always struggled to make the endgame interesting for powerful player empires, and while the Chaos Invasion in Total War: Warhammer was a decent attempt to correct this, the Vortex campaign\u2019s increasing application of external pressure and tense, final set-piece battle make it look amateurish. As an added bonus, you\u2019re able to play against the original Total War: Warhammer factions in multiplayer and skirmishes if you own both games. There\u2019s also a new multiplayer mode that allows free-for-all battles involving more than two teams, which fits great with the general chaos and mayhem of Warhammer. Just be warned that four, full-strength armies can require a beefy PC to keep up with \u2013 especially if the numerous Skaven are involved."

        "Content": "While PES 2018 is undoubtedly an improvement over its predecessor, don\u2019t expect the same leap in quality achieved by PES 2017. Instead, this year\u2019s effort builds on the superb foundation of the previous game, consolidating its gains and focusing on further satisfying its core audience. Simply, if you liked PES 2017 you\u2019re going to find plenty to adore here in regards to the extra depth and variety added to the on-pitch action, plus a number of small tweaks made to the likes of Master League mode. But if you\u2019re thinking of switching from FIFA, take note - no concession has been made to try and appease those who are not already fans of the formula PES employs. In a way not overly dissimilar to a fighting game sequel, PES 2018 feels like an exercise in not wanting to undermine or distort the sublime balance the previous incarnation managed to achieve. As such, there\u2019s a certain familiarity to the bulk of the headline features. Real Touch+ is an elaboration of PES 2017\u2019s Real Touch feature, which improved a player\u2019s first touch and provided them better awareness in positioning themselves to shield the balls from opponents and bringing it under control. With Real Touch+, the core concept remains but now the whole body is brought into play. Players use thighs, shoulders, stomach, chest and the entire foot \u2013 front, side and back \u2013 to control the ball, and the result is imperfect passes have a better chance of finding their target, as players have more ways to interact with passes coming towards them. If you liked PES 2017 you\u2019re going to find plenty to adore here. \u201c This diversity of interaction adds a palpable sense of visual drama to matches and goes a long way to making things look closer to what you\u2019d expect to see on TV. It also ups the spectacle, and passing combinations such knocks and flicks, with body parts other than a foot, are flattering for even a beginner. Naturally, players with the highest \u2018ball control\u2019 rating \u2013 Lionel Messi, Luka Modric, Neymar Jr \u2013 benefit most, but its influence is apparent throughout the game at every level. Playing as Real Madrid - dubbed \u2018MD White\u2019 this year, thanks to the ongoing licensing war with FIFA - I was trying to intercept a pass using Casemiro (ball control 78) when he nudged the ball with his heel to knock it away from an onrushing Antoine Griezmann. It might not sound like much on paper, but the effect in the heat of the game is genuinely exciting to see. This greater ability to bring the ball under control feeds into improvements to how players move both their body and the ball when dribbling, especially at lower speeds. Players visibly shift their weight to change direction more suddenly and tempt defenders into making a wrong move, while a range of feints and delicate touches help make space for a shot in crowded penalty areas. Again, the better the player, the more impact these kinds of dribbling options have, but the real skill rests in how creative you are in stringing together the available moves. Every IGN Pro Evolution Soccer Review Ever 28 Images Goalkeepers improved a lot last year, but their effectiveness has taken a step backward this season. Their dives are often spectacular and when they make a great save it\u2019s impossible to not be impressed. Too often though, they make poor decisions and fumble weak shots. Timid strikes from long range are fumbled too frequently, especially when the keeper has a clean line of sight and plenty of time to position himself. They also have a tendency to spill seemingly simple saves back out towards the penalty spot, leaving for an easy tap in. Thankfully keepers\u2019 performances don\u2019t ruin games, but sometimes their actions are awkward enough that you\u2019re left cursing their performance and impact on the final result. Off the pitch, menu screens remain as ugly as you\u2019ll find in any game. Boorish grey blocks filled with plain black text do little to promote the excitement and allure of the world\u2019s richest and most popular sport, which is a shame as some of the content hidden within these menus represent an upgrade on PES 2017. Random Selection Match is arguably the star of the new game modes over last year, giving you the option of playing with a team made of up of randomly assigned players, based on set parameters determined before the match. You can set up to three categories from which your team will be chosen: teams, leagues and nationality. For instance, if you want to give yourself the best chance of using a team of superstars then you might want to limit your random players to being selected only from Real Madrid and Barcelona. Certainly, you\u2019re going to have a better team from that combination then you\u2019re going to if you allow the game to select from all players in the French, English, Spanish and Italian second divisions. Once your players have been assigned to you there exists the option to trade personnel with your opponent, turning Random Selection into a draft mode of sorts. This can get particularly interesting if you\u2019re lacking in a certain key position - such as striker, for example. It\u2019s a great mode to use when playing with a group of friends well-versed in the game - the random element forces you to both experiment with new ideas and be prepared to adapt to players you\u2019ve never seen or used before. Random Selection Match is arguably the star of the new game modes over last year. \u201c Depending on their performance in real-life, players receive live stat updates inline with their form. This adds further interest to Random Selection, and other exhibition game modes, in that a player you previously discarded might have a blinding week for their club and is now forcing themselves into consideration for your PES team. Keep an eye on those stat changes before making any final lineup and formation decisions. The new addition of Online Co-op is also worth spending serious time mastering, with teams of three players facing off against one another. It\u2019s here that the tactical side of PES 2018 shines, with quality sets of partners able to simultaneously park the bus with their defence and overload in attack. The AI on offer by default is intelligent enough to keep you entertained, but it\u2019s no replacement for practised, experienced human players and online co-op is apt demonstration of that. Elsewhere, multiplayer modes include the returning Online Divisions; a competition in which you face off against other real players in short seasons, with you being relegated or promoted depending on your match results. Invariably, the more often you\u2019re promoted the better your opponents become. If you\u2019re looking to test yourself against the most serious of PES player then the ultra competitive PES League is for you, whilst casual fans should stick to standard versus matches. MyClub straddles both online and offline arenas. The idea - much like FIFA Ultimate Team - is to acquire new players and build the squad of your dreams. Very little has changed over last season\u2019s offering, although a tutorialised introduction makes it easier for newcomers to understand more quickly. As ever, it remains a mode that only satisfies if you\u2019ve got hours upon hours to dedicate to it. Timid strikes from long range are fumbled too frequently, especially when the keeper has a clean line of sight. \u201c Master League remains the showpiece offline mode, with a new option to increase the difficulty of managing your club\u2019s off-the-field dealings revealing itself a welcome addition. Choose the \u2018Challenge\u2019 difficulty setting when starting a new game and fresh faces become hard to sign, your current squad is more likely to want to leave if things go wrong and, ultimately, keeping your job is less straightforward. Challenge mode is hardly akin to a Football Manager experience, but it does force you to think about the makeup of your squad over the longer term and that influences your overall approach accordingly. Elsewhere the usual selection of individual cup and league competitions are available for you to win and lose, as is Become A Legend, in which you control a single player and try to make it to the top and achieve glory. Unfortunately, Become A Legend is as stale as it\u2019s always been and limiting yourself to controlling a single player when so many of the game's improvements focus on linking a team together seems counterproductive. Considering the existence of FIFA 17\u2019s imperfect-but-interesting The Journey single-player mode \u2013 and its follow-up in FIFA 18 \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to see Become A Legend anything other than entirely redundant as a serious option for enjoying modern football games.  There are also a few minor issues with server quality in online matches, predominantly when going through the matchmaking process. It can take some time to find an opponent, an issue that is made worse if playing in co-op and seeking multiple players to join your match. Matches themselves have been more stable than previous PES releases on launch, with only a small percentage of fixtures affected by lag. Hopefully any and all issues will be ironed out as Konami reacts to server load. PES 2018 is not without its faults then, but many are easy to forgive because it does a wonderful job of consolidating and evolving on the fantastic groundwork laid by its predecessor. The improvements may not make headlines, but they do make for one of the most complete and satisfying football games. True, it\u2019s a game that benefits from serious time being dedicated to it, in order to learn all of its possibilities. As such, it\u2019s not easy to recommend PES 2018 to the casual football game fan. But for those serious about diving in and soaking up all there is to know about Konami\u2019s beautiful game, you will not find yourself disappointed."

Booting up StarCraft Remastered isn\u2019t too far off from living that nostalgia fantasy. It takes an all-time classic RTS and makes it look like my fond memories of it, rather than how it actually looked. Other than that, the amazing campaign and competitive gameplay are almost completely unchanged, which is exactly what the esports community wants, but slightly annoying for casual players accustomed to modern conveniences like working pathfinding AI. When I say StarCraft Remastered looks really good, I don\u2019t need to qualify that with: \u201cGood for a 19-year-old game.\u201d Blizzard\u2019s art team has created units and maps that are about as detailed as I could hope for from a sprite-based isometric style. Even common units like Marines pop against the background, easily mistakable for full 3D models in their shining, bulbous armor. Zooming in - which is now a thing you can do! - lets you count the spines on a hydralisk\u2019s head. Modifications to how terrain is rendered give a depth and sense of place to aged maps. And with Dynamic Lighting turned on, the glow effect on an archon\u2019s attacks actually casts light on nearby units. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You can zoom in now! \u201c That new art is applied to all of the modes from the 1998 original and its Brood War expansion, which have been expertly updated. Campaign missions are preceded by new, full-3D talking portraits in the ready rooms, each of which has also gotten a spectacular makeover. A functional improvement over the original version is that ranked multiplayer has added a visible ELO number that goes up and down after each win or loss. Matchmaking, at least in these first few days, has been more stable and much, much quicker than ranked play in StarCraft 2 currently is. And most importantly for me, the hundreds of amazing and hilarious custom maps that used to take up most of my StarCraft time are compatible with the Remaster, and it\u2019s never hard to find a variety of maps to play. The downside of Blizzard\u2019s dedication to reproducing a better-looking version of the original StarCraft is that it didn\u2019t fix any of the long-standing quirks. The unit pathfinding is still frustratingly bad, especially for large units like Protoss Dragoons and Zerg ultralisks. Certain aspects of the interface haven\u2019t aged that well either. Trying to select 12 specific units out of a larger group rarely gets you the result you wanted, and you still have to open a separate menu to see mission objectives in the campaign. The story holds up surprisingly well. \u201c I also found myself missing some of the better features of StarCraft 2, like Protoss warp-ins and the ability to cue up building orders. In some ways, like general balance and its de-emphasis on death balls, the original is still superior to the sequel. But ultimately, while I\u2019m having a ton of fun playing, I don\u2019t think it will replace StarCraft 2 as my go-to RTS of choice for everyday Zerg-blasting. I understand why adding quality of life features that alter the gameplay would have been a disaster for the established esports scene, where managing the old interface is part of the challenge competitors have trained almost 20 years for, but as a less competitive RTS player I\u2019m also pulled in the opposite direction every time I have to painstakingly set up six control groups just to move my army across the map. The story, on the other hand, holds up really well. While it lacks the high-grade presentation of StarCraft 2\u2019s campaign, it also feels grittier, grounded, and unique. The issues at play are made more compelling for not revolving around the fate of the entire galaxy and an interdimensional demon\u2026 or something... and the focal point is instead on the grunts in the mud. The politics and turns of fortune that weave through each of the six episodes reminded me that setting the stakes to something other than 11 can often allow you to tell a better tale."

        "Content": "\u201cThe one constant through all the years...has been baseball.\u201d Or, to frame James Earl Jones\u2019s Field of Dreams quote in another way, baseball is a game that stubbornly sticks to tradition. New rules like pitch clocks aren\u2019t rushed into practice without years of deliberation. With the sport itself remaining relatively static, it\u2019s hard to fault MLB The Show 17 for maintaining its deliberate march toward perfection. Yet, last year, the game took its biggest step this generation, with major additions to the career mode and a total revamp of its card-based Diamond Dynasty. For a series that seems to constantly tweak and not rebuild features, these changes were a big deal. Certainly, I thought, a second year of huge upgrades would be asking too much. However, I was surprised to find that MLB The Show 17 does, in fact, take major strides to make the game more authentic and, in turn, more fun. Hits and Highlights The expectations are set high early, with a surprisingly good opening video; it\u2019s definitely worth watching at least once. From there, the menus have been given a fresh look. They continue to be easy to navigate and put the stuff used most often right up front. In-game, lighting has been improved, which is especially notable after the attention it has received over the past few years. Day games are especially vibrant. I continue to be impressed by the MLB The Show 17\u2019s ability to communicate the time of day and year based solely on changes in the sky and lighting. The game is full of new animations, which do more than look nice. They have a definite impact on how you and the AI play the game. For instance, infielders read the runners in order to put an appropriate amount of velocity on their throws. No longer will you see a runner beat out a throw because the fielder casually took too long. In the outfield, defenders don\u2019t take robotically precise routes to the ball anymore. I\u2019ve seen outfielders get a poor jump on a fly ball, then compensate and make a great catch. I\u2019ve also witnessed a fielder close in too quickly to the ball, only to watch it skip to the wall for extra bases. These animations are very subtle sometimes, but noticeable if you\u2019ve been a regular fan of the series. Add to these new animations a large increase in hit variety, and you\u2019ve got a very authentic looking and playing baseball game. Sony touted a big jump in the number of different types of hits you can get, and they didn\u2019t exaggerate. Floating line drives, spinning grounders, and wind-blown fly balls look and act very realistically. My favorite type of hits to watch are bloop singles that fall just out of reach of any fielder. I don\u2019t recall seeing this type of hit in past versions of The Show. Our National Pastime All the Time New MLB Network broadcast elements also increase the game\u2019s authenticity. One particularly neat aspect is Showtrack, a stat-driven overlay that appears on some replays. For example, I hit a long home run and was treated with an illustration of the path of the ball, exit velocity, hang time, and distance. It looks exactly like something you\u2019d see on TV. If there\u2019s one complaint regarding the presentation of MLB The Show 17, it\u2019s that the transitions reveal some framerate issues. To be fair, these are the only performance hiccups I\u2019ve seen so far, playing on a regular PS4 and standard HDTV. The MLB Network stuff also brings new commentary, thanks to on-air personalities Harold Reynolds and Dan Plesac. Initially, I felt that there wasn\u2019t a lot of connection between long-time announcer Matt Vasgersian and the new guys. Their lines seemed to exist in a vacuum. But the more I\u2019ve played, the more I noticed conversational exchanges between the three. Vasgersian still dominates as the play-by-play guy, but both Plesac and Reynolds offer timely and accurate information. There seems to be a new focus on explaining batters\u2019 past performance against each pitcher, which is neat. Unfortunately, repetitive lines of dialogue continue to creep in. In fact, during one game Harold Reynolds described both starting pitchers by using the same exact lines. With a limited amount recorded content, repetition is something that will likely be more noticeable the more I play. Still, this is probably the best team of broadcasters The Show has had, thanks to their fresh and interesting dialogue. The three-man crew ably brings the feel of real TV baseball onto the PS4. Mode Trip The three main modes of play return: Road to the Show, Franchise, and Diamond Dynasty. Added to the mix is the new Retro Mode, an attempt to replicate old 16-bit baseball games like Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball. While I loved those old games, this mode falls flat for me. For one thing, splash screens, text, sound effects, and music are delivered with old-school charm, while the players and animations are still current gen. And as good as the current gameplay is, it doesn\u2019t quite fit in with the loose arcade setting of the past. I get that the mode is likely designed for local multiplayer sessions with your buddies, but I can\u2019t see any other reason to revisit it. Road to the Show contains one of my favorite new additions so far: the entire career mode is now framed as a baseball documentary. An off-screen narrator describes the important locker room decisions players will have to make. For instance, my AA catcher, who honestly wasn\u2019t that good at catching, was asked to move to the outfield. I agreed; the team was stacked with catchers and lacking power hitting outfielders. I could have complained about or refused the move, and my story would have played out differently--with me likely riding the pine or being shipped to another city. It\u2019s fun shaping the player\u2019s personality as well as his skills. All of this is presented as though I was the focus of an \u201c30 for 30\u201d style show. In all, I found the entire documentary idea novel and interesting. Franchise mode is relatively similar to last year, but the \u201cCritical Situations\u201d feature is the new star. While simming, if something big is about to happen, the game will pause and allow you to take control. Thus far, I\u2019ve been given chances to walk off a game in extra innings, close out a tight contest, finish a complete game, and try to complete a batter\u2019s cycle. This feature should allow users to get through more seasons without missing the big moments. As for Diamond Dynasty, the core components of this card-based mode remain intact. The goals and reward system have been tweaked, with more ways to earn XP and currency throughout the game. Franchise mode itself is given a whole \u201cladder\u201d of ways to earn points and cards for use in Diamond Dynasty. In fact, for a new user the number of options might be a bit overwhelming. I\u2019m intrigued by the promise of timed events with specific entry requirements. Hopefully, these events will give life to the variety of cards that typically never make it into my starting lineup. On the other hand, I\u2019m disappointed that the Conquest game within Diamond Dynasty is unchanged. This odd mix of Risk and baseball was fun last year, but felt like it needed one or two more twists to keep it interesting; I don\u2019t see myself reinvesting a lot of time recapturing the USA, especially since my team has been effectively reset. Finally, while my online experiences have been limited thus far, they haven\u2019t been flawless. I had some noticeable lag between swing and contact, and in one instance my fielder kept glitching out while waiting for a fly ball. Neither issue affected the game as a whole, and the rest of my online matches have been fine."

        "Title": "Horizon Zero Dawn Review",
        "Score": 9.3,
        "id": "51bf3496d9c28a5d29f014088f60bf4b",
        "Content": "There\u2019s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I\u2019d finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later. Horizon\u2019s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. \u201c A sense of urgency is established from the get-go, as Horizon\u2019s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. The questions raised by protagonist Aloy and the primitive, feral machine-infested open world she inhabits kept me guessing throughout: what\u2019s at the centre of it all? Although Horizon suffers from occasionally corny dialogue that belies its smarts, the broader ideas it prods at - the nature of creation, for example - are remarkably ambitious. Aloy\u2019s personality helped me care about her journey on a more personal level. Nimbly voiced by Ashly Burch (known for her performance as Borderlands 2\u2019s Tiny Tina), she\u2019s a charming character to watch and play as because of the wry wit that tempers her big-hearted heroism; some of my favourite smaller moments came from Aloy\u2019s sarcastic interactions with other characters who didn\u2019t get the joke. Though you have some say on the way she responds to situations in the interests of dialogue flavour, she remains largely a well-intentioned character, which is in step with Horizon\u2019s broader story. Fighting Machines  There\u2019s much more flexibility to be found once Aloy\u2019s out in the big wide world. Horizon\u2019s combat is its most compelling feature, thanks to the variety found within 26 distinct species of animal-like machines that roam its great far-future expanse. These beasts have several weak points that can be scanned using Aloy\u2019s Focus (a lore-friendly device that gives you Witcher-like heightened senses), and hitting different points can have different results that change the way a fight plays out. Horizon's combat is its most compelling feature. \u201c  Send a piercing arrow into the bulging \u2018cargo sac\u2019 of a giant fire-spewing Bellowback, for example, and you'll set off a massive explosion. Down a flying, ice-shooting Glinthawk by destroying the armoured sac on its chest to temporarily freeze the bird, or shoot the cannon off the back of a tiger-like Ravager and pick it up to blast a T-Rex-esque Thunderjaw, who you only just noticed approaching from the corner of your eye during the fight. It\u2019s breathless stuff, and there are no hand-holding tutorials telling you how to best approach the beasts, which makes for more rewarding wins. After I learned how to fight competently, Horizon continually made me feel like a ridiculously accomplished warrior without sacrificing the vital sense that every major battle could easily result in my death, in large part thanks to the ferocity of the machines themselves. Though they patrol on set routes, even the 'herbivores' will immediately attack when you\u2019re spotted, and will continue to scan for you if you manage to find a hiding place. On the offense, these robotic beasts are authentically animalistic. Snapmaws \u2013 enormous, mechanical alligators \u2013 will swipe with their tails and spew ice blasts from their mouths, while tiger-like Ravagers will charge at you with alarming speed for a full body slam up close. Dodging their attacks requires constant use of Aloy\u2019s roll move, all the while using the quick on-the-fly crafting system to build ammo specifically to counter the threat. Her upgradable bows feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time. \u201c For Aloy\u2019s part, her arsenal is largely tricked-out \u2018primitive\u2019 weaponry. Her upgradable bows and elemental-infused arrows - your primary weapon - feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time, allowing for dead-eye aiming. She also has access to a handful of more elaborate devices like the Ropecaster, which shoots out ropes to immobilize enemies, or the Tripcaster, a weapon that creates explosive tripwire traps at a range. Though these more creative weapons sound great in theory, in practice they\u2019re annoyingly slow and fiddly when you're up against multiple threats, and I found the most challenging machines were too fast and too powerful to use them in a genuinely effective way. Fun to play around with on weaker enemies during more casual hunts, then, but far from crucial when you're up against a wall. Not that Horizon encourages you just to blindly wander into every fight and start shooting. A lot of the machines roam in packs, with larger beasts flanked by velociraptor-like sentry bots called Watchers, so if you\u2019re not careful you can be outnumbered and devoured within seconds. To counter this, there\u2019s generally a silent path to take: hiding in swatches of tall red grass and drawing machines in gives you a chance for a stealth kill, and if by some misfortune you\u2019re spotted, Aloy\u2019s Concentration skill is vital in helping you land an arrow right in that Watcher\u2019s prying eye before you make a quick escape. It\u2019s a shame luring specific machines away from their packs is so time-consuming, though; often simple hunts for a single animal evolve into massive fights against several types. Alternatively, Aloy doesn\u2019t have to do all the work herself, as she\u2019ll discover how to override the machines\u2019 brains in the field while exploring her world (to tell you how would ruin a wonderful surprise). Overriding has different effects depending on the machine - some become docile mounts, for example, while others will fight on your behalf, killing their own kind. As you upgrade your skill tree, these overrides can last for longer, which allows you to essentially build up a small army of loyal, vicious steeds. Watching them wreak havoc on the field from a place of safety is smugly satisfying. The Big, Big Wide World You don\u2019t just fight machines in Horizon. While not as engaging as their mechanical counterparts, there are human targets too - many of whom populate the bandit camps peppered throughout this massive open world. Though you\u2019re free to take them on as you please, I found it\u2019s best to take a stealthy approach through the tall grass and pick off these heavily armed NPCs one by one. That\u2019s a largely satisfying approach, aside from the fact that, like in other half-stealth games like Uncharted 4 or Watch Dogs 2, you can\u2019t hide bodies. It\u2019s a design decision that sticks in my craw when an NPC\u2019s curiosity piques after he or she spots someone sprawled on the ground with an arrow sticking out of its chest from a mile away. Clearing these enemy camps is one of the many incidental side activities scattered across Horizon, a variety which also includes digging in ancient bunkers for clues from the past, tracking machines through dedicated hunting grounds, and climbing to the top of a giant brontosaurus-like Tallneck to unlock more of the map. It\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t seen before in other games of this ilk - the Tallneck is basically a walking Far Cry tower - but thanks to the promise of XP and loot that you can trade for currency to buy better weapons, it\u2019s all very compulsive. Horizon's \u2018post-post apocalyptic\u2019 landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying. \u201c On top of that, Horizon's \u2018post-post apocalyptic\u2019 landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying, so journeying through it in search of things to do between main quests - not that you ever have to go too far - is usually a reward of its own. Snowy vistas, autumnal forests, and vast deserts are stunningly realised, even capped at 30 frames per second as it is. (That\u2019s true on PlayStation 4 Pro as well, where it runs in a stunning 4K mode.) Frozen mountain peaks or the calcified remains of a skyscraper make for eerie, quiet jaunts, made more unnerving by the Lost World-esque horror that sits in Horizon's underbelly. One of the most thrilling moments in my playthrough was when I got lost early on, skirted too close to the water\u2019s edge, and accidentally walked across the giant tail of a half-submerged Snapmaw before sprinting to safety with sweaty palms. Being killed in Horizon isn\u2019t Dark Souls-style punishing, but as you save via spread out \u2018campfires\u2019, the threat of death also equals the threat of losing some progress. It\u2019s enough to make these moments of terrifying discovery into Horizon\u2019s \u2018water cooler moments\u2019 \u2013 the ones you look back on and shiver. Aloy moves about the world with near Uncharted-like ease, too. Developer Guerrilla have done a great job at making her base movements - such as climbing, rolling, rappelling down cliff faces - fluid and responsive. Though I noticed the occasional pop-in and judder, Horizon\u2019s visuals keep up with Aloy, and impressively, I didn\u2019t notice any significant glitches in its massive open world. 21 Stunning Horizon Zero Dawn Screenshots 21 Images The Human Element Elsewhere, settlements and camps form a rag-tag civilization. Humans of this world have been reduced back to a tribal state, and each tribe has its own identity shaped by historical victories and grievances and various theories on the nature of their strange existence, devoid of a sense of their true history. Guerrilla has done an enormous amount of seductive world-building here, and I spent a great deal of time just wandering around settlements listening to elders tell elaborate tales of gods to children or seeking stories of misplaced vengeance in the crowds. Main missions cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world. \u201c It\u2019s at these settlements that you\u2019ll be given your missions, both the urgent, high-stakes main quests and the side-quests that pop up as little exclamation marks on you map. While the latter are as lengthy as the main missions, they do  quickly fall into regular fetch-quest patterns: go and find this thing, kill some things, return, collect reward. Though these make for a great excuse to destroy more machines and there is the occasional compelling storyline, I would have liked a little more originality to keep them from blurring together into one, and better rewards for completion in the late game, where XP ceases to matter next to the search for frustratingly scarce useful weapon mods. Main missions, on the other hand, cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world. I found myself switching between chasing the ghosts of the past in the deep, lonely bunkers of lost technology and solving the murder of a tribal leader, using my focus ability to track bloodstains and trace clues before facing off against a tribe of cultists in a climactic battle. Horizon encourages you to chase your own story, but help others a little on the way too. Its ultimate reveal - prior to a frenzied, heart-in-the-throat finale - is smart and provocative, and a great pay off to the journey."

Regardless of how you feel about its products or its branding, you have to respect its commitment to the PC as a gaming platform. It got its start way back in the day with the OG Boomslang mouse and now has a lineup of scary-sounding peripherals, and this time around I'm testing its Deathadder Chroma USB gaming mouse. It's the company's entry-level RGB mouse featuring a comfortable design and a simple button layout for $70 MSRP ($49.99 on Amazon for now)  (\u00a362.99 on Amazon UK) .   Ergonomics  The first time I wrapped my hand around Deathadder Chroma I was in love. It's an absolute joy to hold and use. The rubberized textures on the right and left side of the mouse kept it from slipping out of my hand, but also felt comfortable on my thumb and fingers. Other mice I've used generate some discomfort after extended use, but my initial impression was that the Deathadder Chroma is easily the most comfortable mouse I've ever used.

Asus ROG Keris II Ace Michael Higham  Though it lacks the ability to fine-tune the weight of the mouse like the Logitech G502 ($51.99 on Amazon) , Razer did an excellent job on its design by giving it the perfect weight so that it has just enough heft without feeling cumbersome. The right and left mouse buttons are contoured to allow my fingers rest on them in a way that feels natural. It's almost like the default resting position of my hand was scanned and a mouse built around it. There's no fighting with the mouse or awkward finger or button placement.   Also, if you're a lefty, Razer hasn't forgotten you. It sells a Deathadder Chroma for southpaws named the Left-Hand Edition, and it's exactly the same as this one except the buttons are reversed. Since the large majority of gaming mice are made for right-handers, it's nice to see an option for the 10-percent of people whose left hands are dominant.  Customization  For the most part, the Deathadder Chroma is no-frills mouse that doesn't offer much in the way of tweaking it to your liking. There are only five buttons total, including the mouse wheel, which is pretty much the minimum number of buttons we expect on a mouse. All but the left-click button can be programmed using the Synapse software, so if you're a power user who requires customization for macros or even DPI sensitivity switching, the Deathadder Chroma isn't for you. I like its simple design though, because I could just game without worrying about what button does what, or accidentally touching something inadvertently and dying.  Lighting is also pretty low-key, as only the Razer logo and the mouse wheel are illuminated. Razer lets you change the style and color of the Razer logo and the mouse wheel independently of one another, which is appreciated. However, none of the lighting schemes are particularly exciting. The colors are limited to two options on the scroll wheel: static, or spectrum cycling. On the logo, there's an additional option for \"breathing.\" Chroma-enabled apps can control the lighting on the device, but with your hand on the mouse and eyes on the screen, you never really see the lights anyway. Since its an RGB mouse you can choose from 16.9 million colors, but I personally think it's weird to use a Razer product and not have it glowing bright green.   Software  The Deathadder uses Razer's Synapse software, and if you've used a Razer product before you probably already have it installed on your computer. It's used for all of the company's products, so if you already have a Razer keyboard or headset you don't need to reinstall anything. As soon as I connected the Deathadder the software detected the mouse and went about making sure both the software and firmware were updated. It's a nice touch since most people would never think about updating the firmware on their mouse or keyboard.  After it's updated, the Razer Synapse software lets you customize the buttons, adjust the lighting scheme, tweak the sensitivity of the optical sensor, adjust the polling rate, and calibrate the mouse to whatever surface you're using. The calibration software has presets for several of Razer's mousepads, but you can run a quick calibration test to make the mouse work best with whatever surface you're using.   One interesting option that is offered is the ability to adjust how far you can lift the mouse off the surface before it detects it as movement. Personally, I was unable to tell any meaningful difference between the lowest and highest settings, but your mileage may vary.  Gaming  After a few hours of using the Deathadder Chroma, I found myself thinking I could easily make it my mouse of choice for both gaming and everyday applications. It fit comfortably in my hand, and I liked that there are no extraneous buttons or weird angles to get in the way. There's not a whole lot to the Deathadder Chroma other than the usual right and left mouse buttons, a clickable mouse wheel, and a pair of forward and back buttons near the thumb rest, but that's what I like about it. It's simple, and easy to use. Even after hours of gaming with the Deathadder Chroma my hand never felt fatigued, which was the opposite experience I had with the similarly-priced Logitech G502. It's simple, precise, and was always comfortable.

For the first time in my admittedly short CS:GO career I got MVP during a casual session of bomb defusal. Having switched through two other gaming mice during my time with the Deathadder, I don't think the results are just from the power of suggestion. The comfortable, perfectly weighted Deathadder really did help my game. It lacks some of the fine-tuning features available on other gaming mice. For example, the SteelSeries Gaming Engine allows adjustments for acceleration and deceleration, not found in the Synapse software for the Deathadder. Still, for an honest and easy plug-and-play experience, the Deathadder is hard to beat.  Purchasing Guide  Although the Razer DeathAdder Chroma technically carries a suggested price of $70, it's often available at a healthy discount. For now you can grab it for $49.99 on Amazon or around that price at other big box retailers. Durinf extreme sales events like Black Friday, the DeathAdder Chroma can drop to as low as $35.

        "id": "80925deee0c96ab8fd77da569f9b7de3",
        "Content": "UPDATE: Fire Emblem Fates is out in the UK this week, so we thought you'd like to catch up on some of the Fates stuff you might have missed during the US and Japan launches.  I realized how amazing Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is during a particularly nerve-wracking moment: My samurai had been cut off from the rest of my war party and was alone, with half health, against a much stronger enemy paladin. With permadeath turned on, there was a very good chance I could lose him forever. Things looked bad, but I couldn\u2019t give up. Holding my breath, I first moved my swordsman to a square of terrain that gave him extra speed and health, equipped a duel katana that would nullify the knight\u2019s more powerful spear, and sprang into action. It was a gamble, but I was betting on my samurai\u2019s Vantage skill, an ability that allows him to strike the enemy first, even when attacked. My bet paid off: the paladin fell in one swift stroke, and my samurai lived to fight another day. It\u2019s these jump-for-joy, shake-with-relief moments that make Birthright such a fantastic experience, and its more welcoming difficulty (relative to its also-excellent, veteran-focused counterpart, Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest \u2013 reviewed here ) makes it a great entry point for the series. It\u2019s a clever turn-based tactical RPG that constantly rewards you for smart decisions, and every move, every piece of equipment, and every relationship you foster serves a purpose. Combine that with robust customization and a gut-wrenching story, and you have something that achieves greatness. Family Ties Birthright\u2019s heart-rending, 30-hour story takes place in the peaceful nation of Hoshido, which looks like something straight out of ancient Japan thanks to its beautiful, blossom-swept pagodas and lush bamboo forests. There, the army is desperately trying to hold back the advancement of the neighboring kingdom of Nohr, whose blood-thirsty king Garon will not stop until his enemies are crushed under his boot. As a prince or princess of Nohr, you\u2019re forced to take up arms against your own family in order to win peace and stop your father\u2019s evil ambitions. I often teared up as sibling accused each other of treason \u201c It\u2019s an emotional and engaging journey, one where I often teared up as siblings accused each other of treason and challenged one another to mortal combat. This sad tale is elevated by excellent art direction that uses sweeping angles and well-timed close-ups on characters\u2019 expressive faces to convey pain, regret, or hope as the two warring factions fight for supremacy. The graphics are an improvement over Fire Emblem: Awakening, especially notable in the way characters and buildings look more detailed, and your heroes actually have proper feet instead of weird stubs. In the background, the musical score does heavy lifting with hard-hitting percussions and soaring brass instruments to capture the martial spirit of Nohr, while haunting wind instruments and delicately plucked strings echo the tranquility of Hoshido. Even when I wasn\u2019t playing, I kept my game on just so I could enjoy the music. 65 Images Fight for Your (Birth)Right The story, music, and visuals are great, but the battle over Hoshido is even better. Combat in Fire Emblem can get pretty difficult so it\u2019s great that Birthright is so accessible to beginners by default. A sliding difficulty setting means you can ease into the experience by turning on Phoenix Mode in Normal setting, which will revive fallen units on the battlefield at the start of each phase. Or, if you want to dive right into the fire, you can turn on permadeath in Lunatic Mode, where every decision on the battlefield counts and just one wrong move can wipe out your entire party forever. Hard Mode is a variation of both, with the choice of turning permadeath on or off, which I prefer because it lets you adjust the difficulty setting precisely to fit your comfort level. Turn what once was safe, benign space into harmful terrain \u201c It's a good idea to start on a lower difficulty level, because there\u2019s a lot going on on these tactical maps  For instance, there\u2019s a clever new feature called Dragon Veins that can help you get a leg up in combat: when a member of a royal house stands on one of these special map tiles, they can turn what was once a safe, benign space on the battlefield into harmful terrain, like a spikey bamboo trap that depletes enemy health. Royals can also create a wellspring of health that will cure party members standing directly under the healing tiles. Additionally, helpful villagers living in houses dotting the map will offer you useful items when you visit them. Both are locations where you\u2019ll have to make smart moves in order to control before the enemy does. Birthright also reintroduces the awesome Pair Up and Dual Systems from Awakening, now under the names Attack Stance and Guard Stance. This clever mechanic lets you pair up allies on the battlefield to temporarily buff their stats, dual-attack the enemy, or parry their offense. This is extra important because, as with all Fire Emblem games, as allies fight side by side, their support rank goes up and their assists improve whenever they\u2019re near each other. Since different classes offer different types of support, it\u2019s fun to mix and match pairs to get the most effective results:  I liked to keep Sakura, my lower-level healer, near Scarlet, my stronger Wyvern Lord, so the former could benefit from the latter\u2019s Rally Defense skill, which generates four points of extra defense. That doesn\u2019t mean combat is a walk in the park, however. Like in previous Fire Emblems, you have to juggle a number of combat variables, including learning to defeat the type of weapons enemies use with its rock-paper-scissors style counter, observing what their stats and buffs are, making note of whether they\u2019re paired up (a new feature that lets enemies attack and defend just as effectively as allied troops) and taking into account how close they are. Wisely, Birthright makes it easy to manage all of this with an intuitive interface on the lower screen. Take the series\u2019 Weapon Triangle for example: swords and tomes beat arrows and clubs, clubs and arrows trump spears and hidden weapons, spears and hidden weapons beat swords and magic. That might seem a bit confusing to the uninitiated, but a handy color-coded schematic makes it easy to understand. Meanwhile the Combat Forecast lets you view enemy and ally stats side by side, with buffs and debuffs clearly marked blue and red respectively. (Any stats that are maxed out are shown in green.) It\u2019s a simple system that makes determining the outcome of a fight hassle-free.  If there\u2019s one thing that disappoints me about Birthright, it\u2019s the lack of diverse mission objectives. While the maps have a nice variation of frosty villages, slippery ship decks and  poisonous bogs, your goal almost always comes down to one of two things: route the enemy or defeat the boss. There were only a couple of missions where I had to do something unique, such as escape or conquer an enemy fort, which makes it difficult to recommend this version of Fates to veteran fans yearning for a campaign that\u2019ll show them something new. Birthright might be aimed at newcomers, but there\u2019s no reason not to throw a curveball every once in awhile just to spice things up a bit. The Ties That Bind One of my favorite features in Fire Emblem is the Support system, and I\u2019m happy to report it\u2019s just as much of a highlight as ever. Not only does teaming up allies make them more effective in combat, but it unlocks engaging story vignettes off the battlefield. I laughed out loud during my conversations with the grumpy ninja Saizo, and smiled as I talked with the always-sunny fox-man Kaden. Each character feels like a real person with unique personality quirks and a distinctive look. It\u2019s easy to fall in love with them \u2013 which you can actually do. Pairing up constantly and attaining an S rank (the highest available) with a character of the opposite gender not only unlocks deliciously sugary romantic dialogue, but will result in having children who will inherit their parents skills and abilities, adding another useful member to your team. By the end, my archer was sniping distant enemies in a single shot \u201c Speaking of which, jobs, classes, and character modification are another strong point. New troop types like fast-moving ninjas and hard-hitting Oni Savages are basically just tweaked versions of previous Fire Emblem classes, but being able to modify occupations along with their associated weapons is where the robust customization really shines. Special seals let you level up a unit\u2019s base class and gain extra perks and abilities, or change their class to something better suited to your style. It\u2019s a feature worth experimenting with: I used a Heart Seal on my villager Mozu to change an underpowered spear-wielder into a fearless archer. I also powered up her bow by using special ore harvested in my hub fortress. By the end of the campaign, Mozu was sniping distant enemies in a single shot, making her one of my favorite soldiers. It\u2019s this type of modification that makes building an army fun and rewarding. Adding to your army and improving your ranks is important, because even when you start on the low difficulty, there\u2019s a pretty steep difficulty curve to overcome by the end of the lengthy story campaign. Unlike Conquest however, Birthright lets you off the hook if you find yourself underleveled and up against a seemingly insurmountable foe: you can return to previously visited areas of the map so you can repeat some battles (against randomized opponents) to toughen up your troops, increase your Support ranks, and experiment with different strategies. Duel Personalities Off the battlefield, Fire Emblem Fates offers a base-building mode called My Castle, and for the most part it\u2019s a pretty decent addition to the flow of Fire Emblem\u2019s traditional gameplay. I liked designing the layout of my fortress and filling it with useful architecture that reflects the beauty and aesthetic of ancient Japanese temples and castles. It\u2019s not purely cosmetic, though, because each building feels purposeful: a lottery shop gives you access to one free item a day (you might get a Duel Yumi bow one day or a handful of beans the next) while inside the battle arena your troops will spar to win you precious items like pearls and jade that can be used in a smithy to strengthen weapons. One of my favorite buildings is the Mess Hall, where a daily rotation of troops will whip up delicious, stat-boosting meals like crips simmered beans that will raise strength and resistance in the next battle. (There\u2019s no way of knowing what buffs you\u2019ll receive or which of your troops will receive them until you do some experimentation however, but that\u2019s what\u2019s so fun about it.) Some places are built for comedy: things got pretty silly when my heroine walked into the hot spring while the boys were using it. That might not seem useful, but taking a dip in hot water can lead to more character interactions. Buildings also double as additional defense against online players during multiplayer. Online battles are pretty fun: you can pit five of your best troops against five of you friends\u2019 best troops, locally or online, to see who gets bragging rights. Buildable artillery units, like turrets and ballistas, are a nice way to stop invading Street Passers in their tracks. There's no real way to add personal flair to your castle to make it truly unique \u201c One minor annoyance, though, was the clunky interface in the online portion. A crystal ball near the throne area of your fortress organizes your multiplayer options into neat little menu tabs, but it\u2019s sometimes easy to accidentally log out entirely once you\u2019re finished flipping through them. There\u2019s also no real way to add personal flair to your castle to make it truly unique, outside of designing the layout. That said, you can dress your troops in cute little accessories like a pink beret or a dirty kerchief that will lessen damage while invading a castle, so that\u2019s cool. I also like that you can use StreetPass to summon someone else\u2019s troops into battle. That in itself is a nice incentive to hop online.

        "Content": "UPDATE: Fire Emblem Fates is out in the UK this week, so we thought you'd like to catch up on some of the Fates stuff you might have missed during the US and Japan launches.  Some of the most heart-pounding, high-stakes moments in Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest come from pivotal decisions in the heat of turn-based tactical combat, but it\u2019s the resulting consequences that kept me hooked for well over 40 hours. Whether I was watching my soldiers establish and grow their relationships as warriors, or watching in horror as another one permanently fell to an enemy blade, I loved every moment of it. The stiff challenge, tailored to Fire Emblem veterans, and visually striking colorful style is complemented by wonderful mission variety and some deep customization.   Conquest is the tougher half of the Fire Emblem Fates package - for the other, check out our review of Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright , which is sold and reviewed separately.  Conquest\u2019s tense decisionmaking on a grid-based battlefield is part of an intricate and addictive turn-based tactics loop. \u201c  Fire Emblem Fates\u2019 beautiful anime graphics and superb audio are on par with 2013\u2019s excellent Fire Emblem Awakening. The distinctly European flavor of the glory-seeking Nohr kingdom contrasts with the spiritual Japanese vibe of the peaceful Hoshido Clan for great looking, visually distinct battles and characters. The two feuding families kick off a tumultuous and gut-wrenching campaign full of tough battles. In Conquest, you play the role of Corrin, a young noble born to the Hoshidos but raised by the Nohr who chooses to fight for his adopted brothers and sisters to find an end to the conflict.  Conquest\u2019s tense decisionmaking on a grid-based battlefield is part of an intricate and addictive turn-based tactics loop. Attacks are based around chance-to-hit percentages and hidden dice rolls, with a simple rock-paper-scissors ruleset to keep melee weapons and projectile attacks balanced: Swords and magic beat axes and bows, which are beaten by lances and hidden weapons, which are in turn vulnerable to swords and magic. Each choice made on the battlefield plays a critical role in winning a skirmish, but your actions can also have a larger impact on how units develop. Decisions include choosing which soldiers to deploy, their weapons and loadout, and the right time to attack or run from enemies.   Experience from combat naturally rewards you with level-ups and increased stats but, as is a defining and beloved characteristic of Fire Emblem games, your soldiers also get stronger based on bonds and relationships that develop as they fight side by side. Additionally, building up relationships opens up new story content in the form of support conversations, which add personality quirks and depth to their character, often revealing more about their motivations or silly personal imperfections. Felicia, for instance, is a hardworking maid you meet early on who also happens to be a total clutz, while Xander is the conflicted but dutiful crown prince of Nohr who diligently fights for the kingdom despite not always agreeing with his father\u2019s decisions.  The personalities and stat bonuses add incredible depth to Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest\u2019s carefully balanced battle system. \u201c  The personalities and stat bonuses add incredible depth to Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest\u2019s carefully balanced battle system, because attack percentages and damage is affected by range, enemy class, and what allied characters are nearby. And while each class has a specific role in a fight, you can unlock additional perks as your classes evolve, with some surprising effects. For example, once Corrin has upgraded his class Nohr Prince to a Nohr Noble, his Draconic Hex spell can follow up standard attacks and add a bonus effect that significantly reduces an enemy\u2019s stats, softening them up for a killing blow. Or Silas\u2019 high-risk, high-reward Vow of Friendship power, which adds additional damage dealt and taken if he\u2019s near another main character who has 50% or less health. These complex abilities can really turn a fight in your favor when used wisely on the right soldier and in the right situation. Building strong relationships draw new, more powerful soldiers to join your ranks and the loop starts over as you develop those recruits.    Yet even with a perfect soldier pairing, a 95% attack chance is no guarantee. That works out to the same as rolling a 20-sided die and landing on one - it\u2019s not very likely, but definitely a possibility you have to account for. Sometimes bad luck can steal away the most carefully planned approaches, and part of the drama of this story is how you deal with those losses. The fear of a character\u2019s permanent death is what makes Fire Emblem\u2019s choices feel difficult and significant, because all of that progress and their associated relationships can be lost if you choose poorly. Note that you can disable permadeath if you want a low-pressure way to witness the great story between the feuding Hoshido and the Nohr kingdoms, but you\u2019d ultimately miss out since the fear of losing a valuable team member raises the stakes, turning mundane moment-to-moment choices into life-or-death decisions.  What\u2019s disappointing in a game about forming strong relationships is that the story isn\u2019t able to acknowledge the loss of teammates in a significant way. \u201c  What\u2019s disappointing in a game about forming strong relationships is that the story isn\u2019t able to acknowledge the loss of teammates in a significant way. Unless a specific death is part of the campaign\u2019s plot, the characters just go on with their lives and never mention the loss, even if they\u2019d been joined at the hip for many battles.  While the counterpart game, Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright, has the same great tactical mechanics, Conquest\u2019s tougher campaign uses an impressive amount of variety to force you to put these skills to their best use. It really ramps up a third of the way through, as missions throw curveball after curveball to constantly keep you off guard, with unique objectives that turn up the pressure on the battlefield. In one mission, you have to survive for 11 turns against huge waves of enemies; In another, you have to uncover the identity of a pirate thief hidden in the middle of a larger skirmish before he steals all your gold.  66 Images  This is a bonafide master-level quest edition that feels tuned to challenge veteran Fire Emblem players, which might make Birthright the better starting point for new players, but Conquest is the deeper, more elaborate of the two. One of the biggest distinctions is that Conquest gives you such limited opportunities to develop your troops before taking on a new, more challenging mission, since you can\u2019t grind and play additional side battles at will the way you would in Birthright. While that might sound intimidating, Conquest plays fair. Each map presents clear rules and allows lots of room for strategy. In one example, I could manipulate randomly appearing vortexes via switches to push enemy soldiers five units to the north or south. If I didn\u2019t, the wind would push my units at the end of the next turn. Many maps have a unique spin like this, which kept me thinking of new approaches instead of simply repeating the strategy that worked last time.  This is a bonafide master-level quest edition that feels tuned to challenge veteran Fire Emblem players. \u201c Conquest\u2019s only slight fumble comes from its new base-building mode called My Castle. In it, you build shops, monuments, and arenas that double as additional defenses if you\u2019re invaded by other players in StreetPass multiplayer. The shops themselves are useful, since you can unlock new gear and resources. However, since there are only a handful of themes to pick from, the buildings all end up looking and feeling the same. My Castle offers a few fun ideas that reward smart investment of resources with new weapon types and special buffs that damage enemy invaders, but it also suffers from a sluggish online interface. You have to navigate a lot of menus to find a list of town to visit, and you\u2019re immediately sent back to your own castle after the visit to redo the process all over again.
