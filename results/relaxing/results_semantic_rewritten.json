        "Content": "Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite Save the World, still exists, but it\u2019s not great . But as the battle royale genre started to gain popularity early in 2017, Epic adapted its survival game\u2019s basic systems into something new: Fortnite Battle Royale, a separate, free-to-play game that feels like the perfect home for Save the World\u2019s wayward mechanics.",
