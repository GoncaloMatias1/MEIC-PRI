        "Content": "The first of these, on the top of a huge crane, also introduces you to one of the more interesting, if a little frustrating, aspects of the experience: mini-games. Mastering your fear of heights by rolling 2-D marbles through a maze is one thing, but I think my favorite is the CPR mini-game that occurs later on, only because of its adorable icons. You block the lightening from entering an electrocuted mans heart, while allowing the blood drops to flow through.\n\nNot quite as welcome as some of the mini-games, are the timed tasks. One example is infamous enough to be known as the \"seatbelt dexterity puzzle\" in the forums. The set-up: You're trapped in a car and for some reason the oncoming train refuses to acknowledge your existence even if you wave or honk the horn.\n\nUse your brain in the exactly way the developers intend or perish! Granted, adventure games always require you to puzzle things out, and that is half the point, but when you're not granted the leisure to do so, frustration escalates rather quickly. There are actually zipped save files you can download in the forums to bypass it, for the weary who still want to complete the game.\n\n",

Or, it's a game about finding ribbons in an empty town. Just from that, you can get a good idea of whether or not you're likely to click with it, though it certainly won't hurt if you count \u201cexploration games\u201d like Gone Home and Dear Esther as fond, if melancholy jaunts.\n\nPuzzles do help nudge Ether One to the 'game' side of the ongoing, tedious 'what is a game' stakes. It has puzzles, ergo it is a game. Nice and easy.\n\n",

        "Content": "Rust is a griefer\u2019s paradise. There\u2019s nothing quite like finding a guy sleeping in a forest and looting him before he wakes up, or camping outside another player\u2019s fort and killing her when she opens the door. For those who enjoy deadly games of cat and mouse, Rust might just be the best survival game out there.\n\nBut anybody more interested in building and exploration, or isn\u2019t able to devote themselves to one game, may have a rough time. Even though other games are better at specific elements like crafting, combat, survival, and exploration, I\u2019ve never played a survival game that combines them quite like Rust. The way it blends survival and competitive genres is fun, especially if you enjoy the goofier bits, like firing rocket launchers at a naked man running from a pig, or being stabbed to death by a person blasting Russian music over their microphone and brandishing a spear.\n\nPlenty of survival games go for a grim, faded look, but Rust\u2019s colors pop. The sky is a vibrant blue that I could stare at for hours. The vegetation feels lush and inviting, like it would be fun to wander through the grass barefoot.\n\n\u201c All of that happens while contending with hostile players, which adds a constant element of danger. There can be over 400 people on a single server, and they\u2019re all potentially dangerous. Like the once-popular zombie survival game DayZ, it\u2019s best to approach other people with a distrustful eye.\n\n",

The first challenge the title provides is actually finding each game. The menus are very confusing for a collection aimed at casual gamers.\n\nSound and music can be turned on or off (but not turned down) and for some reason the developers decided to make game's credits unskippable, so be sure not to select that feature by accident. As for the games themselves, they're a mixed bag. Many, like checkers, Sudoku and Mastermind are worth playing in spite of their poor representation here, because they're pretty fun regardless of interpretation.\n\n",

For all the clever ways it keeps you engaged with Devotion\u2019s environmental storytelling, emotional flashbacks, and powerful anecdotes, the actual mechanical act of playing is relatively unimpressive and boring. You basically just walk into a room, inspect anything that has a dot on it in your UI, and move on.\n\n[Note: As of the time of this writing, Devotion is no longer listed on Steam . Developer Red Candle Games is attempting to restore it but does not know if or when it will return.] Some horror games offer little more than cheap jump-scares and buckets of gore, but Devotion is the kind of psychological horror with the potential to keep you thinking for weeks after you've beaten it. It's expertly-paced and doesn\u2019t stick around long enough for its mechanical simplicity to overstay its welcome, but in that three hours delivers a powerfully unsettling story.\n\n",
