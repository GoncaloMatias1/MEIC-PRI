Players on each team alternate batters while at the plate and rotate between pitching and fielding each inning, and being able to focus single-mindedly on one defensive task is liberating. While one person plays cat and mouse with pitch selection, the other can focus on where to go for force outs and make strategic choices around the diamond.\n\nIn its current iteration, co-op feels more like a fun proof-of-concept rather than a fully fleshed-out mode fit for online competition. The stability I\u2019ve come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit. \u201c Co-op games frequently failed to connect me with cross-platform friends when we tried to play together as well, and all sorts of technical issues were unfortunately common in my time with The Show 22.\n\n",
