There\u2019s also an option to play in first-person mode for the Space Marines, in which you use WASD or the control stick to move one square at a time. It really allows you to become immersed in the spooky, foreboding setting of the space hulk, but is generally pretty terrible from a gameplay standpoint.\n\nI\u2019d much prefer to be using a mouse and keyboard in this type of game, but it seems really apparent Space Hulk: Tactics was designed for a gamepad and had some sub-par mouse controls slapped on after the fact. I had to choose between trying to play it like a PC strategy game and having my clicks often not register or trigger something unintended, or pick up my Xbox controller and deal with the hassle of, for instance, having to use the buttons to manually cycle through all of my units instead of simply clicking to select them.\n\n",

But when a game like this one comes along, in no way catering to new players, I'm afraid most won't have the patience to get past the too-steep learning curve.\n\nFor the first three Commodore 64 titles to come to the American Virtual Console, play control was an issue -- but not a dealbreaker. The clumsy tire-swapping mechanic in Pitstop II , the unintuitive martial arts maneuvers in International Karate and the stiff, frustrating jumping commands of The Last Ninja all merited negative mention in the reviews of each of those three C64 games in their VC debuts, but ultimately other positives outweighed those drawbacks in all three cases. I'm not sure that's the case again this time.\n\n",
