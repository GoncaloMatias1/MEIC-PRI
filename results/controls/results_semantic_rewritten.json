Confirming your choices requires that you hold a floaty, twitchy cursor over what you want, push in towards the screen, and then pull back, all without accidentally leaving the boundaries of what you're trying to press, because if you do, that resets the whole process. It's a borderline-broken system that left me with little choice but to keep a controller nearby at all times.",

It's one of the worst control choices I've had to endure for any Wii game, not only because your movements actually have noticeable lag before they are translated on-screen, but because you battle so many enemies throughout any given level that you arm is sure to be sore by the time you're done. You encounter the occasional boss in fights that are supposed to be epic, but the ensuing battles are over in seconds -- all you have to do is shake continuously and you'll lay waste to your enemies before they are done with their opening dialogs.",
