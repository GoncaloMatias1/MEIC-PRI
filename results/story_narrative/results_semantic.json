        "Title": "Undertale Review",
        "Content": "My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That\u2019s kind of Undertale\u2019s specialty \u2014 playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.\n\nEverything I did mattered. That clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn\u2019t have been told in any other way or medium. Undertale has to be a game, and that\u2019s the key to its brilliance.\n\nIn a violent playthrough, I had to grind quite a bit to meet certain story requirements and grew tired of it after a while. Fighting enemy after enemy replaced the puzzles in the peaceful runs, however, and the tradeoff felt very balanced and ultimately meaningful to the story. I also found myself trudging back through areas I had already cleared just so I could beat a boss or get an item, and while it was absolutely worth it in the end, I wasn't terribly excited to do it.\n\nIts dodging-based combat minigames especially rely on that concept. Boss battles consistently subverted my expectations, even after I thought I\u2019d figured everything out, but even run-of-the-mill random encounters are closely intertwined with storytelling and worldbuilding. Every enemy has a unique personality expressed both through combat and non-combative options.\n\nEvery one of them feels deliberate \u2014 long sections of dialogue at the beginning and certain fights can be slow, but they are necessary for establishing the characters in a way that only games can do. In a different run, underwhelming boss battles turn mournful because of what one-hit KOs imply in the world. It was Undertale's ongoing, well-woven theme of determination that kept me playing and replaying.\n\nSmall, semi-hidden notes and dialogue enrich the world and build on an already compelling story of humanity and morality. A favorite was a series of \u201cecho flowers\u201d in a beautiful, ethereal hallway that repeated snippets of an overhead conversation. A monster didn\u2019t want to share her greatest wish \u2014 that one day she would climb the mountain that traps all the monsters underground and look out at the world \u2014 for fear of being laughed at, and although her friend promised they wouldn\u2019t, the friend ended up laughing anyway.\n\n",

        "Content": "Sure, your controller is down, but they\u2019re a fun and refreshing way to break up the large swaths of QTE\u2019s and dialogue trees. What is your favorite Telltale adventure game? Tales from the Borderlands The Wolf Among Us The Walking Dead Tales of Monkey Island Batman Back to the Future Other Answer See Results New Tales tries to give your hands more to do by occasionally letting you wander around a scene, examining objects and opening crates for cash that you\u2019ll never be able to spend all of on the cache of cosmetic character skins, or participate in minigames such as hacking or the Vaultlander action-figure fights.\n\nThe fact that New Tales from the Borderlands exists at all warms my heart, considering that it had to defy the death of Telltale Games to do so. The original 2014 episodic adventure grabbed me with its excellent writing, sharp sense of humor, and likable main characters in Fiona and Rhys. While the unconnected, full-game-in-one-box follow-up gets a lot of things right, its attempts to flesh out the Telltale formula \u2013 not to mention the runtime \u2013 bog down what is otherwise a funny romp on a new planet with a new cast of anti-heroes.\n\nWhat I like most about New Tales from the Borderlands are its three new protagonists: the prudish, know-it-all scientist Anu; her street-smart, fame-chasing adopted brother Octavio; and the rageaholic frozen yogurt shop owner Fran. L0u13 (\u201cLouie\u201d), a killbot who starts to question the purpose of his one-note existence and gets a lot of laughs by the time the end credits roll, is also along for the ride in a non-playable role. New Tales was handled by Borderlands developer Gearbox itself in the wake of Telltale\u2019s demise, but the quality of its characters and their humor is fairly consistent.\n\n",

Xillia is the thirteenth primary Tales game, so even with the choice of a main character, there\u2019s a lot that series veterans will find familiar and welcome. New systems and approaches are combined with tried-and-true, traditional Tales staples to create a product that complements an already-extensive catalog of PlayStation 3 RPGs.\n\nTales of Xillia is in no way, shape, or form the best Tales game to date, but it\u2019s likely to appeal to both franchise loyalists and newcomers alike, even if the latter group might have a bit of a hard time wrapping their heads around some of Xillia\u2019s complexities. Apart from beautiful, sparsely used anime-style cutscenes, Tales of Xillia presents itself almost entirely in-engine. This keeps things moving along quickly, since load times are extremely brisk, but also makes it look a tad bit dated.\n\n",

But when you get into the nitty-gritty of how the game plays and how you explore the story, you'll realize that there's a lot more to this game than just plot. There's difficult puzzle gameplay, plenty of conversation to partake in, choices to make, and even a morality system to keep an eye on that gives the game inherent replay value.\n\n",

I\u2019ve spent a fair bit of time scrolling through this sizable library of short descriptions, and though much of it is well-written, it\u2019s a pretty poor substitute for in-game storytelling that I worry won\u2019t come often enough to keep me invested.\n\n",
