That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.",

For instance, one look at the controller was all it took for Ubisoft to dive into Red Steel, a game that may not have hit all the marks, but definitely has the right idea as to how the controller should enable the user to interact with games like never before by staging motion-controlled swordfights and the manipulation of in-level objects with the shake of the nunchuk. The Wii Sports compilation is another solid example, as simple motions such as swinging a racket or bat, or rolling a bowling ball down a virtual lane is instantly immersive and seems tailor-fit for the system.",
