        "Content": "It’s funny to think about now, but there was a time when fans had a wide variety of baseball games to choose from. If you didn’t want a complex simulation of the real thing like MLB The Show, you could find baseball games featuring robots, little kids, or even living bobbleheads. Most of those have gone the way of the dodo now, but Super Mega Baseball 3 throws it back, not only by offering a less serious option but by recapturing some old favorite retro-style pick-up-and-play gameplay and features. Despite the double-superlative name, this isn’t an “extreme” arcade sports game in the vein of the cartoony NFL Blitz or NBA Jam. There are no over-the-top power-ups or zany circus catches. Instead, the Super Mega Baseball series features accessible and grounded gameplay, with hits that come off the bat in authentic ways and fielders who play to their abilities based on their stats. Batters produce a satisfying variety of bloop singles, sinking line drives, and lazy popups, all dependent on the location of the pitch and timing of the swing. Defensively, diving fielders more often than not knock the balls down rather than come up with miracle snags. While the player’s appearances border on the surreal, the baseball is certainly real enough. Super Mega Baseball 3 continues the tradition of realistic and refined baseball gameplay that's more simulation than arcade, yet with simple controls that even younger players can grasp. 17 Images Everything I liked about Super Mega Baseball 2’s gameplay returns in Super Mega Baseball 3, including the ultra-customizable difficulty system and performance-based player confidence. The ability to use power swings and pitches is back with some nice tweaks to increase the risks and rewards of proper timing. During games, the option exists to expertly time a pitch or swing, potentially adding the little extra oomph needed for a home run or strikeout. However, overthrow a power pitch and expect that ball to not go where you want it to. With a power swing, your odds of hitting a home run go up… but your ability to simply make contact goes down. In the past, using the power options during crucial situations created some memorable moments; the increased risk/rewards only serves to sweetly ramp up the tension. I also like that AI batters seem less robotic and more likely to swing at pitches outside of the zone. I was able to generate more strikeouts than in the past by throwing junk in and off the plate. Super Mega Baseball 3 also takes its best swing at filling in some key baseball elements that were missing in SMB2, and the result is a more realistic baseball experience. In particular, the battle between baserunners and catchers has been intensified. In the past, when you wanted to steal a base you’d give the command and watched as the runner waited until the pitch was thrown. Guessing when to steal – optimally during anticipated off-speed pitches – was the only true decision for the offensive player. On the other side, there was little an opposing pitcher could do other than hope the catcher had time to make a throw. Whether the runner was safe or out was largely dependent on luck. I love the way it puts focus on an often-underappreciated aspect of the real sport. “ In Super Mega Baseball 3, runners leave as soon as the steal button is pressed, creating a fascinating timing mini-game that duplicates the tension of stealing a base in the real sport. Leave too early and the pitcher only needs to step off the rubber and throw to the bag; leave too late, and a good catcher should gun you down every time. Situation and timing now determine stealing success, and this minute change really makes swiping a bag a much more fun and interactive aspect. To combat this new level of runner control, pitchers can now perform pickoff moves with a simple press on the d-pad – pickoffs aren’t quite as nuanced as stealing. In fact, they feel more like the luck-based decisions of the past. If you try to pick off the runner and he actually is stealing… good job, you got him. But, if the runner isn’t going, he will automatically dive safely back to the bag. It’s disappointing to not be able to catch bad baserunners who are simply slow to react. What do you think of Super Mega Baseball's exaggerated art style? Love it! Doesn't bother me. Don't like it. Answer See Results Finally, added to this mix are catchers’ fielding abilities. Bad defensive catchers will see passed balls and dropped third strikes get by them, which love for the way it puts focus on an often-underappreciated aspect of the real sport. Collectively, the interplay between baserunners, pitchers, and catchers really elevates the excitement between pitches and inches Super Mega Baseball 3 toward a more complete and authentic baseball simulation. Training Traits  If stellar gameplay is the first thing I think of when recalling the Super Mega Baseball series, weird-looking players might be the second. Super Mega Baseball 3 brings back the exaggerated cartoony player models, to mixed results. While I appreciate the diversity and range of players, too many look unnaturally Frankensteined together from random parts. Outside my issues with some of the player models, Super Mega Baseball 3 is a great looking game. Players are full of personality thanks to creative and humorous animations. The 12 whimsical stadiums showcase beautiful new lighting options, including twilight, mist, and summer haze. All of this seems to come at a slight cost of longer-than-expected loading times. Also of note is the very accessible customization tools, including what might be the best logo designer in any sports game. It is so easy to create fun and imaginative logos that look real enough to grace the caps of a minor league team. My favorite new feature lies within the players’ internal makeup: situational traits. “ Aesthetics aside, my favorite new feature lies within the players’ internal makeup: situational traits. In addition to typical stats, players can now have up to two traits that trigger depending on the circumstances of a game. For instance, the RBI Man trait grants contact and power boosts when batting with runners in scoring position. The K Man trait gives a pitcher better control when facing two-strike counts. Some traits are even negative, such as runners who suffer a speed penalty when trying to steal or batters who wilt under the pressure of an RBI opportunity. These traits offer a new level of strategy when setting lineups or handling opposing teams. For instance, I chose to start a bench player whose trait gave him an edge against lefty pitching when facing a southpaw. Pitching against a batter who crushes inside pitching made me nibble on the outside corner, producing an untimely walk. These traits also help to differentiate players outside the traditional stat bars (Contact, Power, Speed, etc), breathing life into a roster of fictional players. Super Mega Baseball 3 not only adds these new traits but makes them easy to see in action. When a trait is triggered, a little audio cue alerts you that someone’s trait is active. Holding the right trigger, whether batting or pitching, brings up a list of active traits and their implications. It's very handy that these traits not only enhance the gameplay but are so easy to recognize and use to your advantage. Franchise Fun  Perhaps the biggest addition is the new multi-year Franchise Mode, which is very welcome after Super Mega Baseball 2 limited us to single seasons. While it won’t compete with the depth found in games like MLB The Show, I like that this streamlined take puts emphasis on finding and developing unique players. During the course of multiple seasons, various development opportunities pop up that allow managers to spend money for stat increases and/or trait gains. Seemingly simple, these chances lead to some really interesting choices. For instance, putting a batter on a red meat diet may increase their throwing strength significantly, but the added bulk will also slow their running speed. And since most of the development choices have some degree of randomness, any one outcome isn’t guaranteed. Eating all of those steaks might lead to a bigger jump in throwing ability than expected or it could grant the “Bad Jumps” negative trait… or both. I enjoy the coin-flipping animation that communicates what happens after the agonizing decision is finally made. Small descriptions help tell a story instead of just increasing or decreasing a numerical stat. “ Even though most of these decisions are simply new numbers, like “+4 to Contact skill,” I love that they are themed with a touch of humor. Players can jazzercise, join a reality show, or explore Black Market Acupuncture. Age-related events are similarly narrated; I had a young player master a yoga pose while my older infielder started suffering leg cramps. These small descriptions help tell a story instead of just increasing or decreasing a numerical stat. These training options are woven into a fairly light economic model that also includes player salaries – but, disappointingly, no trading. Instead, there is one giant free agent pool that you can use to replace players one for one, paying or gaining the difference in salary. It’s a relatively simple system that sees players move through this free agent pool until they eventually retire. While trading would have been nice, not relying on a heavy economics system puts the focus on the players, not managing mundane details like contracts, roster size, or ticket prices. Franchise rounds out a healthy set of modes, including exhibition games, single seasons, elimination brackets, and a ranked online “Pennant Chase.” Like the previous two games in the series, the sound design remains unimpressive. While crowd noise enhances the gameday atmosphere, the background and walkup music is pretty vanilla. I do like the addition of an announcer; hearing the goofy names like “Junior Young Sr.,” “Lacky Luster,” or “Nacho Crisp” makes me smile.   What We Said About Super Mega Baseball 2 From our May, 2018 Super Mega Baseball 2 review , by Caley Roark: \"Super Mega Baseball 2 is a grounded baseball simulation wrapped in an arcade-style look and feel. An accurate physics engine generates realistic hits, and it keeps stats and models fatigue and morale in interesting ways. This realism is betrayed by a few control issues that affect the timing when batting and an AI that doesn’t always behave as you’d expect. However, the unique Ego system allows you to tweak the difficulty of batting and fielding individually until you find the perfect challenge. And while it lacks the MLB license, you could use the accessible customization tools to recreate the entire MLB if you wanted to.\"  Score: 7.8 Did You Play Super Mega Baseball 2?

        "Content": "Taito's Bubble Bobble is one of those games that if you've never played, you really cannot consider yourself a gamer. Doesn't mater how many cars you jacked in GTA and how big of a boom you made in Halo . If you haven't dropped a quarter to spend time with Bub and Bob, then shame on you.  And speaking of shame, shame on Mforma for releasing this awful, lazy, watered down port of the classic arcade action-puzzle game.  About the only thing this game gets right is the sprite of Bub, which doesn't have really any frames of animation, mind you. The boards are rough approximations of the originals, filled with enemy creates that you must capture in bubbles and then pop to clear. They leave behind fruit to boost your score. You can also pick up bonus bubbles to spell EXTEND and get extra dinos.  Oh, and yes, the game does play the classic theme, but it's a screeching MIDI version that you will want to shut off as quick as humanly possible.  However, this version of Bubble Bobble -- which sells for $5.99 on the Sprint PCS Vision service -- is so ridiculously slow and buggy that our collective jaws dropped. The bonus bubbles that spell EXTEND would occasionally flash the sprite for an enemy or Bub. We jumped clean through bubble-d enemies. And when we did pop enemy bubbles, the monster fell off the screen, only to reappear at the top and keep on falling. How does something like that get out of test?  We tried the game on a Sanyo 8100, a pretty competent gaming phone. Not the best rig on the market, but it's in thousands of palms, so it's not a bad handset to benchmark with. Even powering off the phone and reloading the game didn't help. Do yourself and your cellphone bill a huge favor and pass on this bizarro bad port. ",

        "Subtitle": "EA’s latest hockey game has a wicked shot, even if its targets are questionable.",
        "Subheader": "By Matt Bertz Updated: Apr 21, 2020 1:03 pm Posted: Sep 13, 2019 1:00 pm",
        "Content": "Time is everything in fast-paced sports like hockey. A split second can determine whether a goalie makes a game-changing save, a player scores a career-altering goal, or a defender locks up that threat before they have a chance to get off the shot. For many years, EA’s NHL series felt too slow and unresponsive to be a difference maker, but that’s starting to change. Last year’s dramatically overhauled skating made the players feel dangerous on their skates again, and NHL 20 adds stick speed, making one-timers as effective as they were when first introduced in way back in NHL ‘94. This innovation takes the on-ice action forward, but at the same time, EA’s stubborn refusal to improve and refresh some of its most popular modes keeps NHL 20 from really breaking away from the pack.  For the past several years, even the most skilled hockey superstars had a hard time executing one-timers in NHL unless the passes were perfectly placed at their feet and their sticks were perfectly aligned. Even then, the lumbering shot animation often resulted in a groan-inducing whiff. NHL 20 fixes this with a welcome assortment of new animations that allow skaters in scoring positions to unleash shots from a wider degree of angles. The change had its intended effect; competitors in early matches seem more interested in trying to score goals with one-timers than fishing for goal-scoring exploits. Simply put, NHL 20 looks and plays a little more like real hockey.  Every IGN NHL Review Ever 23 Images  Goalies may not always make it across the crease for the save, but they are much more aware of the threats on the ice on the higher difficulty settings and do a better job of deflecting pucks into corners away from danger (and not into the crowd like we saw way too frequently during the beta). Sudden shots that require quick reactions often leave juicy rebounds at the crease, creating frantic scrambles for possession. Occasionally, pucks drop right beneath the goalie and they don’t have the awareness to cover it in a timely fashion, resulting in weak goals that go off their skates. EA, if you’re listening, please clean this up with the first patch.  EA also needs to address physicality, an area of NHL 20 that currently has no nuance. Too often when players collide, a giant check leaves the recipient on the ice – or they just glance off. NHL would benefit greatly from a FIFA-style jostling system that allowed stronger players to dislodge the puck from smaller and weaker players without completely knocking them off their skates.  NHL would benefit greatly from a FIFA-style jostling system. “  If one-timers are the signature feature of NHL 20, the assist goes to the reworked presentation. Doc Emrick and Eddie Olczyk may be a legendary broadcast team in real life, but their commentary in previous NHLs never captured their dynamism. This year, EA replaces them with the energetic play-by-play voice James Cybulski and Ray Ferraro, who moves from between the benches into the color commentary role. The duo delivers much livelier vibeole, though Ferraro doesn’t feel as integrated into the broadcast as he should be. And while EA says it captured many more hours of play-by-play than it typically does, the duo has way too many dead-mic moments, like when a rookie is sent out for a warm-up skate on his own or a player heads down the tunnel with a serious injury. Some Ferraro lines are repurposed from last year as well; in one instance he even references being down on the ice instead of in the booth.  The commentary pairs well with the reworked broadcast package. Each period ends with a highlight showcasing a smartly chosen big moment, and the slo-mo dynamic cameras do a much better job of capturing the play than the previous system. I hope EA adds some variety soon, though, because even though these highlights look much better, the sound effect and panning camera get tiresome after repetition. Showing player photos after goals is a nice touch as well, though it further drives home the long-held complaint that EA doesn’t do enough to improve player likenesses. Seeing what a player looks like in real life next to his clearly inadequate in-game model highlights how little work has gone into making this part of NHL 20 feel authentic.  You can watch a full match of the 1v1v1 multiplayer mode below:   Speaking of inadequacy, EA also made the questionable decision to leave the popular EASHL competitive online mode largely untouched. Little has been done to enhance the loadout system after it was introduced last year, and the terrible A.I. makes the mode downright unenjoyable when you don’t have enough friends online to fill out an entire roster. The defenders still join the rush with wild abandon, leaving your goalie exposed to breakaways at every turn.  Instead, EA invested in fleshing out the arcade-focused World of Chel modes like Ones and Threes modes, which now feature new outdoor rinks, longer-form tournaments, and a wider selection of cosmetic rewards. The new weekly challenges tease enticing items like rare jerseys, but the rigid system forces you to play uninteresting modes like Pro Am rather than playing those that interest you the most. Placing the hardcore EASHL in the same space as with the arcade-focused modes is a curious decision in this regard.   Microtransaction Reaction  Like the other EA Sports games, NHL 20 features a microtransaction-driven mode in Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT). You earn currency by completing challenges and competing online, and it doesn’t take long to acquire a roster comprised primarily of players rated in the low 80s by making smart buys in the auction house. From here, the grind begins. At the high end, HUT is clearly driven by people who either play hundreds of hours to earn elite player cards or those who take the shortcut and pay for them. If you’re not interested in competing in the pay-to-win pool, you can avoid this mode and instead play Franchise mode, World of Chel, Be A Pro, Threes, or Online Versus.   NHL 20 may not offer EASHL fans much to chew on, but it continues the long-overdue franchise mode revamp with a new coaching system that affects team building in a big way by giving each organization eight coaches whom you can hire and fire at will. Like in real life, each coach has his or her own philosophy of how the team should play, and this affects which players fit into their scheme, how their careers progress, and the line chemistry among teammates. The complex system takes time to wrap your head around and has the potential to be something special, but right now it’s still a confusing work in progress. Strangely, you can’t hire coaches from other teams, which is the primary way the coaching carousel works in the NHL. You also need to overpay way too frequently to get coaches to sign on, and once you bring them in all your information about how players fit into your scheme is out of date. Having to re-scout every free agent to see how they mesh with your new coach robs you of that critical early window where a new coach brings in players.  The coaching system needs work, but franchise mode also benefits from many nice quality-of-life improvements. Player ratings and contract demands fluctuate based on their performance, you can trade expiring contracts, and the sim engine is much faster this year. The new trade finder helps find takers for players you plan to shop. Teams seem much more interesting in trading overall, though the trade finder rarely works when you want to know what assets it will take to pry a desired player from another team. The trade deadline also isn’t as active as it is in the real NHL, though offseason movement feels on par. The scouting system introduced last year is also harder to exploit this year, too.  Check out a full period of NHL 20 gameplay in the video below:   Those who prefer to build their teams in Hockey Ultimate Team won’t find much new in NHL 20 outside of a new card-opening animation, new legendary players, and the Squad Battles mode first introduced in FIFA that lets you compete against other people’s teams in offline matches for unique rewards. The improvements are nice, but HUT still lacks depth found in Madden and FIFA.  The same can be said for Be A Pro, NHL’s career mode. EA added nothing of note, even though it’s desperately begging for a revamp.  Online Versus fans have alumni teams for each current franchise and a few defunct ones like the North Stars, though these rosters seem hastily thrown together without much forethought. Many great players are missing due to licensing, which is an unfortunate reality, but the rosters have bigger issues. Jason Spezza was an elite player for the Ottawa Senators, but only has his current 80 overall rating. The Minnesota Wild roster curiously lacks franchise leading scorers Marian Gaborik and Mikko Koivu, even though both are in the game. Ron Hextall is on the Nordiques alumni team, but he wears his Flyers helmet in games. These seem like easy fixes.",

        "Title": "Mortal Kombat 11 - The Joker DLC Review",

        "Subheader": "By Mitchell Saltzman Updated: May 28, 2021 5:47 pm Posted: Jan 29, 2020 11:08 pm",
        "Content": "With previous appearances in Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, Injustice, and Injustice 2 The Joker is basically a Netherrealm fighting game veteran at this point. That’s significant because his newest iteration in Mortal Kombat 11 is easily his best one yet, absolutely nailing The Joker’s penchant to make you laugh one moment, and then think “oh my god, this sick, sadistic freak” the next. Mortal Kombat 11’s M rating certainly helps enable that, but The Joker is also simply a ton of fun to play, resulting in one of Mortal Kombat 11’s best DLC characters so far.  Every IGN Mortal Kombat Game Review 39 Images  The best thing about The Joker from an aesthetic point of view is the look of his moveset. It consists mostly of techniques familiar from his appearances in other games, but with some new and wildly entertaining spins. His gun is now a Batman hand puppet that Joker will actually talk to if you hold down the button and delay the shot; His short-range knife from Injustice is now a cane that he wields with the flourish of a circus performer; and his gas canisters are now exploding jack-in-the-boxes that are used in all new fun ways.  Above all else, Joker just looks like he’s having fun out there, and it makes him really fun to play as a result.   Of course, it also helps that, upon first impression, he seems really, really strong. His cane gives him a far-reaching high attack that is excellent for whiff punishes and establishing his range in the neutral; he’s got great zoning in his first competitive variation, fantastic set ups in his second, and huge combo damage potential in his third. Each variation seems uniquely viable so far, which is great because it allows for a lot of versatility in how Joker is played.  My personal favorite variation is the third one, which outfits him with a launching special move in his “Kapow” spring-loaded boxing glove, allowing him to convert big damage off of his combo strings. In addition to that, this variation also has a one-of-a-kind gas can special move that allows him to drop a trail of gasoline and ignite it for big damage over time.  Joker is appropriately very mind game heavy, with the ability to hold many of his special moves and release them right as the opponent makes a move. Even his Fatal Blow can be held and canceled, a quality shared only by Johnny Cage, which allows for all sorts of nastiness, especially considering that he has a krushing blow on his forward throw that can be utilized when the fatal blow is on cooldown. It’s also one of the most satisfying krushing blows in the game, featuring the Joker literally exploding his opponent’s balls (or just general nether region for those lacking.)   This allows The Joker to be a character who is extremely good at comebacks since he becomes a lot more dangerous when he’s in fatal blow territory. Any block string can become a guessing game between whether he will fatal blow, cancel it into a krushing blow throw, or into another combo. Not to mention, it also gives his less combo heavy variations a way to deal substantial damage by using the fatal blow cancel to extend otherwise impossible combos.  On top of all that, he also has very solid damage without even needing meter thanks to a fast meterless launching combo across every variation, a great far-reaching low poke, and a fantastic uppercut with great range,  All of this strength isn’t balanced by any single glaring weakness, but a bunch of small inconveniences that you’ll just have to deal with when you decide to choose Joker. He doesn’t really have any moves that leave him with advantage on block, forcing you to always give up your turn when your pressure is stopped; he doesn’t have a fantastic way to close the distance if the opponent wants to keep him out; and his otherwise excellent poke with his cane hits high, which can be easily ducked under and uppercutted if it’s scouted.  Even outside of his combat look and feel, Joker is similarly excellent. Veteran voice actor Richard Epcar reprises his role from Injustice and Injustice 2 and turns in an exceptional performance as the clown prince of crime, expertly evoking the same psychotic glee that makes Mark Hamill’s take on the character so iconic.",

        "Title": "Pokemon Sun and Moon Review",
        "Subtitle": "Sun and Moon greatly improve upon Pokemon’s formula and craft a world worth exploring. ",
        "Subheader": "By Kallie Plagge Updated: May 2, 2017 6:19 pm Posted: Nov 15, 2016 2:00 pm",
        "Content": "Update: Pokemon Sun and Moon has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .   Like re-reading a favorite book in an unfamiliar place, Pokemon Sun and Moon combine a lot of my favorite things about Pokemon into an adventure that reminded me why I fell in love with this RPG series in the first place without simply repeating what came before. With equal attention given to roleplaying (my first obsession) and battle (my more recent interest), Sun and Moon both honor the 20-year legacy of Pokemon and improve upon it in a number of ways, making for a surprising and engaging tropical adventure that is as much about the journey as it is the destination.  Arguably the biggest and most important change in Pokemon Sun and Moon is the Island Challenge in its new setting, Alola. Instead of taking on a series of gyms as we’ve done many times before, you embark on a variety of battles and non-combat challenges, such as scavenger hunts and quizzes, that culminate in a fight against a stronger foe. One trial sent me on a hunt for ingredients so we could attract a local Pokemon with a traditional meal, while another involved memorizing luau-esque dances atop a volcano. It’s similar enough to previous Pokemon games to avoid alienating veterans but also an inventive take on the formula that fits with and plays off of the island setting beautifully.   Bringing the challenges out into the world, rather than keeping each step toward becoming a champion segmented in its own gym, helped Alola feel more like a place where things happen instead of an overworld map. It also kept the Island Challenge from becoming mindless — I couldn’t autopilot my way through it like I could with a lot of X and Y, for example. I didn’t always know when or where a trial would start or what exactly would happen when I got there, and that kept me on my toes, frequently fine-tuning my team and trying out a lot more Pokemon than I usually do during an initial run. The themed minigames also kept each trial surprising until I reached the final fight.  The Island Challenge is a welcome change from traditional, run-of-the-mill gyms. “  The trials are a good way to get to know the charming captains that run them and learn about the history and traditions of Alola — even on the first island, I’d heard bits and pieces about the elusive “guardian Deity” Pokemon and come to understand the trials’ purpose in the local legends surrounding them. After two trials, I was as fully invested in the new region as I was with my familiar quest to become the champion.  The reward for completing a trial is a Z-Crystal, an item which allows the Pokemon holding it to attack with an extra-strong ultimate move once per battle. It’s Alola’s take on Mega Evolutions, designed to add something to the familiar mix of battle, and I have yet to see past its novelty. I didn’t really need to use these Z-Moves during my Island Challenge (though part of that was wanting a bit more flexibility with difficulty, which Pokemon has always been good at granting by making these things optional). They’re kind of cool to have as a panic button in a tough battle, so I’m interested to see if they’ll be allowed in official competitive matches and how they might shake things up.  A Whole New World  Alola is the most inspired region in Pokemon so far, and that made exploring it fun and rewarding. Instead of just looking for items or places to grind, I was taught to expect the unexpected. Alola is based on Hawaii, and from the smaller, quieter island you call home to another with a luxurious resort and a volcano, each of the four main islands has its own feel. I definitely didn’t think I’d find myself in an Old West-style ranch town, for example, and was delighted as I walked through it. It doesn’t feel out of place, though, since it’s where the new horse Pokemon, Mudsdale, is kept for riders looking to traverse rocky trails — which I’d need later on.  Alola is the most inspired region in Pokemon so far. “  Among the surprises, there are a lot of details in Alola that nail the tropical theme and fit well. The Alola forms of first-generation Pokemon, like the more colorful Grimer and the infamously tall Exeggutor, for example, are smart changes that are in sync with the ecology of the islands. They also work well with the strong roster of new Pokemon that features interesting type combinations with some pretty good stat spread options, and I’m excited to see how they work their way into the competitive scene. I’ve happily added quite a few to my team, like Charjabug, a tankier take on the electric/bug typing previously belonging only to the more fragile Joltik and Galvantula. The music, too, is island-inspired (and, in some cases, based on other Pokemon regions) and reimagines a lot of the original music, including the battle theme, quite well. Places, people, and Pokemon that connect even in subtle ways make Sun and Moon more engaging.  Victory Road to Hana The 30-plus-hour story of the Sun and Moon adventure also contributes to that vibrant world-building. It’s the first Pokemon game in a while that kept me focused on the journey and discovery, rather than setting my sights on the post-game and grinding until I reached it. That’s not to say that the plot is compelling on its own — it’s a fine story for a Pokemon game, but it’s plagued by awkward dialogue on the part of Team Skull and some predictable events. There are times when it pokes fun at itself for its sillier parts, and I appreciated that even when I wasn’t as excited about a scene.  But there’s a general mystery to Alola that serves as a carrot drawing you forward, and as a result those story pitfalls take a back seat to let Alola and its inhabitants speak for themselves. Even the slower scenes are made better with vastly improved camera work — learning about how Pokemon battles work for the thousandth time is less boring when the conversation looks almost like an anime rather than static frames, and the characters are more expressive than in any previous game. And almost everything from the new Alola forms of first-generation Pokemon (like Marowak, which went from ground-type to a fire-ghost wielding a flaming bone club) to the Island Challenge in general is different enough from what I’m used to as a lifelong player, in that they feel like fresh discoveries. What’s Old Is New Again  Sun and Moon are also approachable for new or rusty players thanks to a streamlined battle interface. The move-selection screen now has way more detail at a glance, including information about what the moves do if you forget. Move effectiveness is also displayed, which means it’s a lot easier to battle effectively without having the type matchups memorized. It’s a good way to learn the nuances of battle, and it’s not cluttered or obtrusive if you do know your way around the type chart. For me, it was especially helpful in quickly learning the strengths and weaknesses of new Alola Pokemon — and they grew on me faster, too.   The new interface is one of quite a few upgrades that add up to a great improvement. The bloated HM system has been replaced with Poke Ride, which opens up Alola to exploration early on. It’s a seriously important change that frees up your party for the interesting new Pokemon (my favorite being the ghost/fairy Mimikyu, who dresses up in a Pikachu costume because it’s lonely and wants friends), and there’s a much wider variety of Pokemon available at the start than in previous generations, too. Having access to ghost-type Pokemon right away made the early team-building process a lot more fun than in the days of being surrounded by rodents, bugs, and birds for three routes.  Upgrades both big and a bit smaller add up to a great improvement. “ There are even small upgrades to more recent additions to Pokemon, and though they’re less noticeable, they’re welcome. Pokemon Refresh is a slightly altered version of X and Y’s Pokemon Amie that serves more of a tangible purpose in healing status conditions after battle. Trading with and battling real-life players is similar to the previous generation, complete with one of my favorite features, Wonder Trade, but with a festival-themed site as the base of operations and a variety of item rewards for engaging in multiplayer. There’s also a cool new minigame-style feature called Poke Pelago in which you upgrade a series of small personal islands, one of which makes the tedium of hatching eggs easier (finally) while another works like Super Training. As an avid Pokemon player, the littlest additions did a lot to make doing the things that are still the same in Sun and Moon better this time around.",

        "Content": "Somewhere between a lucid dream, a children’s show, and an acid trip, you’ll find Wattam. The latest game from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi is an absurd and colorful adventure full of anthropomorphised objects, laugh-out-loud goals, and a dreamlike sense of floaty imprecision. It’s not the meatiest of games (despite literally letting you play as meat), but it’s a ridiculous joy all the same while it lasts.  Wattam doesn’t really fit into any specific genre box, but you could most closely liken it to a third-person puzzle game. Bear with me here: you control a mustachioed green cube called the Mayor who wears a bowler hat with a confetti bomb inexplicably tucked underneath it. He starts out alone in the dark, but simple quest prompts guide you (and potentially a friend in local co-op) along to complete tasks that slowly repopulate the world around you.   Everything in Wattam, including the ground you are walking on, has a cute little face and a pair of arms, each one bubbling and giggling with smiles nearly the entire time with happy voices that were surely recorded by actual children. Before long, the Mayor is surrounded by anthropomorphized rocks, flowers, and trees, as well as odder things like loose body parts, pieces of colorful poop, living numbers, and roughly 100 other smiling object-friends.  And, in what is probably the loveliest part of Wattam, every single one of them is a playable character. While the Mayor is your main hero, you can swap freely to any of the others you’ve brought back from the void of nothingness at any time. Yes, even the poop. The ones you aren’t directly controlling (or holding hands with) will idly wander around and do their own thing, making them feel more alive than just an avatar waiting to be controlled. I was genuinely smiling the entire time I played Wattam – it’s just so pleasant to be in this weird and friendly world.  It’s just so pleasant to be in Wattam's weird and friendly world. “  Most of Wattam’s objectives ask you to use certain characters in specific ways. For example, one had me take control of a tree and use it to eat other characters and then regrow them as food, while a set of other particularly fun ones had me stack different characters on top of each other to try and exactly match the height of a tall golden bowling pin. There’s very little challenge to any of them, but the are all so gleefully absurd that I had fun the whole way through the two-and-a-half hours it took me to finish the main story. Granted, that’s not super long.  There’s at least some mechanical variety between them to keep things fresh. While most of the objects are functionally similar – nearly all of them can run around, climb others, and hold hands to create adorable little chains – some have specific tricks, ranging from the tree’s eating I mentioned earlier to things like a desk fan being able to blow wind or some balloons that can float high in the sky. The imprecise character swapping that’s tied to the right control stick can be a pain to manage at times, but there’s rarely ever a danger or reason to hurry that could turn that minor annoyance into a larger frustration.  15 Weird and Adorable Playable Characters From Wattam 16 Images  While Wattam is filled to the brim with thematic surprises (I will be amazed if anyone could accurately guess what’s coming next at any point in this game), it doesn’t take too long before the loop of completing straightforward tasks to unlock the next set of characters over and over becomes fairly clear. There are some moments that break this loop up with unique activities like a faux-boss battle against a faceless doll or an investigation to find a piece of sushi’s lost fish egg children, but these ideas come and go disappointingly quickly.  Wattam isn’t trying to be an action game or a detective game, though, and these asides instead feel like your characters are kids at a playground adorably playing make-believe. What Wattam is trying to be is exactly the mess of incongruous characters it presents you with, happingly holding hands and smiling as they get turned into poop or blown up with a confetti bomb for no reason other than it’s fun. It succeeds heartily at being just that, and there are some genuinely hilarious goofs and jokes throughout. Stepping back from it, it’s clear that if Wattam wasn’t such a charming game then it would likely be a pretty boring one.  If Wattam wasn’t such a charming game then it would likely be a pretty boring one, but it's got charm out the wazoo. “  Thankfully, it’s got charm coming out the wazoo. The character design is fantastic, the world is colorful and lovely, the childish voices are a silly delight, the scenarios it throws at you are often creative and strange, and the consistently incredible music ties it all together. Even beyond the main theme song (which is Katamari Damacy-levels of excellent), every character has a unique instrumentation or melody that takes over when you control them that gives each a burst of extra personality.",

        "Content": "Boot up Crazy Machines Elements , and the influence of Incredible Machine is immediately evident. Well, it's more than \"evident\" -- it's blatant. Just like Incredible Machine, a series started in the early '90s, each Crazy Machines Elements level gives you a physics-based objective like getting a ball to roll across some planks and fall through a hoop. It's up to you to use your smarts and the preset toolbox items (toy cars, ropes and so on) to complete the task at hand.    All of that is cool. Studying fireworks-based puzzles and creating chain reactions between candles and teapots in an attempt to get bowling balls into shopping carts makes for an interesting hook. The challenge that comes with filling in the blank spots to make a machine work is like a Mad Libs episode of Mythbusters. Most of the game's 100 puzzles are fun, but the whole experience never becomes anything more than a simple distraction with an inflated $10 price tag.  Crazy Machines Elements could be a bit more challenging, though. There's no penalty for taking an exorbitant amount of time on a puzzle or trying a solution over and over again. You're only goal beyond polishing off a given objective to unlock the next is collecting however many bolts are hovering in the level. Once you know a solution, figuring out how to make objects collide to collect the bolts isn't all that tough, either.  Developer FAKT Software , which has released multiple versions of Crazy Machines on various platforms, tries to add value to the digital download by including leaderboards (which do take your time spent on a puzzle into consideration), challenges and the promise of downloadable content, but none of this makes Crazy Machines Elements any more enticing as the same problems plague these modes. There's the option to create your own challenges, but the game doesn't pack a way to share them so it's useless.   Could be crazier... Adding to the feeling that you're just not getting your money's worth is the fact that Crazy Machines Elements feels like a bad port. The controls are sluggish (even when using PlayStation Move), saving takes far too long and there's slowdown and screen tearing with the goofy looking professor who just stands on the menu screens.",

        "Title": "Showtime Championship Boxing Review",
        "Subtitle": "TKO in the first round.",
        "Subheader": "By Chris Adams Updated: May 14, 2012 5:53 am Posted: Nov 14, 2007 1:19 am",
        "Content": "For the past twenty years, Showtime has been one of the preeminent channels for live boxing events with their Showtime Championship Boxing program. So it's disappointing that publisher DSI's Nintendo DS game of the same name features none of the name boxers that have appeared on that program, and little of its polish and excitement either. Showtime Championship Boxing from developer Nikitova Games is a game that at a glance (and perhaps in screenshots) looks like a solid 3D sports title, but upon closer inspection is a sloppy mess that wouldn't be allowed to step foot in the ring.  The game offers seventeen fictional boxers such as Lazy Lorenzo and Punchbag Pat to select from, although in most modes the player can only select from about six fighters. There are no stats per boxer, but in the Boxer Profiles section of the game, strengths and weaknesses for each character are described. The player fights through (and unlocks) five different boxing modes, each essentially the same as the last but with an extra boxer or two to face before being awarded the belt.  The game uses the four face buttons to block high, low, left or right. Tapping the L or R button while holding one of these buttons throws a punch. It may sound odd to use the same buttons for blocking and punching, but the L and R system makes it very easy to alternate between attack and defense, as well as land any punch without having to remember complicated button combinations. Looking beyond its decent controls however, the game begins to fall apart.  There are serious discrepancies between scoring and visual feedback. In my first round, I delivered upward of a hundred visibly clean jabs to my opponent's face, yet it barely dented his energy. My boxer, on the other hand, was struck maybe a dozen times and quickly knocked down. I can understand playing down the effectiveness of certain types of punches, but this has to be reinforced visually to let the player know it isn't working. If an enemy has been wobbling his head from basic punches for 3 straight minutes, he shouldn't be standing.  When a boxer goes down, there is no button mashing or gameplay mechanic to build up energy. In fact, pressing any button during this time, or before and after a fight, skips the cutscene completely. This can be jarring as a slip of the button can take the player from their last punch to the main menu in about two seconds.  A common problem with bad sports games is allowing the player to exploit their opponent's AI and play the game in a way that's unrealistic. This game is so unbalanced that almost any opponent can be beaten to pieces by using the same punch over and over. I found that by performing a left hook with the Y and L buttons over and over until my boxer ran out of stamina, blocking with the X button until my stamina returned and then repeating, I could take down most opponents in a matter of seconds, often resulting in a first round TKO. In fact, picking one punch and exploiting it is so reliable that fights can really be played by only looking at the top screen HUD, because what the 3D boxers are doing down on the bottom screen has little bearing on the outcome.  Boxers do become more difficult as the game progresses, in both punch strength and frequency. However, their AI is simple enough that they always, reliably dodge one punch by leaning in the opposite direction. So if the player throws a body shot with the right hand and it's blocked, they can immediately throw a series of left hooks that will almost always connect. By selecting two opposite punches, alternating between them and blocking every time stamina bottoms out, even the toughest fighters can often be TKO'd in the first few rounds. Because of this, all five game modes can be completed in an hour or so.  So why doesn't this game get a 1 out of 10? Because in spite of its laundry list of flaws, it's still inexplicably fun. Bobbing around the ring and pummeling on a guy seems to be a universally enjoyable experience, as long as the controls are responsive (which they are). While the game is severely unbalanced and far too easy to excel at, the 3D fighters are handled well enough to keep things amusing.  The game is mostly 3D and like the programming, has its share of good and bad. On the good side, the 3D boxer models are well detailed and textured, substantially higher in their polycounts than most 3D characters on the DS. The 3D rings look good and the pre- and post-fight cinematics, although playing at a very low frame rate, add character to the events. On the bad side there's, well, everything else. The crowd is made out of flat billboard images (think Doom), thrown together so lazily that the seams between each chunk of people is visible. Couple that with the fact that the 2D crowd is angled back, and it looks like someone printed out posters of fans and laid them out over an arena of empty seats. The top screen displays a pixel-animated crowd, but they look muddy and barely animate.  The boxers also animate poorly, which is a shame because standing still they look pretty good. Their movements are jerky and lack any anticipation or follow through. Sometimes they walk and sometimes they glide without moving their feet at all. Each time a blow is landed on an opponent, his head wobbles violently like a real-life bobble-head. The head seems to wobble regardless of where a boxer is hit, even in the gut. The characters are rigged poorly, which refers to how their polygons are set up to bend as they move. So when a boxer blocks for example, his shoulders get stuck in an unnatural triangle shape, essentially breaking the model. When fat boxers hunch over, their stomachs deflate into an L shape. It ain't pretty.  In addition to the seventeen sometimes-selectable boxers, there are four different arenas and the player can adjust round count, weight class (welterweight and heavyweight only) and shorts color. Only the Single Fight mode is initially available. Once the player beats that, the Amateur Belt unlocks, then the Contender Belt, the Showtime Belt and finally King of the Ring mode, where every boxer must be beat in a row without round times. Cut scenes and sound can be turned off, and the game offers information on controls, hints and tips, and boxer profiles that reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each character. A two-player local wireless mode is available, although it requires two copies of the game. ",

        "Subtitle": "Margot's DS debut should please players addicted to words ... wait, what do you mean this isn't a DS game?",
        "Subheader": "By Lucas M. Thomas Updated: May 11, 2012 1:00 pm Posted: Nov 11, 2008 11:55 pm",
        "Content": "You know the type. Frequently seen with the morning paper tucked folded under their arm, with the day's crossword halfway completed. Known to awkwardly insert uncommon terms into conversations, finding joy in the confused looks cast their way by others. Currently schooling you in fifteen simultaneous on-going sessions of Facebook Scrabulous. They are the vocabulary addicts. They are the word nerds.  And they're also often DS owners, a fact that's been exploited by several publishers, including Nintendo itself, in the past -- first-party efforts appealing to this audience have previously included the brain-training series of mental exercise games, and this past spring's Crosswords DS . Margot's Word Brain is the latest title to hit Nintendo's portable and attempt to capitalize on that same lexicon-crazed crowd. And it does so by closely copying the conventions created by those same Nintendo games, along with several other past word-based puzzlers.   (But wait just a minute -- this isn't a DS review. This is a Wii title, pressed to disc and played with the Wii Remote -- not a portable cartridge controlled by a touch screen and stylus. You could have fooled me, though, because Margot's Word Brain on Wii is an almost exact copy of its DS edition. Right down to the limits on the interface. I'll put those thoughts on hold for a bit, though, to let you read through the description of Margot's style and gameplay -- the same as first seen in the game's DS version. Then I'll come back to a critique of the compromises made in the Wii transition at the end.)    Margot on the left, gameplay on the right -- it's almost as if this game was intended for two separate screens. Hmmm.  First, the similarities to Brain Age . Like that popular 2006 title, the DS version of Margot's Word Brain begins by having you turn your DS system on its side, to hold it in \"book style\" mode. Also like Brain Age, this game features a smiling, helpful instructor character (the titular Margot) who explains each game's rules, and offers encouragement and score assessments after each session. And, also like Brain Age, the substance of Word Brain's gameplay is made up of timed, mind-exercising activities that are meant to test your mental agility more than your hand-eye coordination.  The content of those activities, though, is where the Brain Age comparison ends -- and where the Crosswords DS comparison begins. Each Word Brain game is themed on word recognition and vocabulary, just like the modes included in the first-party Crosswords DS package from earlier this year. A couple of the activities are eerily similar to those seen there, too -- Word Brain has its own Word Search, of course, as well as an analog for Anagrams. There are six activities, all together. Let's take a quick tour of each one.  Word Search is what you'd expect, with a twist -- Margot offers you a handful of vocabulary words, you're given a few seconds to memorize them, and then a box of jumbled letters appears in which lie hidden the same handful of words. You have to track them down and tap the first and last letter in each one to tell the game you've found it -- not as elegant an interface as Crosswords DS, but it's functional. (Though random tapping could be used to cheat.)  Word Mine is the clone of Crosswords DS Anagrams, as you're given a set of six letters and tasked to make as many three-, four-, five- and six-letter words out of them as you can, as fast as you can. It's straightforward and works well, even if doesn't have a lot of depth.  Word Run is where the game starts to move away from aping Nintendo's titles, but then just as quickly begins to look a lot like word-based games that have come from other publishers -- it's a design very similar to Scrabble , where you alternate back and forth with the Margot A.I. and try to build a crossword puzzle from scratch. It's a bit more space-constricted than its board game inspiration, though-- if you can run Margot out of room to fit any more words on the 6 x 6 game board, you'll win the round.  Word Link is a clone of Bookworm , the popular PopCap flash game where tiles fall down onto the screen, you match them up into words like you'd match up like-colored gems in Bejeweled , and the tiles disappear from the stack as more letters fall down from above to take their place.  Hyper TXT isn't a knock-off of any past video game, but that doesn't mean you haven't already played it -- it's a re-creation of cell phone texting turned into a playable game challenge. Words appear on the left screen and you have to text them as quickly as you can -- meaning that you have to press \"2\" on the touch screen number pad once to make an A, twice for a B, three times for a C and so on. If your brain has been trained to do this already through your hours of practice on your Motorola RAZR, you'll easily rack up high scores here. But that's not to say that it's very fun.  And, finally, Word Safe -- which probably also has some previously-published free online version somewhere, but I haven't played it if it does. In it, rings of letters are arranged on the touch screen and you'll once again form words by linking up adjacent letters to one another. If the letter you need isn't adjacent, though, you can spin each ring of letters around to re-position it and get it to where it is. This one was the most challenging of the six, and also the most unique.   (OK, back to the Wii critique now. At this point in the DS review, the article transitioned into its Closing Comments and I assessed that Margot's Word Brain, while a derivative compilation of other, past vocabulary video games, was still fair, fun and worth a look for serious word nerds. But while that mostly also holds true for the Wii edition, this home console version has an additional compromise to consider -- control.  The IR pointing-and-clicking functionality of the Wii Remote is just not nearly as fast and accurate as the stabbing taps of the stylus you'd otherwise be using if you were playing the DS version. The recognition of what you're trying to click on on the screen is also worse on Wii, which slows down all six of the games and makes it much more difficult to complete words correctly and have any real fun.  What's worse, the game is a clear port up from the DS build, as if you try to direct your cursor across to the left side of the screen, it'll be blocked by an invisible barrier. Why? Because you can only register touches on the right side, touch-capable screen on the DS when it's held in book style. The developers must have brought this build up from the DS as quickly as they could for something that obvious to be left in place. It's odd, and a little embarassing.)",

        "Content": "I never really thought about it before, but light-gun games are apparently hard to make. They always seemed pretty easy to me. You don't really need a story, but there's always a high drama action storyline (i.e. somebody did something bad and you have to stop them, oh and the world is at stake), and there is a gaggle of hooligans running around shooting at you. The Virtua Cop, Time Crisis and even the Area 51 series all showed interesting variations of this formula, and each was good, \"light\" fun.   Endgame , however, does not fall into the same tier as these games, as it looks, feels, and plays contrived and utterly forgettable. Endgame made me realize that there are all sorts of little tricks in making a light-gun title, consisting of timing, respectable synchronization, and originality, which it regrettably lacks.   Gamplay, Graphics, and Sound  The core game follows the story of Jade Cornell and her friend Tyler. Tyler knows too much about a secret VR technology that's suspect but potentially a multimillion dollar making product. The top security team from EuroDream has discovered his knowledge and within the first 30 seconds of the game, he's kidnappad.  Next up is Jade Cornell, a Milla Jovovich lookalike with squirrelly eyes, boxy boobs, and a knack for having an endless supply of bullets. As Jade, you plow through five different levels, in which she shoots, ducks, and continues to shoot her incessantly evil enemies, all of whom are part of some big plot to keep the product's real purpose secret. Ahhhh, conspiracy and murder.  But see, the plot doesn't really matter. Even with this moderately boring storyline, the game is far from holding its own. Cunning Development's game feels stale and uninteresting, like something that was created to appear in the used game bin from the start. It's kind of like already chewed gum, Hydrox, Twizzlers, or Dr, Skipper (a Dr. Pepper rip-off). Even more sad than that is Endgame is a complete Time Crisis rip-off, a wholesale theft of Namco's popular light-gun series in just about every way, except the little bit about originality and innovation. It's unapologetic in its thievery, making me want to go play Time Crisis 2 instead, which is just fine.   Yes, it's a functional light-gun game, you shoot at stuff, and you pass through levels to get to the end, but every single iota of its design feels old, borrowed, and second rate. You duck and reload at the same time, special colored bullets appear from enemy guns which actually do major damage, and there are even enemies with bullet proof shields, just like in Time Crisis. Naturally, Namco's light-gun game and every other game use ideas from previous games, but at least those developers tried to put their own spin on the gameplay, whereas here, 99% of the gameplay is a poor-man's copy of Time Crisis.  The parts that hurt Endgame, aside from the lack of originality and passion, are the little things. The game is sloppily made. The cutscenes appear to be cut off in the middle of their sequences. The game lasts a few seconds after the last guy died in several places. No matter how many times I synchronized my gun, it was slightly off center, whether I used the GunCon 1 or GunCon 2. I couldn't even get the GunCon 2 to work in the top USB slot, which is weird, since the two ports should work identically (it does work in the secondary slot), but it should work in either.  The CG work is poor and the character's eyes move about like they're all on some kind of insane amphetamine. The whole Mighty Joe Jupiter set of mini-games failed to make me laugh or smile, but in stead made me cringe, and its very concept felt like a poor-man's Time Crisis copy. The menu system (like finding synchronization) and the manual (figuring out the story) are poorly organized. And the two-player mode is difficult to locate. If you take a second to look at most of the levels, you'll notice the graphics are pretty poor, even through Cunning used Renderware. There is flickering, textures tearing, and even a little bit of slowdown.  There are few upsides to the game, which I am obliged to mention. There are some neat little graphic effects, such as bullet holes left in walls, smoky clouds appear from locations you've shot, and tons of breakable objects. You can shoot enemies more than once, and then watch them recoil after your shot. The enemy AI reacts decently: Enemies that grab their limbs in the area they were shot, and they duck and hide, often running from place to place in the environment. And the box art is attractive: A Milla Jovovich redhead in a shiny leather jacket will attract 16-year-old guys real quick. It looks good to me.  But, aside from that those details, which you could find in any light-gun game from the last four years, Endgame is a weak effort in every facet of its creation, and I strongly recommend staying away from it.

        "Content": "After months of waiting, Pac-Man: Championship Edition finally comes to the iPhone. Based on the bestselling Xbox Live Arcade game, Pac-Man: Championship Edition is brilliant retro redux of classic Pac-Man -- perhaps the best since Super Pac-Man. Pac-Man rushes through mazes, gobbling up dots and turning the tables on ghosts by noshing on power pellets, just like the arcade original. But now the action is timed and a puzzle element is introduced. Cleaning up the dots on one side of the screen causes an icon to appear on the other, which releases a whole new series of dots. If you find a groove, you can follow one continuous string of dots from one side to the other, keeping the ghosts on their heels with power pellets and raking in major bonuses.  On iPhone, Pac-Man: Championship Edition offers a lot of new content. In addition to several new Championship mazes, there is a plethora of Mission mazes that ask you to meet specific goals within time limits and Challenge mazes that are tough as nails and require top scores. Completing any of these mazes unlocks new ones – up to a point. Though there are 15 Championship mazes, only 5 are in the initial download. Only 20 of the 120 Mission mazes can be opened. Namco has imbued Pac-Man: Championship Edition with microtransactions aplenty. To unlock all of the content, such as the extra 10 Championship mazes and the entire library of 20 Challenge mazes (that's right – not a single one is unlocked with your first purchase), you must buy the $2.99 Expansion Pack.  This, dear reader, is insanity. You want to offer extra stuff down the road? That's great. But to sell a gamer a download (not even offer it for free, like ngmoco's Eliminate) with only a mere fraction of the total content -- less than 75-percent of the game -- and then immediately ask for more money is a prime way to turn a good thing sour real fast. I am extremely disappointed to see this tactic.   Though small, Pac-Man: CE looks sharp on the iPhone.  Of course, none of this matters if the controls cannot keep up. Unfortunately, Pac-Man also stumbles here. The virtual button controls are, in my opinion, awful. I tried them a few times and found them completely unintuitive. The swipe controls are much better – but not perfect. To direct Pac-Man, you swipe the screen. When Pac is coming up to a turn, you swipe up and that's the way he scoots when he reaches the intersection. You need to be very careful when taking your finger off the screen, though. If you drag your finger even a smidge while lifting it, Pac-Man will read that as a direction. Pac moves slowly at the start of a game, so this is not much of a problem right away. But as you close in on that five-minute mark and Pac is screaming around the maze, these swipe snafus are deadly. I lost many lives and messed up many patterns due to this annoyance.

        "Content": "After trading fisticuffs with a Transformer, cartwheeling around a bullet-spewing tank controlled by evil clowns, and using a moose to buck my way through killer robots, it’s safe to say that there are very few games – if any – quite like Nier: Automata. At different times it’s a hack-and-slash, an RPG, a shoot-‘em-up, a brawler, and even a text adventure. But no matter which style it is at any given moment, this dazzling hybrid delivers 30-plus hours of fantastically fun action, remarkable locations, and a story so weird I doubt I’ll forget it anytime soon.   Nier: Automata takes place in a desolate but stunning futuristic dystopia where humanity has fled to the moon after an extraterrestrial invasion, leaving behind an army of androids to fight the aliens’ more primitive but prolific machines. It’s a world where lush green tendrils of ivy coil around the massive skeletal remains of crumbling skyscrapers and tears of rust streak down the sides of old factories, with rotund buildings and looming cranes dominating the skyline. Automata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing. “  Automata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing to look at on the PlayStation 4, but especially on the PlayStation 4 Pro. It doesn’t go above 1080p on the Pro, but colors appear fresh and vivid, while better lighting and shading bring the world into sharper focus. I did encounter a few hiccups that knocked the frame rate below 60fps and witnessed a fair share of texture pop-in, but they only pockmarked Automata’s lovely features ever so slightly. That, or I was too enchanted with the soaring, chorus-filled soundtrack to really notice; Automata will definitely be joining its predecessor’s score on my playlist.  The story that takes place amongst the tumbled remains of abandoned superstructures is bizarre and entertaining, if somewhat haphazard. First as an android named 2B and later as other characters experiencing the same events from different perspectives, your job is to fight the alien machines and bring an end to the war. The quirky, full-tilt drama that unfolds as you bounce between Earth and the moon is an intriguing one, touching on existential themes like the meaning of life and humanizing those on the other side of war. It works, for the most part, due to a couple of bonkers plot twist and well-done voice acting that helps sell the more outlandish bits of allegory.   Like its predecessors Nier and Drakengard, Automata does have an unfortunate tendency to wander into uber-convoluted territory, and this is where problems start to arise. Try as I might, I couldn’t always understand what was happening,  even after I played through several of Automata’s multiple endings. There are also some emotional moments that struck me as forced. It's as if the game's lead writer Yoko Taro wanted to make me cry and was casting about for ways to make that happen. (To be fair, one event did have me pretty darn misty-eyed.)  I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier. “ The bigger issue was the disconnect I felt from 2B and her fellow androids. Their personal dramas take too long to unwind, which prevented me from fully investing in their fates. Why should I weep or cheer for them if I’m not given a reason until 20 hours in? With that said, I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier pop up to help clarify the connection between it and Automata. Their presence brought about a welcome sense of nostalgia and helped bring closure to Nier: Gestalt's open-ended finale.  I didn’t feel much of a rapport with the heroes, but I definitely enjoyed playing as them. There’s an incredible sense of freedom that comes with effortlessly surfing sand dunes in the desert and shimmying up the concrete remains of office buildings in Automata’s open world. Parkouring plays a big role here, and it’s highly enjoyable thanks to ultra-fluid controls and a very smart camera that effortlessly tracks the action no matter how insane things get. And things get pretty nuts: Automata’s different flavors of combat are a maniacal, supersonic affair, and a total blast to play.   Automata is described as an action RPG, but it’s really an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of game. In between hearty chunks of feel-good hack-and-slash, you’ll trade a fireworks display worth of projectiles with flying enemies, hack into robot mainframes, read a text adventure or two, and even brawl with a pair of psychotic twins. This radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride, and I mean that literally: in one of the craziest, most beautiful action sequences I’ve ever encountered, you’ll fight atop a moving roller coaster while racing full speed through the dilapidated remains of a sun-kissed boardwalk. The radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride. “  The majority of enemy encounters take place on the ground, in sun-dappled pine forests and submerged cityscapes. These seamlessly connected areas offer plenty of space to experiment with Automata’s excellent free-flowing combat, which is where the gameplay shines best and brightest. The system is streamlined into a variety of light and heavy attacks that make it easy to leap, shoot, hack, and slash through giant metal serpents and giant arm-flailing bipeds whose hard knocks can only be avoided through quick thinking and nimble dexterity.   There’s no stamina bar holding you back, and the ability to instantly swap out weapons with a light tap of the D-pad means you can go nuts stringing together long attack combos without the need to stop and catch your breath. Developer Platinum does an amazing job of delivering a seamless combat experience, which becomes all the more impressive as things get increasingly frenzied and you find yourself backspringing away from an angry mob in one direction while charging an oncoming panzer controlled by zombie clowns in the other direction.  Accompanying all the action are hyper-stylized animations of Automata’s cybernetic heroes twirling oversized katanas over their heads and using axes to cut through hostile bits of iron with ballet-like precision. Each battle stance flows elegantly into the next, resembling a crazed version of tai-chi that makes the carnage as fun to watch as it is to play. In fact, combat is such an addicting experience that I often sought out evil animatronics even when they weren’t in my path, just so I could cut them down with a broadsword so massive that in reality it would take three very strong men to lift it.  Automata loves to throw out increasingly zany combat scenarios: it’s not unusual to be fighting in an arena full of robotic samurai, tanks, flying metal spheres, and whatever else it can think of to throw at you. Managing all this insanity requires changing tactics on the fly, which is where Automata’s flexible customization system makes itself handy. Upgradable plug-in chips can be swapped out and freely stacked to adjust your androids’ speed, strength, and defenses at any time. Foraging for nuts and bolts in the wild allows you to upgrade your weapons and AI battle pods, while consuming temporary buff and debuffs help to give you a leg up in battle, particularly during Automata’s more punishing difficulty modes. You can even remove chips that provide HUD information for more of a challenge.   Ticking up the difficulty to white-knuckle levels of chaos was a rewarding way to test my combat skills, but it also meant raising the danger in corpse runs, which greatly increased the possibility of losing precious inventory if I failed to retrieve my body. Luckily, if I ever felt cornered I could just hop online and recruit the AI-controlled remains of another player to fight alongside me, or pilfer them for useful items. And if that didn’t work, I could press a self-destruct button to do massive damage to the enemy (and my clothes). I could even wrest control of an opponent’s mind by hacking into their system and force them to demolish their own allies. Unconventional battle tactics? Yup, but they sure are effective. There’s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth. “  Combat is the heart and soul of Automata, but there’s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth. Fun money-making enterprises like fishing and hunting are available, and I’m very happy to report that the animal-riding mechanics of the original Nier – complete with car-like drifting capabilities – return. There are also a number escort missions and fetch quests you can do on the side. These missions aren’t always exciting, but they help fill in backstory and reward you with money and rare loot upon completion.  My favorite moments, however, were the ones I made up myself. More than once I stopped the action to scale the far-reaching heights of an office building and drink in the sunset, or stood atop a massive tree limb to survey the land below me. These quiet, zen-like moments were a welcome reprieve between bouts of overcaffeinated combat. I loved it, and I loved the game for allowing me to do it.   At this point I should note that you do need to wait for Automata to fully download before you play it, otherwise there’s a high probability of coming across a game-breaking bug about three hours in. I also crashed out twice during a couple of particularly intense boss fights, which was a pain in the butt since there's no auto-save and I had to start the battles over again. Still, spread out over 30 hours of gameplay that’s not the worst thing in the world.",

        "Content": "Simply looking out over its gorgeous vistas and up at its gnarly monster designs was enough to sell a curious dungeon diver like myself on Ravenbound. But as much as that first impression made me want to love this 3D roguelike, turbulence threw this bird far off course soon after taking flight. What starts as a promising action game eventually had me flying against a torrent of obscure and regressive systems, a flurry of frustratingly uncontrollable loot randomness, and a storm of very annoying bugs that quickly grounded any hopes I had for it. As The Raven, a weapon made by the old imprisoned gods of the world of Ávalt, you’ll possess a randomly generated character called a vessel on each new run.  Every vessel has a different mix of mostly mediocre traits, weapon specialties, and even racial bonuses, but they’ll all inherit your own persistent ability to soar across the sky as a magic bird and absorb power from the foes you defeat in combat. You’ll wander the vast and boring stretches of this open world’s five beautiful regions, dropping in on enemy camps, killing everyone in sight, and collecting items as part of an aggravating card-based loot system until you’re strong enough to slay the betrayer god who doomed this world.. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Combat isn’t complex, but it can be fun. Each of the five weapon types have unique properties you’ll start to notice after playing with them a bunch, though I wish they were explained more clearly from the start. Greataxes and the sword and shield are good for staggering, while greatswords have a wide swing that's good for clearing crowds. With only a couple of combos for each, successful hacking and slashing comes down to mastering the satisfying dodge and parry systems, both of which give powerful combat buffs when executed precisely. In addition to helping you avoid damage, well-timed dodges put you in a frenzied state that supercharges your attack speed, while perfect parries can knock enemies down. The rewards for getting good at these techniques are well worth the risks, and are essential for taking down late game enemies and bosses. That said, there's so much about the systems that interface with combat that feels obtuse. Keywords tied to buffs, debuffs, and abilities can sometimes be straightforward like staggering enemies or bleeding, but others are far less obvious and occasionally not even defined in the codex. After the 15-plus hours it took me to beat the main story the first time, I still have no idea what a multistrike is, or what the Luck stat does. Enemies, who are at least plentiful and come in all shapes and sizes like little goblin-like soldiers, hulking ogres, and shifty tree spirts, have both standard and elite forms. The elites have modifiers denoted by a title like Juggernaut or Crusher, but again, it's not very clear what the difference between them is. Discovering new mechanics and abilities for yourself is a staple of the soulslike genre, but there’s a line between nudging you to test your strength against mysterious opponents to reach an “a ha!” moment and being frustratingly opaque that Ravenbound is does not walk well. Bugs drag down moments where I might otherwise be having fun. “ The Warden bosses at the end of every region are tough tests of your item builds and endurance as they relentlessly attack with long combos leaving very small windows for counterattack. Though they all come in the same form, a knight wielding one of the weapon types available to you, each one is a frantic back and forth fight. These challenges can be fun… when they aren’t suffering from some of Ravenbound’s most pernicious bugs, like one that doesn’t track boss health accurately. The life bar will frequently freeze in place, and even though numbers are registering with strikes, that damage may not be visible for several blows. This doesn’t make the bosses unkillable, but it does make having any idea of your progress against them impossible. That’s also just one of many bugs plaguing Ravenbound. Audio tracks overlap with each other, or just cut out entirely; NPCs and shopkeepers occasionally vanish; I’ve had about a half-dozen crashes, which are annoying even if the auto saving is diligent enough that I never lost progress because of it. None of these are game breaking issues, but the sum of them does drag down the moments where I might otherwise be having fun. Loaded Deck Ravenbound may be a roguelike with a card-based progression system, but this is by no means a deckbuilder in the way something like Slay the Spire is. Instead, it uses collectible card game motifs to house otherwise familiar systems in ways that are hit and miss. Everything you could potentially find or earn during a given run is a card in your “deck,” be that gear like a suit of armor that makes enemies bleed when they hit you or buffs that do things like increase your weapon’s attack power. Every time you would gain one of these things, you “draw” your choice of one of three cards from the larger deck to see what it will be, and it then sits in your “hand” until you spend a resource called mana to activate or equip it. I liked that this meant I could hold onto something that might be useful in the future even if I couldn’t use it right now, making finding new loot a little less all-or-nothing than some other roguelikes. However, the lack of any actual deck building mechanics within this card system is a big issue. With no way to curate or guide the randomness of the cards in your deck to help you draw toward a more consistent result, I felt like I was at the mercy of the cruel RNG Gods every run. Even Ravenbound’s persistent progression systems that reward you for achieving in-game feats, like killing a certain amount of a monster with a particular weapon, just add more items to the overall pool. These are better, cooler items – like a sword that curses everything you strike with it – but they also mean the probability of seeing any specific one only ever gets lower. I wish I could better influence what was in my deck. “ There are at least a decent handful of ways to earn item draws mid-run. Straight up buying them from vendors, who sell a randomized selection of items or provide chances to draw from pools of specific item types, is the safest way, but it costs gold which you’ll need to earn by clearing camps full of monsters. Alternatively, the elite monsters in camps drop fragments, collecting three of which allows you to draw three cards from your deck and add one of them to your hand. These monsters are also often guarding treasure chests, which you can open to get your hands on some loot. There are a lot of opportunities to draw cards, and even though none of them come without a cost (be that literal money or a fight to overcome), I always felt like I had opportunities to take another spin of the wheel – I just wish I could better influence what was on it. I often chose not to spin that wheel at all thanks to the hatred mechanic. Whenever you open a chest or attempt to collect items from other players' graves who died in your area in their own games, a card on your next draw is replaced with one that automatically buffs every elite and boss monster in the region for the rest of your run. Every time you combine fragments, a three-piece bar in the bottom-right corner fills up a little more. When one of the sections is filled up entirely, it will similarly turn one of your next card draws into a boss buff until you kill the boss of the particular region you are in. These enemy buffs can really add up, and make every draw more and more risky – sometimes disproportionately, so since there's no way to guarantee that the next card you draw is even useful, let alone good, after fighting increasingly harder enemies for it. Do you like card systems in action games? Yes! No! It depends on how it's used I don't care Answer See Results There’s an early reprieve for this built into the main quest. When you first enter each of the five regions, a rift is marked on your map. Traveling across these beautiful forests, arid deserts, or dank marshes to get to them (either on foot with the aid of a grappling hook or by switching into the form of the eponymous raven by hopping on top of special altars), these rifts present you with an opportunity to cleanse a handful of nearby chests of their hatred while scoring a good amount of mana in the process. Taking down the rifts guardians, and then plundering the newly clean treasure for “free” helps get you off to the races, but I found that if I didn’t get a solid weapon, armor, or key relic for a strong build out of this initial haul, then I was likely better off just re-rolling a new character than attempting to wing it for the next hour. If you follow the main quest markers, you’ll spend very little time in each region outside of clearing rifts and fighting world bosses. There’s a side quest for each section, but that involves traveling to a lifeless city, talking to wooden NPCs, and taking on a task that is just some version of killing a target with the added frills of a completely ignorable motivation from a throwaway character. As an open world game, you’re free to explore on your own, but there isn’t a huge reason to do so very thoroughly. As enticing as the well-designed ruins of old forts or mysterious mining caves are, there is often no prize in them worth the trouble that you couldn’t also find just dropping in on any random camp on the surface. This is a hugely disappointing use of Ravenbound’s beautiful, Scandinavian folklore inspired environments.",

        "Content": "The common thread that ties all extreme sports together is the fragility of life. People die wingsuit diving, rock climbing, and skiing all the time -- but that's part of the appeal. Taking part in these activities is shaking hands with the Grim Reaper and acknowledging this could be the last ride. So when Ubisoft took these activities and packaged them into a harmless Kinect game, the appeal doesn't follow suit. MotionSports Adrenaline takes some bad ass activities and manages to remove the tension, fear, and excitement that make them worthwhile.  MotionSports Adrenaline features six of \"the world's most dangerous sports!\" These include Wingsuit Diving, Kitesurfing, Rock Climbing, Mountain Biking, Kayaking, and Skiing. Each activity puts players behind the controls of various death-devices where they collect tokens, dodge obstacles, and perform tricks for additional points. When I say obstacles, I don't mean the certain death that would come with really hitting obstacles during these activities, I just mean minor inconveniences that vaguely change finish times, like careening into a mountain peak while wingsuit diving; you know, harmless little trifles.   Wingsuit diving is exciting, but you won't get that from MotionSports Adrenaline.  This lack of effective danger completely undermines what extreme sports are all about. You can hit a tree skiing, smash into a seaside cliff while kitesurfing, or completely lose your grip while mountain climbing to the tune of a few lost seconds. Shouldn't a terrible collision cause some form of restarting the race or jumping back to a checkpoint? MotionSports Adrenaline is all about death-denying feats of non-bravery. Where's the adrenaline in that?  But of course it's a game; you are the controller and there's no lasting danger. Thus it's not entirely the lack of consequence that ends up pushing MotionSports Adrenaline off the quality cliff, it's the poor gesture recognition. Most of the activities involve some form of tilting handlebars, paddles, or poles side to side, ducking to boost, and holding poses to do tricks. But regardless of how dramatically one swings into the pose, Motionsports Adrenaline delays reading it and often misses what you're doing entirely.  Forget about slight adjustments to the direction you're racing in, it's all or nothing in most events. Mountain Biking takes place on a three-lane dirt road. By moving your hands as though they're on handlebars, you can cut from lane to lane. But when trying to nab a few tokens in the middle lane, I had trouble getting Kinect to read my slight adjustments, and always slipped into the far lane rather than the desired lane. Precision was an ongoing problem across all events.   Events like mountain biking have issues with precision.  MotionSports Adrenaline really fizzles out when it comes to multiplayer. Where the potential for great competition lives inside the premise, the execution completely falls apart. While playing Adrenaline Party with multiple friends, some events require a relay-style hand-off of the controls. To accomplish this, two players must hold the required pose and if successful the race continues on seamlessly. But MotionSports Adrenaline often switches which player is which, so the required poses switch sides of the screen without notice – if they're recognized at all. This element is frustrating to say the least.  And \"racing\" a friend while Rock Climbing simply lacks any fun whatsoever. There's almost no way to get around each other, if the mode can even recognize that you're trying to climb.   Playing multiplayer is a frustrating and unresponsive experience.  The coolest feature in the whole extreme package is challenges. When going through the various levels, a note pops up that shows off how many points a random online player earned through a certain section. Depending on your score, you either beat the challenge, or the stranger defends it. It's a quick way to earn some bonus points along the road to extreme-ness and a nice way to add a bit of challenge.  If its other misgivings aren't already a sign that something went wrong, MotionSports Adrenaline is branded all over with Degree Adrenaline deodorant (for men, sorry ladies). After ponying up the retail price of $49.99, MotionSports Adrenaline still constantly suggests what product you should apply to your pits while undertaking its challenges.",

        "Content": "Perhaps no modern game is more blunt about its influences than Eldest Souls. Despite having a name that would make a copyright lawyer sweat, this overtly FromSoftware-inspired action game manages to establish its own blend of addictive, brutal combat and gorgeous art direction that rivals its 2D and 3D peers. It doesn’t mirror their same sense of exploration, but if a souls-like focused almost exclusively on boss battles sounds great to you, look no further. Eldest Souls’ artistic and narrative influences aren’t so much worn on its sleeve as they are written on a signboard draped around its body. Borrowing heavily from Dark Souls’ infamous intro, it establishes a world where men and gods came into being at the same time, but mortals eventually found themselves subjugated thanks to the machinations of a god named Eksyll. Humanity revolted, caging the gods inside of a massive Citadel, bringing peace to the land...until Eksyll showed up again, committed some heinous experiments on his fellow gods, and brought about the near-extinction of humanity. Now it’s up to one final hero with an oversized obsidian sword to kill every remaining god still dwelling inside the Citadel and sort out the world’s fate. It doesn’t even get close to the lofty heights of Gwyn or Artorias’ fates, and it’s fairly average stuff for dark fantasy lovers, but it’s still entirely serviceable for what we’re here for: big, beefy boss battles. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Praise the fun Switching influences, Eldest Souls’ combat takes more inspiration from Bloodborne than it does Dark Souls, with a quicker pace and emphasis on aggression. With your giant obsidian sword, you can use a basic swing, a dash, a charge attack, and a powerful “bloodburst” attack that drains your charge. There are no enemies to fight outside of its 10 bosses, so you’re never more than a few hits from death. To that end, Eldest Souls very much encourages an in-your-face play style, with charged and bloodburst attacks replenishing small fragments of health, much like Bloodborne. What results is a nearly nonstop dance of dodging and exchanging desperate blows. A skill tree lets you specialize your combat style between three branching options as you progress: Windslide, which focuses on movement and speed, Berserk, which improves your damage output, and Counter, which buffs your defensive options. Equippable “shards” gained from defeated bosses can also give you extra abilities or buffs depending on how you slot them for further customization. Mercifully, you can completely respec your character any time between fights. I loved this freedom because it consistently surprised me with what combinations were viable. Eldest Souls' boss rush is designed to be played through multiple times. “ Going up against Hyem, a frostbitten armored warrior with the power to slow my dashing, I found myself suiting up with a defensive ability that spawned swords of light with each bloodburst attack. Those swords later shattered upon a successful counter, briefly tripling damage and providing me a moment of solace in the chaos. While fighting the feral Deer God, who attacks with lightning-fast swipes and poisonous roots, I instead respec’d to give myself increased speed to keep up with his great strides across the arena, while flaming leaves I spawned chased him down for guaranteed chipdamage. Infusing boss shards into different slots can prove to be an interesting game of risk vs. reward too, like a special attack that deals extra damage but also hurts you if you’re over 50% health, but heals if you’re under 50%. With such interesting tricks to try, it’s a bit of a shame that Eldest Souls can be stingy with its skill points at first. The story is designed to be played through multiple times, with a New Game Plus and Arena mode for those who want it. But on a first playthrough, which took me about 15 hours overall, that focus on replayability means fighting some of the early bosses were slightly less enthralling without a wide array of abilities at my disposal. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images That said, these fights are all impeccably balanced, threading a fine line between frustrating and devilishly tantalizing. The number of times I came within a millimeter of death, only to climb my way back with careful strikes, desperate healing, and mashing the square button made the victories even sweeter. I died 519 times to Eldest Souls’ bosses, but even when it spurred me to yell obscenities across the living room, I immediately wanted to hop back in for another try. And thankfully it makes doing so a painless process, with quick respawn load times, and even choosing the “give up” option to take a breather only requiring a short walk back to the boss’ arena. Pixel-Perfect Punching Bag With only 10 bosses, I was worried Eldest Souls would be a light meal, but each one and their accompanying arenas are imbued with enough creativity to make every fight feel like the spectacle it needs to be. The excellent pixel art style results in some fascinating animations, selling the corruption of a massive knight as dozens of tendrils spring from his arms, or when an ancient god of light wearily stands up from his throne of massive electrical cables. Its art is equally important in battle, where an emphasis is placed on learning a boss’ tells in order to better dodge and exploit openings. If there’s a complaint to be made, it’s that the isometric 2D format and pixel art style can sometimes result in boss attacks being a little less clear than they would be in a 3D action game. An early example is while fighting the Guardian, a corrupted god who very much evokes Demon’s Souls’ Tower Knight. His hulking frame shambles beautifully, but he turns on a dime so quickly, with nary an in-between animation frame, that it often resulted in me eating an unexpected face full of spear. Which is the best FromSoftware Soulsborne game? Demon's Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls 3 Bloodborne Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Answer See Results But the generally fantastic art direction extends throughout the Citadel itself too, which contains a number of beautifully diverse biomes to briefly venture through before the next boss. Embers float through shattered battlefields and down dusty streets, while crystal-clear lakes slowly churn the bodies of long-dead soldiers. A path guarded with laser-shooting stones is littered with the charred remains of more soldiers, stuck in mangled poses that betray how horribly they perished. It’s easily some of the best pixel art ever committed to a video game, rivaled only by the likes of Hyper Light Drifter or Dead Cells . Just don’t go in expecting a very long journey through these environments. While undoubtedly beautiful, each area is pretty small, and will really only take you a minute or so to get around. The emphasis is absolutely on the bosses here, but the world is filled with enough detail worth stopping to admire from time to time. The small number of NPCs – like a melancholic bard, a traumatized blacksmith, or a vengeful skull made of ice – all provide some fun flavor, even if Eldest Souls doesn’t reach anywhere near the admittedly high bar of world-building that its FromSoft inspirations are known for. What I did appreciate, however, was the fragmented storytelling that often came with defeating a boss, when some aspect of its true nature was revealed. Some are quietly tragic, while others are flat out gross in the best way possible.",

Real Racing 2's tilt controls are spot-on. Now, you may get a little frustrated during your first few races due to a propensity to over-correct on turns that cause race-losing spinouts. But that's not the fault of the controls. You just need to be a bit smoother about applying the brakes (I turned off brake assist right away to get the most out of corners) and pour some race winnings into improving the handling on your car. Might I suggest some new tires?  In fact, much of Real Racing 2's excellence is in its ability to make every vehicle upgrade count. At first, I was feeling good if I came in fifth. But plugging through early events a few times to bankroll upgrades makes a real difference. By the end of the first cup (there are several cups, which include a series of challenges and events) I had earned enough coin to upgrade every facet of my little VW. With this improved vehicle, I enjoyed diving back into earlier events and cruising to victory. I used those winnings to buy new cars (hello, 370Z) which were much more aggressive beasts. With every ride offering different but manageable handling, Real Racing 2 feels like it's constantly evolving under your fingertips.   iPad 2 view of Real Racing 2 HD  Even though Real Racing 2 is a simulation racer – if you want to shoot missiles and drop oil slicks, look elsewhere – it isn't a cruel mistress. With an upgraded ride, mistakes don't cost you the entire race. However, you have to get those upgraded cars to enjoy that leniency. When you first dive into a new cup and go fender-to-fender with Real Racing 2's aggressive rivals, a bad turn can cost you six or seven spaces in the race. But stick to it. So much of Real Racing 2's fun is getting to a place where you can go back to earlier events that brutalized you and then turn the tables.  Real Racing 2 offers online multiplayer via Game Center. Up to sixteen racers can queue up at the starting line. It makes for a thrill ride, as there is something about trading paint with another person – somebody you can psych out – that is just better than racing against a series of cold calculations. Some of the framerate issues from the single-player game pop up a little more online, as does the occasional bout of lag. Neither of these ruins playing Real Racing 2 online, but they are noticeable. Real Racing 2 also includes local multiplayer via WiFi. ",

        "Content": "I'm always immediately taken by a game that wholeheartedly embraces its Japanese origin. When a Japanese title is released here in the United States, it's always disappointing (though somewhat understandable) to see it brutally Americanized for a mainstream audience. Fortunately, Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble , a wonderfully quirky brawler published by Atlus , is a game that's not only entirely Japanese, but carefully localized to wholly preserve its unique aesthetic. This is an over-the-top and funny game that anime fans and the like could really get into.  The problem is that Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble's gameplay tends to be awkward and the overall presentation is bland. It's a shame, really, because the style and premise of Badass Rumble is fantastic, but the rest of the package fails to provide the smooth brawling experience that has been brilliantly executed countless times before it.   Takashi is a badass, no doubt.  Before we examine Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble at length, it might be worthwhile to explain the game's title. \"Kenka\" essentially means \"fighting\" in Japanese, while a \"bancho\" is a tough guy or badass type. Hopefully you already know what \"Badass Rumble\" means, as that part of the title is in English...  In Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble, players take control of a rough-around-the-edges high school student who finds himself on a week-long school trip to the historic city of Kyouto. While the main purpose of the trip is supposed to be educational and fun, our hero -- named Takashi by default -- is much more interested in being the No. 1 bancho in Japan. As banchos from all across the country (one from each of Japan's prefectures) are staying in the city, Takashi plans on fighting them all and dominating the bancho universe.  Although Takashi is an unruly character, he obviously has a soft spot for some of his classmates (especially the token cute friend) and he follows the bancho code of honor well. This demonstrates one of the strongest aspects of Badass Rumble: the premise. Playing a total badass who wanders through a Japanese city, conquering different territories while also maintaining relationships with several lovely female characters is a great time. The structure of the game is also quite sim-like and will definitely appeal to gamers interested in Japanese high school simulations.  Each day of your single vacation week is divided into three sections: the morning (which runs from 9:00 to 13:00), the afternoon (which runs from 13:00 to 19:00), and then the evening (which is the final hour of the day). As you run around the open city of Kyouto, which is divided into different areas, time passes at about a minute every couple of seconds. Triggering certain story events will also move time forward, but players should have plenty of time to go about their business in the city.   Combo customization is one of the highlights of the experience.  Although the sim elements do occupy a fair portion of the gameplay landscape, the brawling is what Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble is all about. It is here that I was disappointed with the game, because Badass Rumble just feels clunky. Techniques are slow to execute, movement is stiff and the controls take some serious getting used to. This is definitely an unfortunate flaw in the game's design, as the rest of it is very enjoyable, despite the somewhat bland feel of the city.  The combat system in Badass Rumble is just a bit more complex than a standard brawler. Before you even start a fight with a local baddie, you need to \"cut a Menchi\" at him. This involves shooting him in the face with your laser eyes. This is not a joke. Once you have engaged in this epic laser battle, you'll then square-off in a game of insults where you must construct a badass phrase out of several onscreen key words. For example, something like \"Cry to your momma!\" will appear on screen. Quickly memorize it, and then find each segment of the phrase in the following bubbles of text. It gets old after a while, but by the end of the game this system gets much more challenging.    Once you actually get to the fighting, you have your standard light and fierce attacks, as well as some grapples and charge attacks to take advantage of. Players can lock on to nearby enemies to make the carnage a little more manageable, but mainly you'll be following a pattern of executing a combo, grabbing your opponent, throwing him, pinning him for a few extra hits and then waiting for the next attack. The different attack types certainly keep things interesting, but again the battles feel so stiff it's hard to fully enjoy the systems in place.  As you level up in Badass Rumble, players will learn more moves and acquire different \"Local Specialties\" from each of the defeated banchos (there are more than 40 main banchos from across Japan to beat, besides the generic cookie cutter enemies). When Takashi is in his room at the inn, you can fully customize his move set and even change the flow of his three-hit combo. These techniques can also be adjusted while Takashi takes a form of public transportation around the city. This is all great stuff and would have been extremely exciting had the combat not felt so stiff and inorganic. Even the two-player Ad Hoc multiplayer does little to alleviate these issues.  I really enjoyed the ability to customize Takashi's appearance, as there is a clothing store and barber shop in Kyouto that players can access at any time. These changes to Takashi's appearance are then reflected in the game's cutscenes, which can lead to some humorous situations. Even better: you can take pictures during cutscenes and proper gameplay and save them in an album to view later. This feature is irrelevant in terms of gameplay but it's a nice option to have.   If only the brawling could have been more fluid...  Besides the less-than-ideal combat, I do have a few other complaints to level at Badass Rumble. The first: where is the music and ambient sound when you walk through the city?! It's terribly awkward to be strolling down a busy city street and not hear any chatter or sound effects besides your own footsteps. Couple that with a complete absence of music and you have a vapid Kyouto. Fortunately, music does play during battles and cutscenes (And it's good, too!), but I would have liked to see more of it to keep the in-game environments from feeling lifeless.  Lastly, I would have appreciated a few more in-game tutorials that describe the structure of the Badass Rumble experience. As soon as you leave the inn, you're given very little instruction on what to do next. This is a game that actually has a very helpful instruction manual, so consider peeking at it before playing.",

        "Content": "Unsurprisingly, Dead Rising 3: Apocalypse Edition on PC is a lot like when I reviewed Dead Rising 3 on Xbox One nine months ago, so be sure to check out that review for an in-depth look at how everything works. The short version is that smashing huge hordes of zombies into goo with ridiculous home-made weapons - such as a sledge hammer with a cement saw tied to it or a toy robot bear with a light machine gun - or driving through them with a flame-throwing steamroller/motorcycle hybrid is, as ever, absolutely madness. It's even better when you bring in a friend in co-op, and the two of you compete to see who can wear the most idiotic outfit.   Watch the original Dead Rising 3 review here. All of that is the same in the new PC version, which includes the four Untold Stories of Los Perdidos DLC episodes but not the goofier Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha. The biggest difference is that it's noticeably better looking, thanks to the ability to run at full 1920x1080 resolution and, if you make a simple tweak to an .ini file in the Dead Rising 3 directory, can run with an uncapped frame rate. (Create a text file and rename it to “user.ini”, then paste in: “gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True” with no quotes. Place it in the same folder as deadrising3.exe before running the game.) It's strange that there's no menu option to remove the default 30fps cap, though, and you probably shouldn't expect to get a full, steady 60fps unless you're running at medium settings - even my Core i5-4670K and GeForce GTX 780 weren't capable of sustaining it with maxed-out settings when in the midst of a horde. I also noticed a bit of pop-in on certain objects, which carries over from the Xbox One version. Dead Rising 3 will never be the prettiest of games, but it's a damn fun one. I played mostly on mouse and keyboard, though an Xbox 360 gamepad is naturally supported. Controls are definitely usable - I did a little remapping from defaults - but there's some weirdness. Restrictions on how far you can move the camera to look up and a complete disconnect between which way the camera's facing and which way you're moving both caused some slight frustration - nothing I couldn't get used to, though.",

        "Content": "Altered Beast never was a very good game. Those of us that eagerly looked forward the Genesis convinced ourselves that it was a genius port of an incredible arcade game, but time has not been kind to this simplistic, often clunky, action game.  You are a muscle-bound Greek hero that transforms into a wolfman, tigerman, dragonman, and more after collecting three magical orbs. Each creature form has special powers, like shock attacks and fireballs, perfect for taking out the final boss of each stage.  The biggest problem with Altered Beast is that it's only fun when you're a creature. Your human hero is an oaf with limited punching and kicking range, ill-equipped to deal with the beasts and monsters that come from all sides. As you power up your hero, he grows bigger muscles (yet his head stays small, making him look silly) and can supposedly attack faster, but the pace of your attacks and movement just never matches up with the monsters. However, as soon as you are a flying dragon dude or a bear, you have the run of the board. Only the boss of the stage presents a challenge.  Altered Beast includes Bluetooth multiplayer so two ripped heroes can vie for magical orbs (by kicking blue oxen, of course) and beat back the monsters. This is a nice addition and makes Altered Beast a touch more fun.  SEGA's Genesis emulation has certainly evolved over the last several months. Early ports of Sonic and Golden Axe suffered from bad emulation that slowed the action to a crawl, even when little was happening on-screen. Altered Beast is smooth. I do wish, though, that SEGA had ported over the arcade version instead of the Genesis port. It looks so much better. And it's not like it would be a monster download. Hopefully, SEGA will soon begin offering its arcade games as well as the Genesis ports. ",

        "Content": "Nintendo has repeatedly promised that Mario's first 3DS adventure would show off what the system is really made of, cementing it as a truly unique and capable platform. The incredible part? The company actually delivered. 3D gaming has never been fully realized before this.    As the first 3DS title to actually use 3D as an integral part of the gameplay experience, 3D Land's platforming relies heavily on the precision leant by the 3D effect. You can adjust it with a simple touch of the D-pad to either pop out or sink in more, depending on which suits the area best or just which you prefer at the moment. You can play without 3D enabled, but it makes things considerably more difficult and frustrating - this game was designed to be played in 3D, and you can't fully experience it otherwise.  Certain parts of 3D Land, during which a small 3D symbol appears on the top screen, you'll find near impossible to pull off without activating the 3D. By relying on 3D as an important mechanic rather than a second thought to enhance the visuals, the developers achieved the most effective 3D I've ever seen in any medium, as well as the most brilliant use of it. From the clever platforming puzzles to the creative level design, every aspect of the game is heightened by the masterful use of an effect that up until now has essentially only been used as an optional visual boost. As Mario jumps off a bouncy mushroom and soars out of your screen - or pulls off a daring jump onto a tiny platform to nab a secret or hidden medal - it becomes apparent that 3D Land represents the kind of experience the 3DS was always meant for.   Behind you, Mario! BEHIND YOU! The first eight worlds of 3D Land make for an engaging playthrough, though most of them I found relatively easy. While still completely enjoyable and creative - blending old school Mario concepts like Music Blocks and flagpoles with Galaxy innovations like flip switches and timed, disappearing platforms - you'll run through most of these worlds rather quickly. Things really pick up in the difficulty department after defeating World 8. Hardcore gaming enthusiasts should take comfort in the fact that the ease of the first few worlds is most certainly not indicative of the game's overall difficulty level. I've stomped a few Goombas in my day, but some of the later levels still took many, many tries to best.  New mechanics and challenges introduced after World 8 greatly enhance the experience and up the challenge significantly. The level design grows more complex and diverse, drawing creative inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy 2's more difficult trials and applying them to this 2D/3D platforming hybrid in a way that's never been done before. Collecting all three hidden medals in all of the levels will take even the most proficient gamer some thinking and trying to pull off. This progressive difficulty climb, paired with the at times intense medal challenges, make for an addictive and brilliant handheld experience that provides an impressive balance of easy and hard, long levels and short levels, big areas and small ones.  All of the levels, even the easier ones, are truly memorable and instantly classic, just like in the original Super Mario Bros. games. Also like these old gems, you'll find tons of hidden secrets, which you'll stumble across only by chance or by purposefully exploring and jumping around every area. The time limit on each level, which can be extended in some cases by finding and collecting clocks, further adds to the thrill by forcing you to plow forward and not second guess your jumps. While the entire game offers plenty of Mario's trademark platforming bliss, after World 8 the game makes a return to the sharp, clever challenge of the NES days - and it's as thrilling as ever.   Tanooki tails all around! The Power-Ups in the game are also brilliantly balanced, once you figure out how best to use them. The new Boomerang Suit allows Mario to toss a boomerang at his foes, and the Tanooki Tail lets Mario float (much like Yoshi does in Super Mario World 2). If used cleverly, both provide a strategic advantage when surrounded by enemies, and you actually need them for nabbing certain secrets and hidden medals. Learn to throw the boomerang at just the right height and angle and you can take down flying enemies, giving the item an advantage over the Fire Flower. The Tanooki Tail provides a great safety net for less proficient gamers, but even with the ability to float, many of the later levels feature blistering difficulty and make holding onto that coveted tail a challenge. Honestly, the fact that one hit from any enemy takes these powers away - and that you must know how to use them to fully reap their benefits - help make these Power-Ups more a clever tool than a free ride.  The graphics are some of the best on the system - hugely reminiscent in look to Super Mario Galaxy, though applied to shorter, non-planetary levels. The shading is beautiful, and the textures look crisper than anything else you'll find on the system. With creative backgrounds in the levels, Mario 3D Land offers a bright, beautiful world right in the palm of your hand. The level of interactivity with the environment is also stunning. Small touches like hearing the Toads freak out when you spin them with your Tanooki tail or charring the grass with Fire Balls helps connect you with the world and brings the entire presentation to a whole new level.  The incorporation of gyroscope and StreetPass help round out the package, making for the ideal 3DS experience. You can use gyroscope when looking through a set of binoculars in some of the levels, tilting the system to gain a better view of the challenges that lie ahead or to zoom in on a captive Toad - sometimes yielding a 1-Up Mushroom, Power-Up or even a hidden medal. StreetPass allows you to unlock mystery boxes - timed challenge rooms where you must race to collect all of the coins and defeat all of the enemies to grab the medal before time runs out. StreetPassing with other 3DS owners allows you to see their best times on each level, a great way to challenge yourself by trying to beat the times of those you've crossed paths with.",

        "Content": "The first thing we see in Virginia’s opening shot is a woman sliding a key into a locked box. The camera cuts away before we get to see what’s inside, gracefully setting the tone for the haunting, enigmatic tale to follow. What’s most impressive about the interactive story that unfolds across Virginia’s emotionally compelling two hours is the depth of character and absorbing mystery it builds without a single line of dialogue. While there were times I wished I could break away from my limited role in its story, Virginia’s soaring symphonic score and brisk cinematic pace are so dense with drama that I was usually happy to play my part just to get the next piece of this beautifully crafted narrative puzzle. Virginia is full of small, emotionally substantial moments. “ Virginia is told from the perspective of newly minted FBI Agent Anne Tarver, an ambitious rookie plagued by nightmares about her career and a recent loss in the family. Tarver is easily controlled in the first-person, with either a typical keyboard and mouse setup or just the mouse, with left-click to interact and right-click to conveniently walk forward. This is the extent of your control in this interactive story, which essentially has you acting out linear roles in scenes punctuated by clean cinematic cuts. It’s easy to pick up and dive right into, though there’s a strange motion blur effect that my GTX 760 didn’t like, creating some annoying input lag. Reducing settings to medium resolved that (without much sacrifice considering the low-poly art style still looks good on medium settings), as did playing on a GTX 980. But even with the lag, I soon found myself so engrossed by Tarver’s journey to the small town of Kingdom, Virginia that I hardly noticed. On her first day at the FBI, Tarver is partnered up with the secretive, stone-faced Maria Halperin to investigate a missing persons case, but also given a confidential directive from Internal Affairs to monitor Agent Halperin on the side. This sets Tarver and Halperin’s tense partnership into motion, giving every subtle, wordless gesture and awkward interaction between the two an exciting importance. Details carry so much weight that missing a single second can be like skipping an entire cutscene. “ Virginia is full of small, emotionally substantial moments like this; scenes that illustrate the tone of every action through smart body language and music rather than dialogue or exposition. Something as small as a sideways glance speaks volumes, heightening my awareness of its story’s most minute details and demanding my attention in a way that made investigating the tiny, secretive town of Kingdom that much more engaging. The music (performed beautifully by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra) is gorgeous, memorable, and often enough to carry or accompany the emotional weight of a scene in combination with its quieter elements. In one scene, you wander into the dark, cobwebbed hallways of the FBI’s headquarters trying to find Halperin’s office, only to be greeted with an unimpressed glare and the cold shoulder from your strange new partner. Halperin will impatiently switch off the radio in her car if you try to turn it on, and make a prominent display of dining and dashing at a small-town cafe, leaving you, the pitiful rookie, with the bill. But despite her coldness towards you she also has a lot going on inside that makes her more than the cool, uncaring partner — she wears a cherished locket with an unidentified woman’s photo inside, entrusts you with her wedding ring during a mid-week visit to a bar, and lets you crash on her couch after a night of drinking beers on the water tower overlooking the town. In the morning, she cooks you two eggs and herself just one. Watching Tarver and Halperin’s friendship develop under the strain of an unsolved mystery and the looming possibility of your betrayal is one of the more riveting stories I’ve experienced in a game this year. I’m still reflecting on its haunting conclusion a week later. “ Virginia’s nuanced storytelling extends beyond just the relationship between Halperin and Tarver. A stick of lipstick tossed bitterly into the trash, two separate beds in a married couple’s bedroom, a father refusing to hug his son — details carry so much weight that missing a single second can be like skipping an entire cutscene or tearing a page from a book. Every little thing is deliberate and demands contemplation. This all culminates in an emotionally climactic ending that delivers satisfying answers to some questions, but also raises a few new ones, demanding I return to it twice as observant as before. Three complete playthroughs later I find myself still dwelling on even its most unassuming mysteries as I try to fully piece together the latter half of its increasingly surreal story. Multiple playthroughs is easy thanks to Virginia’s brisk pace and option to skip ahead to any one of its 41 chapters. It’s a story you can complete in under two hours if you don’t take it slow, though if you do choose to there are a number of collectable feathers and flowers scattered around certain scenes that give additional incentive to replay. While I had fun collecting them, I found that the frantic pixel-hunting required to track them down felt at odds with the somber tone or carefully crafted flow of most scenes. The story itself is enough of a reward for making a return visit. Despite each scene being very carefully put together and paced out, there were a few times where I wished I’d had just a bit more freedom as Agent Tarver. Left-clicking the right objects or simply navigating to the correct location at the right time moves each scene forward in a strictly linear fashion, similar to interactive stories like Firewatch or Thirty Flights of Loving. This suits its snappier scenes well, where Tarver is fixed in place in a car or sifting through records in an FBI database. Virginia shows instead of tells. “ But in sections without this pre-existing momentum or urgency, where I was given time and space to wander and explore on my own accord, I found myself gravitating to things I couldn’t do anything with. I wanted to put my hand on the shoulder of the mother whose son was missing. I wanted to explore my messy apartment — still full of moving boxes and adorned with beer bottle vases for the flowers I’d collected around town — and see if there was something I could learn about Tarver that wasn’t of immediate importance. In the end, though, my impact or interference in the story Virginia wanted to tell mattered less to me than the beautiful, ambiguous, and haunting conclusion it builds up to, which I’m still left reflecting on almost a week later.",

        "Content": "     Operation Wolf . This Taito-developed shooter, adapted from an arcade source, was originally a Zapper-compatible title when it came to the NES in 1989. So unless you have the peripheral and find yourself using just a controller to play it be warned: No solution was ever introduced to simulate the old NES Zapper, no extra programming or effort was made to make it play more like the way it was originally intended. Unless you're one of the lucky ones who still have the light gun, Operation Wolf is a Zapper game without the Zapper.   Sorry man, no help for you. You're stuck in Operation Wolf. You can still play Operation Wolf, of course, but you're forced to use the D-Pad. Doing so gives you command over an on-screen targeting cursor, which you'll have to sweep back and forth across the screen to line up with the enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters seeking to take you out. It's functional, but it's not any fun.  Because the cursor's movements are imprecise and frustrating at best, and you simply can't move the reticule as quickly and accurately as you need to in order to clear out all the many enemies swarming the screen at once. With the Zapper in hand, all it took was a quick wrist movement to target any position on the screen -- with the cursor, you have to wait for the graphic to travel the full length of the display ever time you move from firing at something on the left to firing at something on the right.  And who even knows what you're firing at? Operation Wolf's 8-bit visuals are horrendous, with muddy, indistinct backgrounds layered behind stiff and lifeless enemy soldiers. Your foes blink with a white light when they're about to fire at you, giving you some time to counterattack before their bullets or grenades hit you in the chest, but good luck keeping yourself alive when five different guys are all set to blinking in different corners of the screen simultaneously.  If you manage to survive and progress from one stage to another, you'll find that Operation Wolf actually does have a workable plotline in place about a band of commandos raiding an enemy concentration camp in World War II and trying to free hostages imprisoned there. But that aspect, as with every other, worked much better in the game's original arcade edition. There you could select which of the game's six stages to play first, and the challenges in other levels were determined by the order in which you tackled previous levels. Here the order is determined and linear right from the beginning, eliminating yet another potential positive point that this game could have had.",

A little luck in the right places and a game can be tense, gripping, and delightfully unpredictable! But let Lady Luck have things all her own way, and suddenly you've got something that feels random, cruel, and maybe even a little mean-spirited. Something like Tharsis.  Watch Justin and Daemon fail at Tharsis above.  Tharsis takes place on a star-crossed mission to Mars where, immediately after the tutorial, the spaceship is shattered by a meteorite, two of the crew are killed, and all the food is destroyed. With a ship falling apart around them, the four surviving astronauts try to patch failing ship modules long enough to reach Mars. It's a good setup, though the interstitial cutscenes will get old fast as the try-fail-repeat patterns of Tharsis begin to take their toll. Cascade of Failure  The resource-allocation aspect of Tharsis its strongest point. “ At the start of each turn, new problems strike different modules of your ship, and if they aren't fixed, they will inflict a different kind of harm on your ship or your crew. A failing flight control system could threaten your ship's hull with three points of damage, and if your hull reaches zero it's game over. On the other hand, a fire in the medical bay might do two points of health damage to every crewmember on board your ship, and as crewmembers die, completing the mission becomes much harder (if not impossible). Just choosing which problem to solve would be hard enough, especially as events carry over from turn to turn if you don't fix them, but there are some other priorities to consider that make the resource-allocation aspect of Tharsis its strongest point.  Watch the Tharsis announcement trailer above.  Each module has unique abilities that can help out your crew and better prepare them for problems down the road. Roll three of a kind in the greenhouse module and you will have food to feed your astronauts, which grants them extra dice with which to solve problems. Roll two of a kind in the medical bay and the astronaut working there will be fully healed. On top of that, a module can't have more than one thing wrong with it at a time, so sometimes it's easier to leave a minor problem in place because something worse might happen if you fix it. All these factors create a lot of satisfying opportunities for planning and prediction, and if Tharsis weren't such a fundamentally sadistic game, it could’ve been a lot of fun to manage all these competing priorities. Tharsis just seems to say, \"You made some good calls, but now you lose.\" “ The problem is that there are times that Tharsis just seems to say, \"You made some good calls, but now you lose.\" I've had quite a few games where things were going surprisingly well: my crew were mostly healthy, my ship's hull was in okay shape, and I only had one minor problem dealing some easily handled damage each turn. Then, at the start of the new turn, Tharsis would toss up a set of unbelievably bad events that instantly dealt enough potential damage to destroy my ship, and then make them almost impossible to fix in time to survive to the next turn… when a new round of disasters would strike and start piling on more harm to my beleaguered crew. Rolling in the Deep Ship  The way you attempt to solve all these problems is by rolling some lovingly animated virtual dice. They make a weighty sound as they roll around on the screen, and move with a slight slow-motion effect that shows them teetering between the number you need and the number that dooms you. Each roll becomes a dramatic event as you wait to see whether disaster or a miracle will strike. The decision-making comes about as you send crew members, each with their own pool of up to five six-sided dice, into modules to repair them. Each malfunction on the ship has a target number, reduced by allocating dice to it. So if the medical bay is starting to fill with smoke and the target number is 22, and your mechanic rolls a five, three, and six, you could reduce that target number all the way down to eight. It’s easy enough to understand. But there's another catch – a final punch to the kidneys from Tharsis. Each problem also creates the potential for bad things to happen on your crew member's roll. An example: I had an event that dealt two points of hull damage each turn, with a target number of 22. Not such a big deal to fix… except that on rolls of four, five, and six my crew members would be injured or their dice destroyed. So you can have multiple events going on at once where full half your dice rolls results in bad things happening, and sometimes it's the good rolls that are the most punishing. In this instance, only rolls that could save me would also doom me. 13 Images Dice, by the way, don't replenish between turns unless you feed your crew, which is pretty hard to do when you have problems breaking out all over your ship. Hard, that is, unless you eat dead (or freshly killed!) crew members, which fully replenishes your dice pool but also freaks out your surviving astronauts. Time… to Die  When things did go well, I felt like I'd gotten lucky rather than I'd done something clever. “ That's why it so often felt like Tharsis was just burying me in unsolvable problems, and all the decisions of the past three or four turns were meaningless because a giant set of \"screw you\"s were on their way the entire time. This also means success are less satisfying. When things did go well, I felt like I'd gotten lucky rather than I'd done something clever. Sometimes terrible things happened and I couldn't do anything about them. Sometimes they didn't, and things were fine without much input required. I could skew the odds a bit, but nowhere near enough to affect what Tharsis' random events did. Any luck-based game will occasionally create moments where defeat feels cruel and arbitrary. I play a lot of wargames on PC and tabletop, and there's nothing worse than watching your best tank get blown sky-high because your opponent hit a one-in-50 shot with a bazooka from halfway across the map. But that's just one event in a system whose outcomes are still mostly the product of decision making.",

        "Content": "Dr. Tenma's son has died. Instead of shedding more tears or seeking out some ladies to procreate with he opted to replace his boy by creating a robot... in black vinyl underpants. We suppose that's what any good futuristic scientist in mourning would do.   Astro Boy , the red-booted, nearly naked artificial child, also found himself inexplicably endowed with a variety of heavy weaponry and advanced technology. Now he can fight to protect the city, or at least initially fight so that he can later talk things into submission. When your son dies and you create a robot replacement, why not put him in jeopardy?   Astro Boy is a third-person action game with many, many problems. Despite featuring a loveable, if freakishly underdressed robot-boy overflowing with sappy emotion that pours out from his gigantic owl-eyes, it also manages to feature a sloppy camera, poor controls, uninteresting gameplay, and a storyline so short and unfulfilling you'll wonder why you even bothered.  At first, the premise behind this one seems almost sublime, at least on paper. There's this character that evolves through the completion of missions, earning new powers and undertaking greater challenges. His first gift is that of flight, which allows him to careen about a futuristic metropolis at his leisure. Add in some lasers and arm cannons and jet-powered feet and a bunch of giant bosses and you have a good mix, right? Sadly, no.   Stop Staring at My Pants! Under this thin facade of greatness lies a sinister, wicked truth... The city Astro Boy feels about as constricting as a large backyard and with little that's interesting. And all these wondrous superpowers we can use to further our incredibly mundane gameplay experience are only delivered in succession to make the beatings of six simplistic bosses possible. The bosses, unfortunately, make up about 90% of the game. There aren't even the in-between brawls, platforming, puzzles, and the other fun elements that we've come to expect from SEGA . At least we get new powers, but we'll never use them unless we're forced to.  The x-ray vision lets Astro see stupid invisible baby with big bomb attached to it. The laser finger lets him hit a multitude of enemies at once, and the blast cannon is for taking down the bigger, badder enemies one at a time. But why bother when just punching and throwing seem to suffice? Progression is absurd. Basically you fly to and fro, beat a boss, fly to and fro, win the game. Each boss should theoretically require more skill to master and more powers to triumph over, but this is not the case. In turn, the game becomes so short, so straightforward, and decidedly invaluable to most players.  As a children's title, and taken strictly from that loveable three-foot high vantage point, Astro Boy has some definite appeal; primarily, the art style that's intentionally simplistic, features a lot of high contrasting color schemes, and vivid imagery replete with authentically animated characters. The story, while maddening to a point that would make the Bananas in Pajamas reel over in undying agony, still offers enough child-appealing nonsense that it could pass as entertainment between dinner, some scheduled spankings, and bedtime.  Unfortunately, voices pulled from the cartoon and a likeable style that was not even the doing of the game's creators don't help an experience without a shred of excitement. Add in an unworkable camera and a confusing flight dynamic and you'll likely find youths more confounded than elated. Should you endeavor to hand this over to junior, perhaps as it was intended to be (it's impossible to say for sure), first ponder this: Should you?",

        "Content": "So it took something like seven years for a good Nicktoon like Invader Zim to make it into a video game, but El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera hits shelves a mere nine months after it premieres? It seems like a crime that the good shows are shunned while the new ones are over-marketed. It's also a crime that Barking Lizards developed a game that is so barebones that it feels like the video game equivalent of those Tijuana Rolex ripoffs.  Manny Rivera is a 13-year-old boy living in Miracle City, Mexico. Manny can transform himself into El Tigre with his magical belt buckle. Young Manny is constantly torn between the forces of good and evil due to a rather odd family dynamic. His father is the famous superhero, White Pantera, and his grandpapi is the villainous Puma Loco. They constantly try to pull him one way or the other.  This dichotomy is the basis for how the game is played. Based on how Manny acts, he'll lean more towards the good or bad side. At first this doesn't matter much, but eventually Manny learns special moves that can only be used when he's either good or evil. This is a strong theme of the show, and it's good the developers put it in. In fact, the game matches the show very well. The visual style, while certainly not impressive, is exactly like the simplistic style of the series. Many of the show's infamous villains are present too, so fans of El Tigre will be pleased with the presentation.  The idea of good vs. evil Manny is neat, and matches with the theme of the series, but it's just not pulled off very well. Fighting bad guys fills up Manny's good side, while destroying objects makes Manny evil. The problem is the player doesn't have much control over anything. Enemies have to be destroyed, the game won't progress until they are. Likewise, there are so many enemies on the screen that any object that is destroyable will like be demolished in the process of taking the bad guys out. If players want to try to stay on one path or the other the game becomes complicated, and sometimes it's impossible to not become good during things like boss battles. It's a cool idea, but it's just not plausible with the way things are set up.   Tijuana Tornado sounds like an illness you get after drinking the water down there. El Tigre doesn't have much else going for it either. The game is a very straightforward action platformer. Manny runs, jumps, and punches. There is only one attack button, and the combo system is indistinguishable, so El Tigre becomes a button masher pretty early on. It's fun at first, but it get's a little tedious. There's nothing else to it. No puzzles to solve, no minigames, nothing. Even the boss battles are extremely basic. Perhaps the developers were trying to keep it simple for the target audience, but the experience gets boring fast. Kids like variety, and this game has none.  Kids also like good collision detection. Half the time Manny won't even hit the enemy because the character sprite has walked behind him and it doesn't register hits. But Manny can still get hit. This leads to a lot of deaths in later levels when dozens of bad guys rush the player. Luckily there are infinite lives and players just pick up right where they left off, even in boss battles.  Problem is that takes away any challenge whatsoever. The game can be beat in a couple hours because all players have to do is mash on the A button until everyone dies. There's no reason to dodge attacks or try and survive unless they want to use the special moves that build up when defeating enemies. But chances are the novelty of slashing the stylus in a line to make Manny kick will wear off by level two.",

        "Content": "I like Koth Vortena. He's an NPC companion of mine in Star Wars: The Old Republic's new Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion, and he challenges my beliefs by convincingly expressing admiration for a man I have every reason to hate. He also makes a good point when he yells out as we fight together on distant planets, blasters firing and lightsabers whooming through troopers like butter: \"Wouldn't mind a challenge now and then!\" I feel you, Koth. These moments highlight the curious split in Knights of the Fallen Empire: on the one hand, the story's never been better, and it's filled with nuanced figures like Koth who break from the comical polarizing of good and bad choices BioWare's games are known for. On the other hand, Koth's repeated remark seemingly calls attention to the expansion's laughably easy combat, as it shuttles us through around 10 hours of content without the slightest pretense of challenge. The Story is Strong With This One... That Fallen Empire places such a heavy emphasis on story isn't much of a surprise in itself. After all, good yarns have always been what set SWTOR (and its legendary predecessor, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic) apart from its competition, but this expansion takes it to a whole new level. The nine available story chapters (short though they are) show BioWare in top form, and its emphasis on bringing factions together strongly suggests some good inspiration from Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights of the Fallen Empire kicks off as the hero follows the missing  former Sith emperor to where he's apparently been moonlighting as the emperor of another empire far, far away. Five years pass in which that so-called \"Eternal Empire\" takes over the old Republic and Empire. Naturally it's your job to save them all after a carbonite-enhanced vacation, but not without meaningful plot twists, surprising deaths, Sith and Jedi romancing together — mass hysteria! The characterization involved has never been finer, and the ensuing hours are filled with companion NPCs who don't fit into the cozy delineations of light and dark sides — they're more like regular people. The only two exceptions are the two children of Emperor Valkorian, who come off as sadistic and petulant brats, but it rarely matters since the main plot wisely keeps them at a distance. It's good stuff, and BioWare smartly lets new or returning players create a brand-new level 60 character so they can enjoy the story immediately. The characterization involved has never been finer. “ The approach isn't without some sacrifices, and some of them would have had us screaming that BioWare had changed the fundamental nature of SWTOR just three years ago. Pushed off the stage, for instance, are the lovingly crafted stories for each individual class; nowadays, everyone experiences the same story past 60 regardless of whether they wield a blaster or a lightsaber. Sometimes the new direction clashes violently with the old one, particularly in the way the beautiful, semi-realistic models for Knights of the Fallen Empire's NPC cast make the elongated models of player characters look as though they stepped out of a poorly rendered El Greco painting. They clash further with the lovely new planets the heroes venture through, and they're light years from the technical fireworks BioWare shows off in the expansion's introductory trailer, which looks at least as good as anything I've seen from the footage for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Your Powers Are Weak, Old Man It's all well and good that story is king here, but the problem with Knights of the Fallen Empire is that BioWare pushes it toward despotism. It's so focused on attracting new players to a legitimately good new Star Wars story (conveniently ahead of the upcoming movie) that it makes combat so easy that it's insulting. I'm normally the kind of guy who reads forum threads in search of the merits of this or that build, but I never bothered in Knights of the Fallen Empire. I barely bothered with the layout of my hotkeys. Mash some buttons, any buttons, and you should get through fine. Ability rotations? Ha! I understand the reasoning behind the new focus on single-player gameplay. Star Wars: The Old Republic's MMORPG elements were never as good as they could have been, and the way the new story anchors you to what's essentially one long story instance for five levels precludes any need to play with friends. But I still fondly remember learning to play well in order to defeat some tough single-player bosses back in 2011 and 2012; here, there's none of that. If BioWare wanted to minimize the challenge so completely, perhaps it would have been better off teaming up with Telltale. As it is, I can't imagine anyone truly finds the new combat fun; for me, it's exasperating after a mere hour. I kept wanting to feel some kind of excitement over seeing yet another group of troopers ready to feel the wrath of my lightsaber, but the ease with which they fell over made them mere speed bumps on my way to the next the next cutscene. It doesn't help that many of Star Wars: The Old Republic's old bugbears still remain, such as linear corridors that discourage exploration and the way most enemies stand around patiently in hallways waiting for you to beat them up. (Somehow, mysteriously, performance on my PC is awful relative to other MMORPGs all these years later, too.) As it is, I can't imagine anyone truly finds the new combat fun. “ Much of this ease springs from the changes to companions. KotFE's great shift is that they no longer have their own gear or specialized combat roles; instead, you can switch them between combat, healing, and damage dealing roles with a simple right click over their portrait. Playing as a Jedi Knight, that meant that all eight companions I met throughout the story focused on keeping me healed, which they did absurdly well. And so it goes for the roughly eight to 10 hours it takes to level from 60 to 65, until at last Knights of the Fallen Empire settles into what passes for its current endgame (until BioWare releases the tenth of the 16 chapters, scheduled for February 11). On the new hub world waiting at the end, the sight of other players came as a bit of a shock after so many hours of watching SWTOR try to masquerade as a single-player Knights of the Old Republic sequel. Even for someone like me, who regrets the loss of so many of SWTOR's cooperative elements, these other players can feel somewhat intrusive. In some ways, they are. Unless you actually choose to bring along friends, the current SWTOR endgame is every bit as single-player focused as the main story content if you don't choose to jump in old raids (which have been upscaled for level 65 players). It's centered on building alliances with various NPCs by undertaking flashpoints (SWTOR's fancy word for dungeons) and heroic missions ostensibly designed for two or more people, but all that rarely matters since the companions you can bring along remain as powerful as they did during the leveling content. There are some nice touches, such as a cinematic view for conversation that recalls Knights of the Old Republic and allows for more dialogue options beyond the usual three. The sight of other players came as a bit of a shock after so many hours of watching SWTOR try to be a single-player Knights of the Old Republic sequel. “ Unfortunately, it smacks of missed potential. The heroic missions send you off to beloved planets from the original launch like Hoth and Tatooine, and BioWare's decision to make the entire world sync to your level — Guild Wars 2-style — adds a touch of vitality these spots have long needed. Unless you're fresh off the starship, though, this is all stuff that feels overly familiar by now. Greater potential awaits in the Star Fortress flashpoints which can be tough solo after a recent companion nerf, but the six fortresses themselves look a tad too similar too each other and the experience devolves into the same \"fighting bad guys down metal corridors\" that pervades so much of SWTOR. Repeat these a bunch of times and turn in some crates, and the denizens of the galaxy will start to love you. It gets tiresome quickly, and that's bad news for an expansion that hinges on hoping players hold on to their subscriptions for each new episode. If you're just in it for the story, there are far worse ways to spend $15 (and it's included in the $15 subscription fee if you're already subscribed). BioWare wants to show us it can still tell a good Star Wars tale, and to its credit, it pulls it off. After all Star Wars: The Old Republic has been through after four years, though, it's more than a little tragic to see just how completely BioWare has shrugged off the non-story parts.",

        "Content": "Magicka: Wizard Wars seems like it should be better than it is. On paper it's a sure-fire winner: take Magicka, with its comical little wizards and huge number of elemental spell combos and counterspells, add team-based multiplayer, and make it free-to-play in a fair and appealing way. So why is the reality so frequently lackluster? It remains a fun game, because there’s something inherently enjoyable about that skill-based Magicka formula, but Wizard Wars shows how a poorly thought-out MOBA-inspired design can suck the magic out of a game. Developer Paradox North hasn’t done Wizard Wars any favors in saddling it with a surprisingly crude and unstable client. Wizard Wars may bring back some unwelcome memories of Magicka 1’s famously rocky co-op: half my attempts to join a session have ended in crashes or matchmaking failures. I've sat in a game lobby for several minutes, watching fellow players flicker in and out, resetting the countdown timer each time they reconnect. When a game ends, you get a fleeting glance at the score screen before \"CONNECTION LOST\" pops-up and you're dumped back to the main menu. Or the desktop, depending on how Wizard Wars is feeling that day. It's not game-killingly bad. Most of the time I'm able to find a match within a few minutes of sitting down (give or take a few restarts), and once I'm in, I'll almost certainly get to play it through to the end. But there are also times when either matchmaking is broken or there is practically nobody online playing – even in the week following the official launch. Either seems plausible, but it means that Wizard Wars is a game that I always approach with the mindset of \"I'll try to play,\" rather than \"I'm going to play.\" Once you get into a match, things are much more stable. The trouble is that even when Wizard Wars is on its best technical behavior, you're playing a MOBA version of Magicka where the MOBA and the Magicka aspects don't complement each other so much as just exist alongside each other. Of Wizard Wars' three game modes, Wizard Warfare is the clear winner. It's a control-point-based spawn-ticket game where the first team to run out of respawns, or to be locked out of all the spawn points, loses the game. It's fast-paced, dynamic, and progresses to a swift endgame. There are several different maps, each one has slightly different dynamics that allow for sneak attacks and rush strategies. The one-on-one Wizard Duel probably gives you purest magical competition. There's a couple teleporters to allow players to maneuver, but it really comes down to casting spells and blocks more effectively that your opponent. On the other hand, the distance is so compressed that it starts to feel a little random. Whoever gets a little behind on hit points is easy prey for spammed melee attacks, and wizard melees always felt a little anticlimactic to me.

You can queue up to three spells, combining different effects to make new spells, and then choosing how you want to cast them. It's all as enjoyable as ever, though a bit overwhelming at the start. With time, however, I took great satisfaction in casting protective wards on my character based on what spells other players were favoring (giving myself wards against Death and Fire magic, for instance, when I saw players making use of fiery beams of Death magic). Knowing what spells will be effective against which defenses, and how to deploy shields and traps of your own to defend yourself, gives Wizard Wars a bit of the feeling of a fighting game. That works well in Wizard War and the Duels, but the MOBA-style Soul Harvest game mode ends up being a misfire because it shoehorns Magicka gameplay into a drawn-out format that doesn’t suit it. Since Magicka wizards don't level up or get more powerful as the game goes on, there is nothing to create an endgame. The two teams merely cycle around creep camps, slaughtering the same groups of mindless monsters, until they bring down each other's defenses and can destroy the other team's effigy. Fighting other players is almost a waste of time, especially since the respawn timers never change. In fact, if you win a big teamfight near the end of a game, it becomes harder to finish them off because your opponents instantly respawn at their base, which means they'll be waiting for you when you get there. When you have a MOBA where you're telling your team not to fight other players because winning will cost you the game, something has gone awry. The odds of having a fair game are also pretty small, unfortunately. Whether it's because of the server instability issues that I experienced in the client, or because Wizard Wars does nothing to discourage people from abandoning games or being abusive (there's no \"report player\" option), most games I've played have seen the 4v4 erode into a 4v3, or even a 4v2 or 3v2. That's a hard blow in a Soul Harvest game, which depends entirely on team's abilities to spread out across the map to farm for souls. It's stuff like this that really hurts Wizard Wars as a competitive game. Not being able to report players is infuriating in a MOBA that allows friendly fire. One of my first games had a player on my team running around killing everyone in his path, whether a friendly or not, and it cost us the game after 30 or 40 minutes of misery. The griefer was the second-highest scoring player. Any online competitive game needs a way to deal with people like that. Wizard Wars doesn't have one. Since Magicka doesn't really have distinct characters (everyone is a faceless robed figure with access to the same set of spells) it's metagame elements take the place of traditional MOBA class and character distinctions. You can buy (with real money or in-game gold) items and equipment that provide special bonuses and penalties. You also gain experience and unlock masteries, which give you access to special equipment and special, limited-use powers (think \"ultimates\" in other MOBAs). So it's important to play to your strengths: I favor Death magic, so my special robe, staff, and underpants (hey, this is Magicka) all give me Death magic bonuses, but at the expense of penalties to Fire. So Fire has basically vanished from my repertoire while Death is a part of almost every spell combo I use. However, it's harder to approach other players the same way. You can see their bonuses before a match starts but, once you're in-game, who is going to remember that the green wizard with the chainmail has a healing bonus and extra HP while the guy in the ninja robes has… wait, I forgot what the ninja robe does. See what I mean? Finally, there is the store where you can buy things with real money or currency earned during battle. As you play, you get treasure chests that have to be unlocked with keys (similar to Dota 2’s system). You don't know what's in the chest, but you do know how rare it is, so there's always a temptation to go get some keys when you're sitting on particularly rare loot. You can also just buy some equipment outright. Yet I never felt like I was getting the hard sell. Wizard Wars isn't a poorer experience with basic gear, and fundamentally it's the same game no matter what you're using in battle. Which is, of course, Wizard Wars' biggest problem. As I said at the start, there is something fundamentally enjoyable about Magicka, and the same is true of Wizard Wars. Magicka has always been a lighter, sillier kind of game about semi-competent wizards running around blowing themselves and others to pieces. However, Wizard Wars' conservative approach to adapting Magicka to the MOBA template makes for a game that's long on repetition and short on tactical depth.",

        "Content": "When a top-down shooter like Nex Machina comes along, I’m reminded that even in this age of procedural open worlds and emergent storytelling, you don’t need a lot of buzzwords to have a good time. Its five stages of simple, fast, sometimes frantic bot-blasting can be daunting to the unprepared. But when I got a good run going, the responsive controls and exciting, sci-fi graphics made my frustrations with its sometimes nasty death penalty worth it. Each stage is divided up into rooms where you have to defeat several waves of robotic enemies, optionally saving defenseless humans to increase your score, before proceeding to the next. The baddies are both visually interesting and clever in their design, and every world introduces new ones so the combat never feels repetitive. Like in one of developer Housemarque’s previous games, Resogun, saving the human hostages adds a sense of urgency and encourages you to take risks and get aggressive. One of the main twists that separate Nex Machina from the typical top-down shooter is that as you progress through a level you’ll accumulate a set of power-ups that can come in any order. These include increasing your weapon spread, granting you a single-hit shield (normally you die from taking a single hit), and upgrading your dash from a speedy escape tool to an attack that deals explosive damage. Getting fully powered up is fun and rewarding, but it lacks variety since a fully powered-up character always has the same set of abilities in each of the five levels. Getting fully powered up is fun and rewardingThe way the powerups work with death also lends itself naturally to a sort of failure spiral that I wasn’t especially fond of. When you die, you drop one power-up and have to get back to the place you died to recover it. Corpse runs are a fine challenge, except that if you lose all your lives and are forced to use a continue, you lose all but one of your power-ups. That creates some ridiculously tough situations because the difference between a full brace of power-ups and none at all, especially on some of the stage bosses, is absolutely night and day. More than once, this forced me to restart a level because I died at or just before a boss, after having slogged through over a dozen extremely challenging rooms, and simply didn’t have enough mobility or firepower to have the slightest chance of coming back from that to win. It’s a sort of artificial spiral that punishes you for failure with more failure, making subsequent attempts more difficult than the first, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. Expect a lot of restarts to get that one, perfect run on higher difficulties. The art really steals the show from level to level, acting as a bit of a balm on the grind of getting demolished over and over as you learn the ropes. Each environment, from the depths of a smoldering volcano to a brutalist, dystopian cityscape, has a strong sense of personality and is filled with little details that add to the ambience without becoming distracting. The enemy designs are simple but effective, with distinct silhouettes that let you quickly distinguish which ones are dangerous in which specific ways while there’s utter chaos unfolding all over the screen. The explosions for the various special weapons and death animations for bosses and minions are also highly satisfying, and supported by impactful sound effects. Depending on the difficulty level and your own skill, it might take you anywhere between three and 10 hours to beat Nex Machina’s arcade mode, in which you play through all the levels in order. But beyond its first playthrough, it’s set up to be a great platform for challenge-seekers and high-score chasers. The most interesting of these is arena mode, which challenges you to complete a single level with some kind of modifier (enemies are sped up, or having to complete the level in a limited time), awarding you bronze, silver, and gold medals for meeting certain score thresholds. You’ll also be ranked on a global leaderboard for each challenge and earn XP to level up your profile, all of which seems like an exciting way to engage the community with an ongoing quest for bragging rights.",

        "Title": "Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past Review",
        "Subtitle": "A respectful remake of a vast RPG, weathered slightly by age.",
        "Subheader": "By Chris Schilling Updated: Aug 17, 2021 12:02 am Posted: Sep 13, 2016 1:00 pm",
        "Content": "In a fast-moving medium like games the passage of time can be particularly cruel, but remakes give us the opportunity to revisit games as our fallible brains recall them rather than as they actually were, and introduce them to new generations without having to look past stale graphics and design. Dragon Quest VII is a sensitive update of a 16-year-old JRPG that captures the spirit of the respected original, though it doesn’t quite fill in all of the wrinkles of its outdated design. New players should be warned that this game is, even by JRPG standards, a huge commitment. If you know exactly what you’re doing and where you’re going, you could conceivably finish the story within 75 hours – those who remember playing through the 2000 PlayStation original (released in North America a year later as Dragon Warrior VII) will find little to hinder their progress. But for most players the runtime will extend well into three figures. Completists, meanwhile, might be advised to clear their schedule until December. That’s December 2017. I’m not convinced it always manages to justify such volume (you could say that for most JRPGs) but even if it takes its sweet time on occasion its payoffs reward your patience. The introduction has been intelligently streamlined. “ Despite its formidable size, one of the first things seasoned JRPG fans will notice is that the introduction has been intelligently streamlined. It’s still quite some time before you’ll face your first monster battle, but you don’t have quite so long to wait until you’re exploring the wider world. It might seem an unusually slow start by modern standards, but it helps establish its central trio and why they’re so keen to leave their home: your young avatar, the rebellious Prince Kiefer, and inquisitive local girl Maribel are all certain there must be life beyond their lonely island, despite the protestations of others that nothing lies beyond its shores but an endless sea. If every JRPG journey is essentially a coming-of-age tale about the world getting bigger – their youthful heroes learning and growing as they’re exposed to different places and people outside their home – Dragon Quest VII takes the metaphor more literally. The title gives the goal away: as you explore you’ll find stone fragments that, when placed on plinths at a mythical temple, unlock portals to new realms from a forgotten time. In each new place, you’ll arrive at a time of crisis with a problem to solve; once you’ve done that you’ll find the island is now accessible in the present day. This structural shift makes for a very different kind of journey. Where most JRPGs have a strong plot that drives you forward, this is essentially a collection of small, self-contained stories. At times it’s like watching a season of a favourite TV show that spends the first two-thirds on mystery-of-the-week episodes before belatedly bringing in the big bad for the closing stretch. You do lose something of the party’s personal journey, but these intimate little vignettes are nicely told and offer plenty of variety. You’ll be asked to convince a god-fearing community not to go ahead with a dangerous ritual, witness a thorny love triangle, and defend a city against an army of automatons (with a surprisingly moving coda). Dragon Quest 7 sends a positive message about embracing other cultures. “ The effect is like playing through a series of unusually expansive side quests, and that’s not necessarily a complaint - though one or two could have perhaps been trimmed and not much would be lost. In inviting you to observe each island’s quirks and rituals, Dragon Quest 7 sends a positive message about embracing other cultures, conveyed by an excellent localisation that works hard to distinguish each settlement from the next. It repeats a trick we’ve seen before in previous Dragon Quest remakes by using dialogue inflections to convey a range of accents, from Texan to Italian, Irish to German. But while purists might be unhappy with some of the name changes, the writers haven’t gone overboard with the puns and the writing adds humour and texture. The downside is that while you’re supposedly helping the world get bigger, it doesn’t really feel like you’re expanding its boundaries because you’re often contained within a relatively small part of it. Even within each island there’s a lot of back and forth between areas. Rather than spending a short time in a new place and then moving on, as in most JRPGs, I sometimes felt stuck in a holding pattern for just a little too long. It doesn’t help that many of the people you meet look the same, with frequently recycled character models. The writing might be trying its best to convince you otherwise, but it’s hard to mourn the death of an NPC in one section when minutes later you arrive in a new town where he appears to have been cloned. Revamped graphics really do justice to the characterful monster designs. “ That might be a minor gripe, but it’s all the more disappointing given the visual lick of paint elsewhere. The original game was considered pretty ugly in its time, but the revamped graphics really do justice to Akira Toriyama’s characterful monster designs (the walking corpses are surely gaming’s most adorable zombies). And though the field environments are sparse, the villages and towns are suitably lively and the dungeons appropriately labyrinthine and imposing. In that light, it’s strange that the interface is so old-fashioned and occasionally counter-intuitive. You’ll often find NPCs repeating lines because you triggered another conversation when you were trying to skip through their dialogue, and while shopkeepers will kindly rearrange your items to make room for new purchases you’ll still have to go through the painstaking process of selling items individually and transferring things one by one between party members before they can be equipped. You’ll rarely need to worry too much about the composition of your team. “ The relative lack of difficulty in the turn-based combat is a more debatable issue. Dragon Quest has always been designed as an entry-level RPG, and its easygoing challenge won’t be a problem for those wanting to get on with the story. It does, however, mean that there’s little incentive for most players to fully get to grips with the interesting but underused job system that comes into play around 20 hours in, give or take. Though there’s a wide range of vocations to choose from, with additional specialities available once you’ve mastered the basic roles, outside the optional endgame content you’ll rarely need to worry too much about the composition of your team. As long as you’ve got a healer with plenty of MP in reserve and a couple of powerful attackers, you’ll probably breeze past most bosses without coming close to dying. This might not be an issue for those who play JRPGs for the story, but if you’re looking for a sterner test you’ll be waiting quite a while. This new version attempts to address that with one of its new features, though this isn’t introduced for a surprisingly long time. Connecting to other players via StreetPass allows you to send monsters you’ve befriended to share special fragments. Each connection will raise your monster’s level, which in turn unlocks new dungeons with more powerful creatures to face. With such a substantial story and an embarrassment of optional diversions – some players will spend hours in the casino alone – this isn’t a game that really needs greater longevity, but the truly committed will be delighted to know it’s there.",

        "Content": "How far can an expansion to a great game fall? It's a tough question, and one that Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, the latest DLC add-on for Borderlands 2, had me asking early, and often. After all, it still has the same, sound shoot-and-loot mechanics from the main game, along with plenty of new enemies to take aim at. How different can it really feel? The answer is “a lot,” and in this case different doesn't mean better. Big Game Hunt manages to stay just enjoyable enough to get a pass, but it's still easily the weakest add-on Gearbox has put on the table for Borderlands 2 thus far. The setup for Big Game Hunt brims with opportunity. Sir Hammerlock, the bionic-armed gentleman hunter from the main campaign, has invited you out to his cabin in the savage lands of Aegrus for a quiet weekend of hunting and hijinks – you know, like tracking and fighting tons of huge, unique monsters for loot, honor, and the Borderlands way. Sadly, what it turns out to be is a short, uninspired quest line to take down yet another self-proclaimed evil genius. Enter Professor Nakayama, a one-dimensional new villain whose only discernible trait is that he's obsessed with the late Handsome Jack, a trait hammered home ad nauseum from start to finish with tepid writing that falls well short of the Borderlands norm. Sir Hammerlock gets similar treatment, with repeated attempts to squeeze laughs out of how much of a gentleman he is, and to little effect. After Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage nailed the comedy, Big Game Hunt feels like a step back. More so than the usual monsters, the main quest here focuses the fighting on tribal savages, Nakayama's followers who share his... enthusiasm for Handsome Jack. Despite enemies sporting an interesting assortment of never-before-seen abilities, these fights can become grueling slogs thanks almost entirely to one particular new enemy type: the witch doctor. Big Game Hunt feels like a step back. “ It would be irritating enough if these nuisances only healed themselves and every enemy within a football field sized radius in the blink of an eye -- but they've also got a metric ton of hit points, as well as a slew of other skills that make them an absolute pain. Their voodoo masks make them immune to headshots, they randomly deflect or avoid melee attacks (even Zero's action skill), and their powerful elemental attacks give them one-shot killing potential if you aren't geared well enough. To top it all off, witch doctors can cast a spell that upgrades nearby allies into badass, super badass or ultimate badass ranks. This new foe is challenging, sure, but more importantly he’s exhausting to the point you’re better off saving time and ammunition by running away. Fortunately, the other enemy types are generally more fun to fight, but some still seem like a lot of risk for little reward. Unless you really put yourself in harm’s way to land criticals, spiders and giant flying spores absorb inordinate amounts of punishment. Oddly, the big game creatures the title refers to are far less threatening, going down relatively easily once you've discerned their patterns. Personally, I would have preferred more varied and challenging unique creatures to getting crushed by common ones. In both scope and ambition, Big Game Hunt never fully lives up to its name.",

        "Title": "Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Is it truly a timeless classic?",
        "Subheader": "By Mark Ryan Sallee Updated: May 10, 2012 5:30 pm Posted: Jul 28, 2009 4:00 pm",
        "Content": "I first played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 at E3 in Los Angeles--nine years ago. Though it's been a while since my Dreamcast gave up the ghost, I remember the game well. In the first month I owned the home version, I maxed out the in-game clock at ninety-nine hours and fifty-nine seconds. I spent three years of my life playing with this same intensity.  It'd be easy to assume that, almost a decade after its initial release, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has nothing more to offer folks like me. And yet today I find myself, plugged into a console of the HD-era and flinging Air Hyper Viper Beams in widescreen, reliving the addictive joy of training mode. The game's staying power reaches beyond me, as national Marvel vs. Capcom 2 tournaments still draw crowds, evidenced by this year's massive Evo Championship Series in Las Vegas.   Beyond the allure of training mode, the modern downloadable release of the game brings with it a few enticing additions. For the videophiles enamored with their HD televisions, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 now offers an optional widescreen mode with gently massaged graphics that won't embarrass modern LCD displays. The widescreen expansion isn't very elegantly executed, but at least it's kept from perverting the gameplay. Some background items don't match the edge of the screen, and character portraits that accompany hyper combos leave awkward gaps where the screen was stretched. There are other visual foibles introduced by the widescreen view which all suggest that not much effort went into the conversion.  The other visual enhancements are similarly simple, but more effective. The raw sprites, in all their blocky pixel quality, are free to behold should the default video filters prove unsuitable. But the \"crisp\" filter actually cleans up the look of characters while maintaining sharp edges, and effectively makes the \"smooth\" filter completely unnecessary. The latter gets rid of the classic blockiness but introduces a typical sprite filter blur of which I'm no fan. The game's polygonal backgrounds are now rendered in HD, which furthers the quality gap between the characters and their backdrops. The modern, 3D backgrounds may be a bit at odds with the fifteen-year-old sprites (they always were), but they certainly look nicer than ever.  But much more important than any graphic enhancement is the addition of online multiplayer. Like most of Capcom's fighting games, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 makes most sense with human competition and, provided the existing fan base for the game makes the HD jump, there should be no lack of live players to challenge. Online options are minimal, as the game offers just ranked and friendly matches with lobbies of up to six players. In our experience, the online play ranged from nearly flawless to jumpy yet fully playable, even with the optional input delay set to max. Hopefully the quality holds up under the duress of public hammering. But one mildly serious issue exists even in our controlled environment: During the versus loading screen, players cannot secretly swap character order by holding down the assist buttons, a feature that's in the arcade and Dreamcast originals and is even available in the offline modes of this HD update. (It's possible that this limitation is purposely imposed to enforce a tournament rule I'm not aware of.)  Otherwise, the gameplay in the modern port is flawless.  Though it's been eons since I last played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 in any significant quantity, the combos and exploits learned years ago came rushing back--privately recite the chorus of Live's \"Lightning Crashing\" to get the idea. Though the game now displays in widescreen, the play field is constrained to the original aspect ratio, a smart design choice that prevents the visual change from inadvertently impacting the gameplay balance. Controls are tight as ever, and everything feels as it should, down to bugs that existed in the original versions of the game. The \"Juggernaut Glitch\" and other fun bugs are faithfully represented, though certain game-breaking exploits--like Gambit's infinitely high wall jump--are graciously removed. Our 360 copy of the game has a few frame hiccups on character selection and at the start of matches that don't appear on PS3, an issue that could keep the Xbox version from tournament worthiness without seriously impacting the gameplay.",

        "Subheader": "By Tom Marks Updated: Feb 8, 2018 9:47 pm Posted: Jan 18, 2018 11:24 pm",
        "Content": "[Editor's Note: This review and score replaces our original November 2015 review. Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]  The tension before you breach a room in Rainbow Six Siege is often palpable. I’ll place a charge on one door while our sniper Glaz watches the windows from outside, and then wait for our teammate playing Dokkaebi to distract the enemies with a phone call before blowing it wide open. Coordination is key, and working together to get the most out of each our Operators’ abilities can be even more valuable as landing a good headshot – though the headshots definitely help.  Siege has come a long way since it launched two years ago (read our original Rainbow Six Siege review ). A steady stream of new maps, operators, and cosmetic items - along with a heaping helping of bug fixes, balance changes, and stability improvements - have slowly transformed it into a much deeper competitive game, even if there are some growing pains that come along with that. Siege has always been a fun and challenging FPS, but as it enters its third year it has gained a pull that’s become hard to resist.   The core of Siege hasn’t changed; a 5v5 dance of attack and defense between well-equipped military special forces squads on compact but complex maps. A wonderful emphasis on strategy and smart play over pure twitch aiming gives it a distinct feel that you don’t get from games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Often times figuring out which door to barricade and which to break open can win you more games than just being able to outgun your opponents.  Learning which door to barricade can win you more games than just outgunning your opponent. “  Each round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled drones. It’s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious, Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of as much information as possible. It’s only a minute long, but there are a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great.  Most of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They’re also littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn’t get any better.   There are currently 15 maps in the casual matchmaking queue, only nine of which are in ranked, each visually distinct and set in different locations across the globe, which results in a fantastic amount of variety every time I sit down to play. I love that I often won’t see the same map twice in an evening of games, but the flipside is that it takes longer to actually learn the layouts of those maps. Still, it’s a tradeoff that ultimately improves Siege. Talking the Talk  Working with your teammates, either through voice chat, text, or just map markers and pings is a simple but extremely impactful thing you can do to get better at Siege. It can be a big ask to rely on the voices of internet strangers (and Siege definitely has its fair share of unfriendly and unhelpful players) but overall I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how this community understands and embraces good communication as a tool.  A great example of how communication can win games is with security cameras and drones. You can use cameras to mark the location of enemies for your whole team, but doing so will also warn the marked player that they’ve been seen, often resulting in them quickly hunting down and destroying that camera. But if you don’t mark enemies, and instead talk to your teammates and tell them where that person is, you can give them the same information without alerting your opponent. You can still use those same cameras after you’ve died too, which cleverly cuts out a lot of down-time as you continue to help any surviving teammates.   Of course, you’ll still run into plenty of people mindlessly tagging with cameras in public matchmaking. Like many competitive games, Siege is almost always more fun when played with friends I can comfortably coordinate with. Timing breaches and calling out flash grenades will let you get the drop on a defending team, but the short two to three-minute rounds and setup period between those tense moments also leaves room for goofing off in between.  Bringing the grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble, so plan carefully. “  Siege has just three PvP game modes, all of which revolve around one team protecting a room (or two rooms, in the case of the Bomb mode) and the other team trying to break through their defenses. They are different enough in subtle ways that influence what walls you want to reinforce or which operators you should use - for example, bringing the blind grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble - but the general approach either team takes in a given mode can feel a little too similar.  As a side activity to the competitive battles there’s the PvE Terrorist Hunt mode and the single-player Situations. Both of these modes are great, and I often find myself warming up for PvP by taking on the AI first. The Situations are runs through the same multiplayer maps against AI, and can feel as compelling as a fully built-out single-player mission at times, which makes it a bit disappointing that we haven’t seen any new ones as everything else grows around it. (The first season of year three begins in March, and is expected to add a new kind of PvE mode called Outbreak, which will hopefully be a bit of what I’m hoping for.)  Role Call  Another way Siege has grown is its ever-expanding cast of Operators. Sixteen new characters have been added so far, which makes a current total of 36 with eight more coming in the next year. The result is more dynamic and varied matches, both in how you play and who you have to play against. Unlike the maps, it’s much easier to remember what each operator does, which helps the large roster not feel daunting to learn. You only really have to keep track of their special ability and what type of gun they might be using, but they’re still unique enough to leave ample room for different playstyles and strategies.  Every Rainbow Six Siege Operator (Year 1 and 2) 36 Images  An operator like Mira completely changes the landscape of a map when picked, with the ability to put impenetrable one-way mirrors into otherwise solid walls. Other operators like Caveira, who can silence her footsteps and then interrogate downed enemies to learn the position of their teammates, or Vigil, who can become invisible to cameras and drones, are built to be played as aggressive, roaming defenders. Their presence enables new strategies that simply weren’t as viable at launch. Abilities like this have changed Siege in very real ways, and the increased options keep Siege from ever feeling repetitive.  Better still, the benefit of that variety can be felt even if you don’t have these new operators unlocked for yourself. I didn’t necessarily feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any given character, as very few operators in Siege feel like either “must picks” or completely underpowered. I wished I could use certain locked operators, sure, but the 20 base operators that have been there from the beginning are still strong, fun, and varied enough to make the significantly higher Renown cost (Siege’s in-game currency) of any that came after them less frustrating.  You don’t start with any Operators unlocked, with the original 20 costing between 500 and 2,500 Renown, a relatively small amount that comes quickly enough from playing matches. All the new operators, however, are a massive 25,000. It can take at least 20 hours of play (on the low-end) to gather that much renown, but you also have the option to buy operators with real money for $5 a pop.   With only eight released in a year, 25,000 renown isn’t so hard to collect for regular players who have kept up to date, but it’s pretty steep for newcomers who are trying to catch up. Siege does feel like it has been set up to encourage players to spend real money on its year-long passes, which provide every new operator released in their given time period (plus some extra premium currency and other goodies) for $30. It’s akin to an annual subscription fee, but nearly everything but some premium cosmetics can be earned without spending any money beyond buying the base game.  It's disappointing that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped in price since their release. “  That said, I’m disappointed that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped in price since their release. The Year-One and Year-Two passes have both left the store, and the one option to get them cheaper is a slightly discounted bundle only available for real money. I’d love to see these older operators drop to a Renown cost to make them more inviting to new players once their release hype has long passed.  The store, in general, suffers from growing pains that Siege has yet to address. A massive amount of cosmetic gun skins, gun charms, and operator outfits are available, with new ones arriving as often as weekly. Nearly all of these cosmetics can be unlocked with Renown, and some of them are extremely cool. The gun skins, in particular, tend to be varied and gorgeous, everything from being textured like gems to having detailed tigers stretching up the barrel. Many of the most recent operator outfits and headgear options have started branching into cool and creative territory beyond just different shades of camo, like Valkyrie’s Pop Art make-up or Blackbeard’s dapper top hat.  The problem, however, is that the store itself has become a big pile of stuff that’s nearly impossible to navigate. It’s hard to browse and hard to search, especially when it comes to bundles. Items will helpfully tell you if they are available in a bundle, but there’s no way to then go to that bundle directly, and the bundles tab is an ungodly long text list with a single image to explain everything that’s in it.   Siege wisely keeps the items in its store away from anything that really affects gameplay. There are a variety of gun scopes and barrel attachments that can be unlocked with Renown that do offer mid-match advantages, but they are cheap enough that this power boost never felt walled off or like it was compromising balance.  And, once again, what your gun looks like and the scope you are using can mean next to nothing if your opponent can simply outthink you. Siege has continued to double down on that focus on smart play over the years, and it’s made it a game I want to keep playing for a long time to come. Looking forward, Ubisoft has already laid out a free update plan for Siege’s third year, including eight more operators, two new maps, and the Outbreak game mode, meaning things don’t show any sign of slowing down.",

        "Content": "Metal Gear Survive is a weird game. In its sometimes clumsy efforts to merge stealth action, base-building, survival sim, and horror by stitching together pieces from past Metal Gear games, it’s effectively scrubbed those elements of the series’ signature humor and personality. That uniquely wild mix of sharp socio-political commentary and zany military sci-fi that has defined Metal Gear is swapped out in favor of a subpar fantasy plot involving zombies and wormholes, delivered by a cast of underdeveloped characters.  But there is fun to be had in Metal Gear Survive’s mishmash of ideas and the repetitive, yet comforting loop of resource-gathering and base-building, if you’re willing to power through many hours of initial tedium.   Survive opens with a lot of questions. Why did a wormhole open up above Militaires Sans Frontières’ Caribbean forward operating base, what is the true nature of this boring, zombie-infested dimension it’s dropped all these people into, and what does it have to do with Diamond Dogs, whose Seychelles Mother Base (which did not exist during the events of Ground Zeroes) stands in a twisted heap overlooking your character’s new forward operating base? As a long-time Metal Gear fan, I was not amused by these perceived continuity errors in Survive’s dry opening cutscene – but fans protective of the series can rest assured that in the course of its 25- to 30-hour single-player campaign, these inconsistencies are eventually addressed.  A small handful of cool moments doesn't redeem its flat story or characters. “ The problem is the answers aren’t very interesting. Flat, forgettable characters dole out a bland story that is, at best, a silly reimagined spin-off of Metal Gear canon with some initially promising horror elements that quickly lose steam. At worst, it’s a laughable adaptation of much better ideas that loses the heart, soul, and intelligence of its predecessors. Its story seems to exist merely to justify the creative liberties Survive has taken with the series’ theme and genre. There are a small handful of cool moments, mostly involving Masahiro Ito of Silent Hill fame’s horrific creations, but they fail to redeem it. It’s only thanks to the fact that there was enough going on outside of the story’s long stretches of robotic exposition that it wasn’t a total bore.  Every IGN Metal Gear Review 19 Images  The opening hours of gameplay, though, are pretty boring. Tutorials are rarely fun, and this one stretches on longer than most as it has you running several near-identical fetch quests and teaches you how to manage your hunger and thirst meters, scavenge for resources to build entry-level gear, and harvest zombies for Kubon energy, the main in-game currency used for everything from crafting to leveling up.  Outer Hell  Customization adds a welcome human element to balance out the menu-heavy micromanagement. “ While things take a while to pick up, I fell into a pretty comfortable base-building routine once they did. After returning from a mission, I’d repair my gear at my workbench, restock on ammo, cook whatever food I’d been able to scavenge for, boil some clean water for drinking, and check my farms and water purifiers for output. Each task is done at a different station that you can drag and drop to a location of your choosing, effectively letting you create your own little survival camp. My current base has small huts and tents set up near the campfire where I can sleep and cook. Nearby are my food and medicine repositories for keeping my crew healthy, and opposite my farms, several advanced gear, weapon, and gadget workshops for crafting new equipment.  Being able to manually rearrange each station to my liking and actually see my small group of NPC survivors working on their assigned tasks brought a welcome human element to Survive’s otherwise technical, menu-heavy micromanagement. I’ve grown attached to my base and feel compelled to flesh it out with more survivors, found in rescue missions around the map, and resources for building and maintaining new structures.   The best crafting materials are found in The Dust, a dangerous, unmappable zone where the majority of Survive’s resource-gathering and zombie-slaying action takes place. Those who have played Metal Gear Solid 5 will recognize The Dust as a recycled version of the Afghanistan map from The Phantom Pain, only blanketed in a thick fog and stripped of interesting landmarks. (Remember when the Skulls would show up and everything would become misty? It’s like that, but permanent.)  Survive seems to fundamentally misunderstand the circumstances that make stealth fun. “ Encounters with the Wanderers, Survive’s base enemy type, are similarly bland. The standard crystal-headed zombies dominate the vast majority of the combat, and it isn’t until more than halfway through the campaign that their slightly more interesting variants start to show up in greater frequency. Overall, Survive’s enemies are mindless and predictable — they don’t interact with each other in any dynamic way and they don’t exhibit any challenging behaviors to overcome. They also don’t chase you for very long, so attracting their attention has few consequences. The one reason you benefit from a stealthier approach is because an enemy taken down with a sneaky backstab will contain more Kubon energy to harvest, but the currency is hardly in short supply. With an initially limited toolset of weapons and abilities, a lack of diverse situations to adapt to, and few compelling reasons to bother, Survive seems to fundamentally misunderstand the circumstances that have made fun, stealthy escapades possible in previous Metal Gear games.  Surviving With Friends  Its combat is at its best during hectic wave-based defense missions. “ Where Survive’s action thrives is in its wave-based defense missions, which are also the format of its four-player co-op salvage missions in multiplayer with some minor differences. In single-player, you need to come prepared for each mission beforehand, which means crafting barriers, healing items, and other gear back at base — if you run out, tough luck. In multiplayer, you get a chance to craft and choose your loadout in the lobby, but you also have access to a shared pool of resources gathered in-game once the match starts if you want to craft anything further. Between and even during waves, you can run simple side-missions that give you access to more defensive methods for protecting your wormhole digger as it mines for energy. Even with an uncoordinated team, it’s extremely simple to S-rank the Easy missions you’re forced to play at first because Normal and Hard don’t unlock until you hit a certain level, but that isn’t a bad thing. Multiplayer is a good way to get a break from the trudge of single-player and stock up on gear to make story missions easier.  Playing salvage missions is a fun way to grind for resources that carry into single-player. “ In both modes, Survive’s melee-heavy combat feels good from a mechanical standpoint, even before you’re resource-rich enough to afford ammo. But the fun doesn’t come from poking or shooting the same zombie in the face over and over again. It’s in those hectic moments where you’re struggling to manage the onslaught of Wanderers from every direction, bouncing between several entry points at once and fortifying your defenses between waves. I found it more viable to save up barriers for cutting off lanes of enemies closer to their spawns rather than waiting for them to come to base, choking the smaller hordes early on to make later waves more manageable. Even though the combat amounts to little more than repetitive hacky-slash brawls, like something out of Dynasty Warriors, it was fun to learn and develop small tricks for dealing with enemies. Individual Wanderers may not pose any kind of interesting challenge, but fending them off as a horde can get the blood flowing. One particularly fun late-game mission had me defending a point solo for 15 minutes straight, and it made the two hours of grinding for supplies in preparation feel worth it.  Making Diamonds From Ashes  The hypnotic resource-gathering base-building loop feels like a casual game made up of Phantom Pain parts. “ Survive is heavy on the grind, but once you have something compelling to grind for — a new weapon you’re eager to craft, more ammo, more energy so you can level up and get a handy new skill — it isn’t entirely a chore. Stocking up on resources out in The Dust or playing salvage missions in multiplayer for rare materials and gear can be fun when you’re working toward a goal. And, as your base grows more complicated to manage, story missions get more difficult, and you get into the rhythm of managing your hunger and thirst meters, you’ll find yourself managing several personal goals at once.  At one point I was in dire need of a high-voltage battery to craft a new electrified spear, and finally finding the rare material in a pile of plastic and spare screws while out hunting for food was a pleasant surprise. That hypnotic resource-gathering base-building loop feels akin to a casual game made up of Phantom Pain parts, and that was surprisingly enjoyable once I set aside my reservations about Survive not really being a Metal Gear game.  Tactical Espionage Microtransaction   The darker side of that is its microtransactions, particularly the one that requires you to pay $10 to start a new character without erasing your old one. I never felt pressured to dish out real money for new loadout slots, additional expedition teams, or other areas where the opportunity to make in-game purchases pop up, but requiring money for two save game slots is something I hope Konami changes its mind on.",

        "Content": "Hello Call of Duty fans! This year we're trying something new: because Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's modes are so different, we're reviewing them separately, followed by our overall review and score. You can read more about the review plan here . This part covers the entirety of Black Ops 4 – be sure to check out the individual reviews next.   Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Zombies Review  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Multiplayer Review  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review   The monumental highs of victory and crushing lows of narrowly losing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4’s Blackout are experiences I've had in other battle royale games before, but the road to these memorable moments highlight a significant leap in gameplay fidelity and polish for the genre. Call of Duty’s responsive and forgiving gunplay, nimble movement, and creative but practical equipment fit beautifully into the trendy last man standing format. It’s not just a one-way street though, as the dynamic battle royale setting provides some much-needed variance and consequence to Call of Duty’s at times superficial combat loop. I did experience and see others have some technical issues that warrant concern, but when it’s running smoothly, Blackout is nothing short of the most enjoyable battle royale I’ve played to date. Blackout is nothing short of the most enjoyable battle royale I’ve played to date. “ Blackout gets straight to what I love most about battle royales: using what I’ve found for an all or nothing skirmish with an equally desperate opponent with the least amount of noise in the way. I was immediately struck by the silky smooth transition between free falling, parachuting, and landing, and the fluidity doesn’t stop there. Sliding, jumping, and mantling all blend seamlessly into one another, and this momentum remains unbroken even while performing other actions. You can heal while sprinting, shoot underwater, and fire your weapon while using other equipment. These intuitive touches capitalize on an area where battle royales as a genre still have room left to grow away from the clunky controls of their military simulation progenitors. I was initially concerned that being able to heal and move at the same time would lead to comically drawn out firefights, but in practice, I never experienced a single instance of an enemy being able to out-heal the damage I was able to inflict without finding cover first. The only place where I feel depth is sacrificed in order to facilitate accessibility is the woefully under-featured inventory. Only one weapon is displayed at a time and you shockingly can’t drag or reorder items at all on PC. I’d like to be able to reposition equipment for easy access, as well as smoothly drag attachments from one weapon to another instead of awkwardly dumping them all on the ground. You also can’t open your inventory and then pick up items based on their proximity, which makes looting an enemy’s corpse and moving at the same time a bit clunky. There are a few nice touches, though, like the ability to pick up ammo without filling up valuable inventory space, but PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is still miles ahead in this department. Captivating Cache Blackout does, however, absolutely nail the concept of interesting loot. Its arsenal is rich and varied and leaves plenty of room to develop a taste for unlikely personal favorites on your way to acquiring objectively powerful weapons like the Paladin. In addition to the appearance of every primary and secondary weapon found in multiplayer (with the exception of the combat knife), there are weapons from Zombies like the Ray Gun, MP40, and the GRAV. Gold-tinted guns like the “Titan Operator” are scattered across the map and come equipped with a full set of attachments. Then there are perks, which offer fun and useful temporarily buffs like the ability to move silently or hear the sound of far-off enemy footsteps. But the star of the show in Blackout as far as loot is concerned is equipment. Not only is each piece of equipment fun and practical but together they keep encounters with other players feeling fresh. The grapple gun, for instance, can be used to instantly gain a vertical advantage, escape from an otherwise hopeless situation, or even close the distance to pull off an unlikely revive. Landing a well-placed sensor dart in the final circle felt almost as good as firing the game-winning shot. And the inevitable late-game barrage of flashbangs and grenades you know and love from other battle royales can even be thwarted with a well placed “trophy system” straight out of Jager’s kit in Rainbow Six Siege. The result of this cornucopia of loot is a map littered with appealing variables that each offer unique gameplay opportunities. The result of Blackout's cornucopia of loot is a map littered with appealing variables that each offer unique gameplay opportunities. “ The map itself is a sort of greatest hits of the Black Ops series. Original elements are cleverly combined with iconic locales like Nuketown, Array, and Turbine that lend an unprecedented level of design fidelity to the map’s overall offerings. Though it didn’t always happen, I absolutely loved it when the final circle closed onto one of these locations as it effectively turned that particular match into a sudden death bout on a tried-and-true Black Ops map. In addition to conventional Call of Duty maps, locations like Verrückt and Diner from Zombies are peppered across the landscape. These spots and a few others can spawn zombies randomly, and their presence is designated with a pale blue column of light. If you kill all the zombies, you’ll score a mystery box! The risk and reward dynamic of going loud for some extra loot is a fun one, and since the zombies are relegated to a handful of locations, they don’t get in the way of the core experience when they’re unwanted. Spray and Pray Black Ops 4’s gunplay – and not some other mechanic – takes center stage in its battle royale experience. The responsive and forgiving “hitscan” feeling that’s synonymous with the series is intact at close ranges, in spite of Blackout using a projectile-based damage calculation system complete with bullet drop and travel time. As a result, landing a distant headshot with a sniper rifle is remarkably satisfying. Though the recoil is supposedly predictable, I couldn’t discern any consistent pattern on weapons like the Rampart 17, Spitfire, or Titan -- overall, I feel the recoil is more random (albeit much less pronounced) than it is in PUBG. Time to kill on PC varies from instantaneous to the outer limits of reasonable based on a number of different factors, but for the most part feels functional. Every IGN Call of Duty Review 53 Images The increase in effective HP conferred by the famously durable level three armor proved to be a non-issue in my experience, mostly because Blackout offers both the details needed to inform my strategy, and the tools necessary to execute it. Unlike Fortnite’s shields, armor is visually and audibly readable before a fight begins. And as such, I usually had no problem figuring out how to overcome this advantage with the equipment and weapons I had on me. The puzzle of adapting to change and succeeding in spite of a disadvantage is the essence of why I enjoy battle royales so much. I do, however, take issue with the fact that an enemy’s armor is almost always destroyed in the process of killing them. I had no problem restocking my ammo, healing items, and equipment reserves while looting a slain foe, but if I wanted armor I’d have to look elsewhere. And in order to realistically keep that armor until the later stages of a match, I’d have to avoid a fight. If defeated enemies instead dropped whatever armor they had on at 50% durability this wouldn’t be an issue. But in its current state, I feel like being punished for partaking in my favorite part of Blackout: the combat. Time to kill on PC varies from instantaneous to the outer limits of reasonable based on a number of different factors, but for the most part feels functional. “ Random loot spawns are a core pillar of battle royales, and in this department, I feel that Blackout distributes do or die early-game weapons in a fair and forgiving manner with one glaring exception. The models of weapons and ammo don’t render until you’re on the ground, and are therefore not visible during the initial freefall, even at max settings. This makes landing in a hotly contested area much more of a dice roll than it should be, even if you land first. I’d prefer the ability to steer my parachute towards what looks like the outline of a gun mid-flight. Duos and quads offered some of the most memorable moments I experienced in Blackout, but also presented the most technical issues. Getting all of my friends into the same lobby on PC proved to be a consistent struggle. The invite features would frequently either disappear after being accepted, or present the receiver with a “lobby not joinable” or “NAT type issue” error. Grouping up to a full squad of four often devolved into a round robin of “who's lobby can everyone join without an error?” These problems can be solved by port forwarding, which isn’t too difficult to do, but it’s worth noting that this is an unexpectedly involved fix for a game as big as Call of Duty in 2018. The connectivity issues can persist into a match, too. A few of my squadmates suffered disconnects or crashes almost every game until they were resolved by a fair deal of troubleshooting. Some PC players have reported crashes in Black Ops 4 caused by equipping a certain weapon skin, skipping the intro cutscenes, or by conflicts with Microsoft services, older graphics drivers, and antivirus software. I personally experienced a recurring crash on startup that was resolved by scanning and repairing Black Ops 4’s file. From what I can gather, neither the severity or breadth of these issues are that out of the ordinary, but for the Blackout mode specifically, any amount of instability is a big deal in the absence of reconnect functionality. The inability to rejoin a match already in progress is a sorely missed feature from PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.If my squadmates disconnected, it meant that the entire squad could either forfeit the match instead of leaving our teammate behind or, if the match had gone on long enough, the odd man out was relegated to the lobby until we had finished. But when no one disconnected, quads and duos were remarkably fun. Here, Blackout's vehicles proved to be an unexpected treat. For a series not known for its vehicles, I was absolutely stunned that the flatbed truck and helicopter offered such a smooth ride-along experience. With a friend driving, you're free to move, jump, and shoot in the bed of the truck without the usual hitching or desynchronous experience that this might cause in many other games. Similarly, the helicopter can be a massively fun change of pace if can you manage to keep it in the air for any significant amount of time. In addition to the substantial thrill of winning, Blackout boasts additional rewarding Easter egg-like challenges in the form of fun and frantic character missions. Unlocking Crash, for instance, involves finishing a match with 15 healing items in your inventory, in addition to finding the mission to begin with. Recon’s mission, on the other hand, forbids you from taking any damage from the collapsing circle. I absolutely love these challenges as they threw an extra layer of complexity on the already daunting prospect of winning a match. Furthermore, sporting these skins tells the story of their acquisition to those around you, and that story is something other than “I paid for this.” Though victory is not a prerequisite for most, unlocking a character and winning in the same match felt incredibly good.",

        "Subtitle": "Fortunate Son",
        "Subheader": "By Vince Ingenito Posted: Mar 20, 2014 2:00 pm",
        "Content": "Infamous: Second Son is, in many ways, a large step away from the comic-book roots of its predecessors. Don't misunderstand – Second Son is very much an open-world superhero action game first, and an excellent one at that. Its flashy powers look and feel great in battle, and that’s really what  games like this are all about. But I didn't expect to enjoy the weightier, more realistic tone of the characters as much as I do. It’s a change that initially surprised me as fan of the franchise, but one that ultimately pays off. Despite failing to believably marry the player's moral choices with the protagonist's own sense of right and wrong, Second Son hits some big high notes in both character interaction, and most importantly, open-world gameplay.   It didn’t take long for Second Son's remarkable lighting to leave me staring slack-jawed at my screen. The power of the PlayStation 4 is evident in every street-side puddle reflection and in every swirling tuft of smoke that left my flaming hands. The city of Seattle is beautifully and diversely realized, but it never looked better than when I was blowing everyone and everything around me to bits. Serene city streets turn into fiery disaster zones with gleeful regularity, and both the before and after are great to look at, despite occasional stutters when the effects get out of hand.  While high production values are often a smokescreen for weak characters, Second Son succeeds here, too. Troy Baker’s motion-captured performance as our new Conduit, Delsin, remains believable whether he’s being a snarky, reckless jerk, or a plucky, bohemian do-gooder. He’s not universally likable, but the chemistry he has with his conservative, law-defending brother makes for some absorbing familial banter.  Delsin is a young man who, like so many others, is filled with equal parts anger and idealism, and the fact that he wields such overwhelming destructive power makes that inner conflict tense, and interesting. Sure, it’s well-covered territory, but Baker imbues it with a charm, and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey or overwrought. Add in the icy, iron-willed villain Brooke Augustine, and the result is a conflict that boils to a genuinely affecting climax.  Sadly, the rest of the cast isn’t as well-utilized. Supporting characters like the immediately interesting Abigail “Fetch” Walker are quickly introduced and brushed aside, with limited involvement outside of the two or three-mission-long arc that pertains to them. While Second Son’s individual beats and characters are well executed, the plot that strings them all together is frustratingly straightforward and limited in scope, depriving the bit players of the chance to make a meaningful impact on the core conflict.  Story quibbles aside, Infamous is about feeling formidable, and Second Son doesn't disappoint. Delsin’s four varied power sets turned every D.U.P. checkpoint into another chance to flex my super-powered muscles. From the explosive destruction of smoke to the swift precision of neon, each set feels strong enough to hang an entire game on, and strategically switching between them during  heated battles by draining power sources from around the city made me feel like an unstoppable force of nature. Skill trees offer more options than previous Infamous games, allowing you to either concentrating on one power or split your resources between multiple paths, and the unlockable powers differ based on your moral alignment as well. An evil neon user for instance, can make targets explode into novas of pure energy, causing chain reactions that can obliterate groups of civilians in seconds, while a benevolent neon user can slow time to a crawl to carefully incapacitate foes one by one with a series of exacting attacks. Not only does this variety keep combat fresh, but it creates a strong incentive to replay and experiment with different combinations. The streets of Seattle are flush with random karma opportunities and predetermined side missions, so you never have to look far for an opportunity to put your powers to good (or not so good) use. Downing mobile D.U.P. command centers was a particularly rewarding venture, offering up some of the most steeply pitched firefights, and doling out big skill point rewards upon completion. I happily lost hours wandering around and taking the city back district by district, becoming ever more powerful as I went.  Between scraps, I found Delsin’s nearly unfettered sense of mobility exhilarating. He speeds up the sides of skyscrapers, and soars across the Seattle skyline at your whim...once you get all the right power-ups. Until then, you’ll be leaning on the old-fashioned parkour from the previous games, but it doesn’t feel nearly as sticky or reliable as it has in the past. This led to a few frustrating situations where I couldn’t grab ledges that were clearly in reach. It becomes less significant as you expand your suite of traversal powers, put when everything else feels and plays so well, it’s hard not to notice. Something that sticks out even more however, is the state of the morality system. The red vs blue decision making comes off as woefully outdated, and disconnected from Delsin’s personal motivation of healing his injured tribemates. There’s nothing in the story that suggests that he’d ever be interested in killing innocent civilians, or that his police officer brother would be okay with it if he did, and yet you’re clearly incentivized to murder everybody you see if you want to make the most of your evil playthrough. Extremism is always rewarded with more power, and as such, there’s never a reason to partake in evil actions when you’re trending good or vice versa. This essentially takes moral decision making out of the equation, which is sorely disappointing for a game that attempts to place choice front and center.",

        "Subheader": "By Pete Donaldson Updated: Jan 18, 2012 6:58 pm Posted: Oct 17, 2011 11:00 am",
        "Content": "The problem with approaching any game with the scope of the Football Manager series is that you're never 100 percent certain that the snazzy new feature you're making 'ooh' noises at is one that's unique to this iteration, such is the scale of Sports Interactive's baby.  And with a game that has no figurehead to reclothe and no hi-res textures to polish up, how do you make the most detailed, no-statistics-left-behind management game even more complex? And is complexity even the end game?  I have a theory whereby the clothing and demeanour of the male model on the front of a Football Manager game dictates how revolutionary the title is. For example, in 2005 our man was wearing a functional padded jacket a la Harry Redknapp – a man who clearly dressed in a hurry.  And sure enough, that year was one in which FM was in a brutal race to the shelves with rival Championship Manager, after mummy Eidos and daddy Sports Interactive had gone their separate ways. Jump forward to 2007's box art and the game was rocking a Mourinho long woollen coat and tie combo.  The message: we're looking great and we know it. FM 2008, and our manager is now a little chubbier in the face, and the game similarly is fit to burst – this year sees the return of the Dutch national team, and a newly licensed Ligue 1.  On the box for last year's effort our man was decked out in high-waisted Simon Cowell slacks and in desperate need of a shave. Also, for some reason he's standing in the middle of a packed out stadium with a football under his arm, which looks a bit mental.  Having a bit of a breakdown perhaps?  Has success got the better of the gaffer?   Cleverly Football Manager 2012 is more in-depth than ever before, but is easier to get into.  We needn't have worried. The Football Manager 2012 dress is a masterpiece in the art of the Joachim 'Jogi' Löw-style school jumper and overcoat, a whole new approach to managerial fashion seen at the World Cup a year earlier, and with it comes a fresh take on the game itself.  The major advances this time round aren't necessarily ones that are apparent in day-to-day team management; the biggest addition is probably scalability of the whole experience – you're now able to add or remove vast swathes of club football at the click of a button.  No longer are you tied to the teams and leagues you selected when you started a new game, which for anyone who regards themselves as a bit of an FM aficionado is frankly mind blowing. Similarly the new interface expands and contracts when gifted a extra few pixels to play with – if you're lucky enough to be able to play games in something as high as 1680 x 1050, Football Manager has the wherewithal to slide in another couple of stat boxes for your perusal.  Last year's iteration made custom tactics a breeze; in 2012 you're offered the chance to quickly switch between three setups, with the game giving you instant feedback as to precisely how au fait your charges are with any given formation. Perfect if you want to play a certain style of football when you're at home, but need a bit more steel in midfield come away days, or when you find yourself a goal down.  You're now also able to make adjustments to your team's workload directly from the tactics screen itself – invaluable if you're the sort of person who lives for the 90 minutes on the field but isn't necessarily big on match preparation. This integration also enables you to make adjustments to your 'manager philosophy' on the same page. Such integration is indicative of Sport Interactive's overarching vision of giving the bedroom David Moyes' (manager philosophy: scream at ref until red in face, complain about lack of funds) everything they need in one place.  You're not alone in your quest for football-y success and every step of the way you can palm off some of the managerial head-scratching to any one of your coaches, allowing any member of your staff to pick strategies and starting line ups, be they specialised in defence, attack or even goalkeeping.  This leaves you free to become that Claudio Ranieri-style tinkerman you've always dreamed of.  Elsewhere, Football Manager has always had zonal marking in Football Manager but this year we've been gifted something you might call 'tonal barking'.  The way you address your players has fundamentally changed. You can criticise, flatter and scream at your ungrateful charges in several different ways now – some players will need a feather touch and some will require the more robust hairdryer treatment, but every step of the way you're given real-time feedback as to how your comments have been received.  You're also able to call meetings with your entire staff, players included, giving you a great opportunity to clear the air if you've just experienced back to back defeats, for example.   The new adaptive layout is smart and changes depending on the resolution and ratio of your monitor.  As is always common with Football Manager, the devil can be found kicking back and enjoying a lemonade in the detail. You'll now find that the days of the South American full back are numbered – any wide defensive players from that continent are now more than likely going to be wing backs.  Transfers are now slightly less headache-inducing too: if you know you're unable to stretch any further than a particular figure in wages you have the option of 'locking' that part of the contract down, meaning that agents have to find some other way of getting money out of you through loyalty bonuses and appearance fees.  Another gigantic leap has been taken with the tutorial system.  With a game that revels in depth, statistics and bar charts, even the most institutionalised fan might need a spot of hand-holding at times, and 2012's tutorials really are well put together.  The slightly frustrating side of Football Manager has always been the feeling of helplessness once the rot sets in – you're never exactly sure whether your work on the training ground has any effect when it comes to five past four on a Saturday, when you're about to return to the field two-nil down, languishing at the bottom of the league. But such suspension of disbelief is necessary in any role-playing game (in the purest sense of the word) where chaos and circumstance are all part of the charm.  This slightly uneasy feeling is still there in buckets, but is lessened slightly when you're able to instantly improve a player's morale by interacting with him, or asking another player to take him under their wing.",

        "Subtitle": "A simple racing game gets a few Ford cars to play with.",
        "Subheader": "By Ed Lewis Updated: Dec 13, 2018 5:54 am Posted: Nov 4, 2003 6:58 am",
        "Content": "Once upon a time, a writer in Russia came up with a book that he claimed would be his own interpretation of American culture. The result was a book that repeated the name \"Ford\" over and over again for hundreds of pages. True story. With the release of Ford Racing 2 , developer Razorworks has come up with the video game equivalent of that book. By taking a blank medium, in this case a basic racing game, and repeating the \"Ford\" name over and over inside it, it almost forms something like a decent game. In some places it almost makes it, but for the most part, FR2 will serve better as a promotional tool for the brand than an enduring title.  Of course, just having the name of the Detroit company just isn't enough, so FR2 has 35 Ford cars ranging from old trucks from the 50s and 60s up through different years of Mustang to modern concept cars. This is almost triple the amount of cars in the straight-to-budget Ford Racing , but it's still a paltry number of cars, especially since Ford has so many to choose from in their whole, you know, history of making cars. One thing is definitely true, though. The question of whether grandpa's old junker truck would stand a chance against a modern F-150 can be finally solved (possible spoiler: it can't).   Gameplay  So there's still a racing game here, right? Well, yes, sort of. But not really. The main mode of FR2 is the Ford Challenge mode where there are 34 challenges to unlock cars for use in the races (more on that sordid tale later). There are eight different types of challenge here, including standard fare like a race, which is what you would expect. There is also an elimination race where cars get removed at the end of the three laps until the winner is the only one on the course. There is also a duel challenge where each of the three laps features a different car that must be beat. Throw in the time trial and you have a beginner's set. To make things more interesting, there are a few different time challenges which are three slightly different flavors of the same thing.   There are three different types of racing challenge that focus on following a clean line around the track. The most ingenious one has an ideal racing line that follows the entire track. Straying from the track will effectively make the clock run twice as fast so going fast and staying on the line is key. This is an effective way of showing how to take turns. It's a good idea, but there are also two other challenges where the goal is to either drive between cones or hit hourglass icons to extend time. These usually follow the same line, and do the same thing, except that they don't handle straightaways very well. Hit a spot perfect for some leadfoot action and the objects start zigzagging across the road. It may add some extra challenge and some variety, but I would've preferred a series of the first racing line challenge to these kart-racing inspired challenges.  It may sound like this isn't so bad after all, though, right? These racing line challenges educate the driver about driving skills so that they can be better when it comes to the racing that's in the tile of the game, right? Wrong. With 34 challenges spilt between eight different types of challenge, the total number of challenges that are actually about racing becomes fewer and fewer. To make matters even worse, there's no way to pick a track a track and a car and race on it. There is a Quick Race option from the main menu, but this will drop the player into a random car on a random course. Sure, it's quick, but it's useless. Kinda like Malt-O-Meal. You just add water and heat it up and then you don't want to eat it any more. The only way to choose the course and car is by choosing the two-player race option. Since it's doubtful you'll be able to confuse someone else into wanting to play this at the same time as yourself, this probably won't happen too often.   Graphics  The graphics are just baby steps away from the PS One predecessor. The engine is solid and maintains a good framerate throughout, but that's because not much is being asked of it. The environmental geometry is basic and never opens up into any large areas. Even the views have been simplified to just two: front-bumper cam and right-behind-the-car cam. The former is easier to drive with, but a driver-seat cam would have been much better. That couldn't have been too difficult, but it's not here and it damn well should be.  One part of the graphics does deserve special mention, however, and that is the level with the lava creeping onto the track. The lava doesn't do any damage to the trucks ('cuz these are Ford trucks), but going through them does produce a thick cloud of black smoke. This black smoke didn't look special and really shouldn't get any special mention, but it is funny that the only penalty for driving through lava, which is really hot, is a puff of smoke.   Sound  The soundtrack to the Ford life is filled with horrendous rock and funk bands that sound like those bands you listened to in college. You know the ones: they formed just a few weeks before the big day and practiced a couple times, but never together -- yes, those guys.  The rest of the audio effecs have some unconvincing whines and growls that don't always sound like they came from the belly of a Detroit beast. We've definitely heard better and are willing to bet that you have too.   ",

        "Content": "One of the reasons the Wii gets such a bad rap from the gaming community is the extensive library of crappy games that clog store shelves. A lot of these games are based on licenses aimed at kids. When a kids' game manages to rise above the dumbed-down, stale gameplay of its colleagues, it's surprising, if not downright shocking.  Unfortunately, SpongeBob SquigglePants is not one of these games. THQ has slapped one of the most popular kids' franchises onto an unimpressive game, which requires an external peripheral for no good reason.  Last November, THQ introduced the uDraw tablet , a Wii-specific peripheral that could serve as an art tool in addition to a controller. Some of the subsequent games released for the peripheral, like Pictionary , have made smart use of the tablet. SpongeBob SquigglePants, on the other hand, feels like nothing more than a cheap attempt to move more product for the platform without really making use of any of its unique features.     SpongeBob SquigglePants is a mini-game compilation in the vein of the WarioWare games. Each \"nanogame,\" as THQ calls them, lasts no more than a few seconds and has the user completing one simple task, such as catching a hamburger or answering a phone.  These tasks are completed by tapping, flicking, pressing, or drawing on the art area of the tablet, or shaking or tilting the entire tablet. Completing large numbers of these games without messing up unlocks various pieces of artwork in the SpongeBob SquarePants Art Gallery.  Patchy the Pirate, a live actor from the SpongeBob universe, introduces players to the art gallery and offers commentary on their performance. I realize I'm not the target audience for this character, but I found Patchy so annoying, I audibly told him to shut up multiple times. However the worst thing about the character is that he will call players \"losers\" if they fail at completing their goals. I can't imagine many parents would be crazy about their kids being called losers by their video games. The mini-games are all right, even though they do get repetitive pretty quickly, and the sensitivity of the tablet makes the control a bit shoddy in some of them.  Additionally, once you've unlocked all of the paintings, there's nothing left to do but go back and try to complete the same games faster and without messing up. The only mini-games that were actually interesting were those inspired by classic games like Frogger, Breakout, and Asteroids. These mini-games actually made you feel like you were doing something other than madly tapping or scribbling.  But my biggest problem with SpongeBob SquigglePants is that there's absolutely no reason for this game to require the uDraw tablet. With the exception of a very simple drawing tool, all the mini-games could just have easily been controlled with the Wiimote. The tablet adds nothing to the experience, and is basically treated like a big DS touchscreen. ",

        "Content": "Unlike the Birdman’s games – or the one with actual birds in it – Skater XL is a serious and mostly authentic and grounded simulation of skateboarding and it innovates in a truly engrossing way with its nuanced and tricky two-stick control system. There have been times over the last several days when I’ve become deeply immersed in the process of learning a new trick and executing it perfectly on a cool line I’d found some place within the maps. However, playing on Xbox has exposed the fondly-regarded PC version’s secret: it’s heavily reliant on user-made mods to flesh it out. This has left the console version feeling extremely light on content at launch and, combined with some regularly occurring jankiness, the result is something that generally feels more like a tech demo than a complete game. Skater XL’s controls may initially seem familiar to Skate’s gesture-based brand of analogue stick flicking – and it’s true that there are some rough similarities – but mastering Skater XL’s controls is actually like learning a whole new language. In Skater XL, each thumbstick represents the skater’s corresponding foot. That may sound simple but sometimes it’s a bit like rubbing your belly with one hand while… braiding your own hair with the other. Even a straightforward kickflip requires you to pop the board with your back foot and then execute a properly-timed kick with your front foot. If you chuck a rotation in there, that’ll require one of the triggers. If you want to throw a grab on top of it all, that brings in the bumpers – and all of a sudden you’re squeezing your controller from all angles like it owes you money. This complexity may ultimately be a turn off for some, but I’ve quite enjoyed just zoning out and trying to perfect some complex skate tricks “ This complexity may ultimately be a turn off for some, but I’ve quite enjoyed just zoning out and trying to perfect some complex skate tricks. Things like this are often a simple button-push away in other skate games but would require a huge amount of practise in reality, and so they do in Skater XL. Overall I get the feeling the goal here has been to build a control system that attempts to mirror the finesse of foot movement that real-life skateboarding requires and, to a certain extent, that has worked. The granular control over grinds is particularly nifty if you move the sticks slowly enough not to trigger an ollie or shuvit. That said, it’s loaded with annoyances, too: the zone on the stick for performing manuals feels a bit too small, you can’t seem to turn more than 90 degrees on the spot without pushing off in the complete opposite direction, and sometimes my skater will bust an unwanted ollie before I’ve let go of the stick.  Tre Cool During my second morning playing I attempted a tre flip, which in Skater XL requires two similar yet slightly out-of-sync movements with each stick. I couldn’t get it. I just couldn’t remotely nail the timing, and the angles were beyond me. Skater XL was asking my monkey fingers for Moonlight Sonata and all they had to give was Mary Had a Little Lamb. At one stage I even noticed there’s an achievement for performing 10 tre flips in a row. I scoffed. It was never going to happen. But I made a few more attempts, and those few attempts turned into a few more attempts, and a few more attempts after that. Eventually I landed one. Then three in a row. Then 10 in a row. Skater XL’s controls are a bit of a wall to crash through compared to, say, an arcade skate experience like any Tony Hawk game out there, but because they ask you to practise and practise, there’s a quaint loop here that imitates the spirit of the real thing – or, at least, learning a real, physical skill – in a satisfying way. Try. Fail. Try again. Fail again. Try again, succeed, celebrate.  American Wasteland That loop, however, is all Skater XL has. There’s no campaign for its four pro skater characters or even a path through its five core maps or the three user-made maps from PC modders that have been curated and added to the console versions. There’s no ultimate goal beyond “go skate.” Each of the maps has a list of challenges you can complete but they feel a bit like a long series of tutorials. This may be enough for skaters who just want to noodle around, bust tricks, and experiment with the video editor, but for those accustomed to more substantial skating games I expect Skater XL may feel a bit like the part of a game you play while you wait for the rest to install. The high school level feels very authentic, there’s a faithful rendition of the West L.A. Courthouse spot, and the downtown L.A. map also features riffs on several iconic spots skaters will likely recognise, but they’re all completely lifeless. No NPC skaters, no moving vehicles, no multiplayer; just you. The visuals and bright and sharp and the menus are clean and unobtrusive, but the visual quality is a little uneven overall. There’s some great detail on some of the surfaces, in particular – like the benches and pillars of the West L.A. Courthouse spot bearing the scrapes and scars of a few thousand 50-50s – but certain things don’t quite stand up to the same level of scrutiny (like shirts clipping through pants or the fuzziness on props like cars). The Big Ramp level is fun in bursts, but there’s no denying that it undermines Skater XL’s focus on making you strive hard to perfect the fundamentals of straight street skating when I can bust out a successful backside 1800 into… a port-a-loo, by accident. There’s big rift between the gritty, harder-than-it-looks urban skating Skater XL wants to celebrate and the fact you can successfully land a double-900 from low orbit on flat ground without your ankles exploding, and then… skate off through the desert. It just doesn’t feel finished. There’s a halfpipe on the Big Ramp for transition skating, too, but it's unreliable and I find whenever I get into a groove I end up exiting the pipe or landing on the coping unintended and bailing. The bails aren’t particularly great, either; if skaters aren’t freezing their limbs in odd positions they’re regularly clipping through the environment. They can be hard to predict, too; sometimes you’ll pop off the same low rail half-a-dozen times and collapse in an unexplained heap all but once, and other times you can accidentally fall from a freeway bridge and skate away with no hassles. The audio is very good, however, and there’s a nice suite of honest skating sound effects. With the short soundtrack turned off there’s an almost meditative quality to the hiss of rolling wheels and scraping ply.",

        "Content": "Picture Lives ! did not impress me. That's what this game was called when Nintendo first showed it off back at June's E3 Expo 2011, and its lone demo station sitting nearly hidden among a collection of Mario Kart 7s, Kid Icarus: Uprisings and Super Mario 3D Lands seemed terribly out of place. I tried it, promptly got confused by the mess of odd content paraded before my eyes and came away so perplexed that I ultimately recommended that Nintendo just kill off the project then and there .  Now, five months later, the company chose not to listen to me. Picture Lives! has shipped into the 3DS eShop with a new name, Freakyforms: Your Creations, Alive!, and it's just as befuddling to me as ever.  The core of the experience is the creation of Formees. Formees can be anything you want, from odd-shaped animals to monster trucks, weird alien/bird hybrids to bodiless bouncing mouths. Like EA's Spore, this is a Nintendo creature creator that celebrates the absurd. The interface for constructing your personal Frankenstein beasts is an elegant one – streamlined, efficient and easy to navigate. But the body part options given to use in forming your Formees are all so awkward that your final creations can't help but look like oddballs.    The game does a nice job of guiding you through the process step by step, insuring that this one will be playable by all ages able to read its straightforward and playful instructions. The invisible narrating assistant also manages not to be intrusive to the point of annoyance, and his suggestions are genuinely helpful.  Things really get weird once your Formee is finished, though. It's then that your creation is dropped off unceremoniously into a side-scrolling \"meadow\" and encouraged to explore. This entails all variety of odd activities, from eating apples to giving piggyback rides to other Formees, from flying and swimming around the sky and sea to bashing bricks for coins in the style of the Mario games.  These exploration sequences feel a bit open and go-anywhere, like the developers were trying to capture a bit of the flavor of the Animal Crossing franchise. But then, oddly, these sessions are timed. You only have a few minutes to play at a time, after which you're forced to go back to the main menu. (After doing a few weird \"time's up\" things, like smashing open eggs for bonus coins.)  I still don't really get it. Though the final form of Freakyforms is certainly more fleshed-out and better presented than the limited demo that Nintendo showed off at E3, the game still feels kind of pointless. It's as if some game designer came up with the creature creation portion – which is fairly well done – but then didn't have anywhere to put it. So they surrounded it with this weird, tossed-together collection of disparate ideas that don't ever really feel like a cohesive game.    What's more, these flat, 2D creatures take no advantage of the 3DS' most prominent feature – and the game controls make directing your multi-winged, rainbow-colored, six-legged monsters feel like you're flinging them around with a slingshot.  Now, this being a user-creativity Nintendo game, I'm betting that Freakyforms will find an audience despite any misgivings I might have. Just as Flipnote Studio has inspired incredible video animations, just as Photo Dojo made placing yourself into a fighting game an easy reality and just as the Mii Maker has given life to great cartoon versions of friends, family and celebrities, so too will there arise a following for Freakyforms that'll no doubt fill the Internet with impressive creations (shareable by StreetPass and scannable QR Codes, no less). That subculture will come, and those players will love every minute of this.  But the key difference, I think, is in price. Those other three examples were all free giveaways. Freakyforms feels like it should have been too and I'd wager it might have been, had Nintendo not apologetically given away so many other 3DS downloads earlier this year. As a free download, the many different quirks contained herein could have been much more acceptable – the assurance of a widespread audience to share creatures with would have dismissed many of my fears. As a seven dollar purchase, though, I worry that not enough players will take the plunge on something so odd as to make the investment worthwhile – and those who do buy it will be left to manufacture monsters all alone.",

        "Content": "Ubisoft's Imagine brand has yielded a remarkable amount of titles that vary wildly in overall quality and design. On one end of the spectrum there are games like Imagine: Wedding Designer, a boring and soulless cash-in that serves no purpose other than to financially take advantage of uninformed teenage girls.  Then there are surprise hits like Imagine: Party Babyz, a mini-game compilation for the Wii that seemed to possess every characteristic we hate about games but actually turned out pretty darn well. These titles range in design from casual simulators to simple mini-game collections. Some offer epic, teen-novel quality narratives while others guide their players from one objective to the next with no context at all.  Then there are titles like Imagine: Ballet Star , an anime-inspired, story-based, social simulator, ballerina RPG. It's easily the most unique of all the Imagine games and is definitely worth a look for anyone even remotely interested in the world of ballet dancing, but it ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own ambition.  Ballet Star begins by allowing players to choose between three female characters each with their own unique personalities and dancing specialties. All three characters offer their own narrative arc, a feature that gives the game a moderate amount of replay value even if the game actually plays the same way no matter which character you choose. The ultimate goal for each of the three girls is simple, to become a professional ballerina by upgrading skills and competing in various ballet rehearsals and recitals every month.  The game itself is split into monthly chunks with their own story elements and objectives. There's quite a bit to do over the course of each month, so much so that new players will likely feel a bit overwhelmed at first. There are a lot of locations to visit and their purpose isn't made entirely clear upon first being dropped into the main environment. Some offer mini-games to improve your skills, some are necessary for learning new dance moves and participating in recitals and still more are just there to give your character a place to talk to other characters. With so many options it's easy to feel like you're missing something, like the game is offering too much freedom to the player at the expense of overall accessibility.  A few of the game's locations like the arcade, park and diner host a number of statistic boosting mini-games. These are your standard-fare DS challenges, from a glorified rock-paper-scissors match to a strength-boosting round of dodgeball. Each individual game corresponds to a particular statistic – strength, balance, sense, rhythm and teamwork – and successful completion is rewarded by the skill bumps necessary to pull off the game's more difficult dance maneuvers.  Another location of interest is the ballet shop, where players can spend in-game currency to purchase new clothes for use during practices and recitals. The nicer the clothes, the bigger the apparel bonus at the end of the routine. While this is fairly standard for any statistic-based RPG, Ballet Star also offers an additional bonus for sets of clothing that match the performance. Composing an outfit of peasant clothes and wooden clogs to play the part of the provincial damsel Giselle, for instance, nets 100 bonus points to the player. It's a smart little addition that encourages players to actually pay attention to the narratives being performed during the recitals, something most would probably skip over otherwise.  Once players have completed the individual objectives laid out for the month, it's time to participate in the dance recital. Recitals require players to quickly and accurately complete timed touch screen gestures using the stylus. There are four types of dance moves – spins, jumps, poses and steps – all requiring a unique form of input for completion. Spin moves, for example, task the player with tracing a shape onscreen before the time runs out, while step moves require specific screen taps in a predetermined order. None of these challenges are particularly difficult on their own, but the time in which to complete each gesture is extremely limited, rendering one stray or hesitant mark a failed dance move. This mechanic keeps players on the tips of their toes (or, rather, the tips of their fingers) at all times, effectively emulating the kind of pressure real dancers must be under while performing onstage.  These sections of gameplay are enjoyable for the most part, especially since they do really make the player feel the strain of dancing in front of a large audience.  But they're also extremely slow to unfold. After attempting each gesture, you're forced to watch the move be carried out on the top screen in a slow, drawn out animation before another gesture input is required. The whole process becomes disappointingly tedious when you consider that each gesture takes about two seconds to complete while the animations can last as long as ten or fifteen. I'll admit that most gamers considering Ballet Star for purchase probably will enjoy watching the well-animated character models, but it's hard to be impressed after the sixth or seventh time around.  Once the recital is completed the next month begins and the whole process repeats itself. The vast number of exploratory options and loose monthly objectives keep the game's progression from getting too stale or linear, but there's really nothing of interest for gamers who aren't enamored by dancing culture.  Ballet Star also offers a decent amount of wireless multiplayer options as well, allowing gamers to challenge their friends to the title's mini-games in both single- and multi-card play. None of the mini-games are particularly deep or unique, but it's a nice feature to have when you want to kill an hour or so on a long car trip.",

        "Content": "It's as if Hollywood wasn't doing enough to ruin our favorite TV shows. That's the only rationale behind Activision Value's latest game, Monster Garage , the highly touted Xbox version. Now, I've been a fan of the show since it first aired two years ago. The reality-TV concept married to a high pressure automotive engineering challenge is damned exciting to me, not just because of the open-ended mechanical problem-solving but also because of the incendiary personalities. Sadly, neither quality has managed to find its way into this clunky car-\"making\" game. What we're left with instead is a puzzle game that inexplicably straddles the line between Byzantine complexity and generic simplicity.  If you haven't seen the show, gear-head and all-around guy's-guy Jesse James (also seen in Tony Hawk's Underground 2 driving the retro-fitted Seque-chopper) is tasked with converting a stock car into an entirely different kind of vehicle. Viewers tune in every week to see Jesse and his team of five builders (a different group for every show) try to turn a Ford pick-up into a nut-shaker. Or turn a Mini Cooper into a snowmobile. The team gets $3,000 (and a few freebies) and seven days to complete each project. The real excitement comes from seeing the different build teams interact as they try to turn a bus into a pontoon boat. Should be fun, right?  Well, that's where the fun should start. But it's actually where the game careens into unparalleled idiocy. Monster Garage the game requires no more skill than watching the show. Early on you'll be limited to one particular schematic for your build. As the game progresses you'll be given the option to choose from a couple of different designs but, rather than wildly adjusting the game, these small options merely give the illusion that you're involved in the process of determining how to approach a given task. Added to that, a whole laundry list of things appear designed to ruin the interface, from the camera that gets stuck on stationary objects in the garage, to the check list that doesn't appear side-by-side with the parts menu.   Fall asleep in all new ways with Monster Garage. I also find it quite stupid that the seven missions here are all drawn directly from the television show. Now, call me an idiot, but it seems to me that the only people likely to be interested in this game are people who are already interested in the show. Basic logic, right? And the only reason they would be interested would be if the challenges were new . Since the game merely duplicates some of the well-known challenges from the show, I can only respond with a hearty ho-hum. Here goes: \"Ho-hum.\"  The terribly dull and uninspired building phase offers just as much freedom as the design phase but really ratchets up the tedium factor. The car sits before you in a 3D showroom. You can pan the camera around the car, focusing on the particular sections you need to work on. Using the Xbox analog stick and face buttons you click on menus to add parts. But the only other real interaction you'll get here is in screwing and unscrewing bolts and either cutting or welding pieces of metal. What's even funnier is that you actually have the option to skip the basic screwing and unscrewing of bolts, which is the only actual mechanical work you'll perform. This dumbs down an already basement-level of dumbness to below the likes of Barbie Horse Adventures , which looks damn interactive in comparison.   Like in The Sims the time values are all screwed up here and it takes far too long to complete certain tasks. Forget it taking an hour to go pee; I'm more concerned that a career mechanic takes five minutes to unscrew one nut. You'll be grateful at least that the sounds within the shop seem fairly realistic even if the labor commitments aren't. You'll also find that your own cursing sounds very realistic after a few minutes of playing.  Before you get too deep into the first day of your build, you should head to the parts catalog and you'll see a list of everything you need to buy. Simply buy one of everything you don't already own and you're set. Having the chance to pick from among different types (or at least qualities) of parts would help to make the game more interactive. And if that variance in quality translated into better vehicle performance or time saved during the build, so much the better.  Worse still, when you have a part that needs to be customized, all you have to do is click on one of your builder portraits. A complete list of every custom job the build requires is laid out before you and you'll merely have to assign builders to work on each project until they're finished. Again, fitting the right builder to the right project isn't even a consideration here, therefore eliminating the opportunity to think.  And, as I said before, the builders here have no real presence in the game. The show is full of disagreements and clashes. Here you just have the portraits of three random guys alongside Jesse James. They're not profiled like on the TV show or even introduced. Given that none of them stand out in terms of performance, it's probably best that you not try to get to know them.   Driving this car is about the most gameplay you'll get. Things would be bad enough if they ended there. But, as in the show, you'll have to take your new hybrid, Frankenstein car out for some trials to see if it stands up to real world use. (That's if you haven't managed to forget something completely idiotic, like not removing the front windshield of your rock climber therefore rendering it completely inoperable.)  Anyway, if you haven't arbitrarily screwed up your car (which is next to impossible), you'll have to take it out of the garage for some really basic driving challenges. Where the show presents a head-to-head challenge against another stock vehicle designed for the purpose. But the only challenge here is the inconsistent physics system.",

        "Content": "[Editor's Note: This review and score replaces our original March 2016 review. Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]   Each time I start up a new farm in Stardew Valley or return to my 100-hour save on PC, I feel like I’m going home. There’s a comfort in Stardew Valley that I’ve rarely found in other games. The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town, and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land’s mysteries. Whether you want to farm, fish, fight monsters, craft, mine, become everyone’s best friend, or do a little bit of everything, this farming adventure has plenty to offer. As we said in our original review , Stardew Valley “beautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements to create an intriguing, absorbing rural world,” and it’s only gotten better with each massive free update. Multiplayer, new items, buildings, farm types, events, and relationships give Stardew Valley an even better foundation and more of a reason to stick around past the coveted event in the third in-game year. The five new farm maps offer better focus for players than when Stardew Valley first launched. Each of the farms’ designs encourages different types of work – farming, fishing, foraging, mining, and combat. Each map’s activities are a relief from the grips of Joja Corporation, the cold, in-game company that encroaches on Pelican Town. Stardew Valley’s story is a simple, yet satisfying one. You inherit your grandfather’s farm after leaving the grind of your job with the Joja Corporation. Once settled on the farm, you then have to decide whether to support the local Joja Mart or rebuild the decaying community center. This conflict is the driving factor in the two or so years that span Stardew Valley’s story, but once that’s all completed, befriending and learning about the townspeople introduce other contained stories. The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch. “ The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch, though improving your relationship with each of them is rather superficial. All you have to do is give them presents they like twice a week to slowly earn their trust and affection. Giving them items they dislike can lower their affection level, so that at least encouraged me to try and figure out what each person enjoys most and to get creative with my gifts once I had some expendable resources well into my second year. That's right, Maru — you've been upgraded to pepper poppers. Despite the system’s simplicity, it’s still rewarding to learn about each person's dreams, passions, and challenges living in Stardew Valley. There’s a friendly monster who just wants to sell his merchandise to nice people, an artist who’s a little too shy to share her artwork, a bitter old man who’s hesitant to make connections, a scientist who studies the valley’s wildlife, and plenty other interesting folks.  After reaching certain friendship or romance levels, a special character scene plays if you catch them in the right time and place. The 12 romanceable characters have more scenes than others, and if you choose to marry one, they move into your home and actually help around the farm every now and then. It’s a welcome benchmark for the late game. NPCs are also the key to learning certain food recipes and crafting blueprints, so there’s value in befriending them beyond discovering their interests and personal conflicts. They’ll even send a small gift back to you occasionally. Sprouting Charm The changing of seasons in Stardew Valley is perhaps one of the most exciting events. Where summer has plenty of sunny days with a few useful thunderstorms here and there – with the right tools, you can make batteries with the lighting! – the snow-covered ground in winter prevents any crops growing outside, leaving the season’s activities a little more up in the air if you’re primarily a farmer. Every season has its own enjoyable pace that comes with the varying weather, crop types, NPC schedules, birthdays, fish, and fun festivals that keep things engaging. Each season runs for 28 days, so figuring out how to best spend them is a great challenge as each in-game year passes. By the time I reached the end of my second year, I felt confident in my daily routine and farming strategies. Farming isn’t overly complex, but the methodical nature of it is relaxing. It does take a fair bit of time in the first year to make enough money to get a good number of the best seeds, optimize your farmland, implement a watering system, and figure out a routine to take care of it all. Stardew Valley has levels for each main mechanic – farming, fishing, mining, combat, and foraging. Figuring out how to make the most of my days was a great challenge early on when I had a low energy meter for executing actions like chopping wood, tilling soil, and using the watering can, all without extra farming bonuses from my level. But even when that energy meter grew and I earned farming specializations, the difficulty and enjoyment I found in farming came from managing more land and deciding whether or not to process the farmed goods to make them into more profitable artisan goods or do something else with them entirely. For instance, I could sell all my grapes, cook them for my own consumption for energy and health, or I could save them to make jelly or wine with the craftable preserves jar and keg. Adding farm animals to the mix made for even more welcome diversity in my daily farming routine. Even with the big updates, Stardew Valley still has the mild problem of having so much to do with little explanation for how to do it, but there certainly is a joy to creating your own routines and discovering what works best for how you want to play. The in-game TV show Living off the Land provides good tips on mechanics and seasonal changes, but there’s not a whole lot of help on how to use some of the less straightforward items. For instance, a great new item picks up all products from goats, cows, and sheep, but I had to use a guide to figure out how to actually get it to work. On the other hand, new items like the planter pot make the early game a little easier. It allows the player to grow any plant per pot indoors regardless of the season, making it especially helpful for completing some early important challenges and requests from villagers that are easy to miss once a season ends. When I wasn’t farming or petting farm animals, I was foraging for the season’s natural goods (which is as simple as walking around and picking them off the ground) or fishing. Stardew Valley tracks everything you’ve had in your collection, so there’s definitely an incentive to try each main activity. Unlike farming, where you need to buy seeds to grow the next thing on the list, there’s a strict schedule to when certain fish are available, and some of them are incredibly difficult to catch. The fishing minigame itself is easygoing fun for the small fries but can be a little frustrating for some of the more rare fish. Still, that challenge is something I’m looking forward to conquering eventually once I craft enough of the right tackles and stock up on bait to lure the rare beasts in. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I’m very into it. “ Mining and combat, on the other hand, are a little more straightforward. The main mine has a handful of enemies that progressively get stronger with each of its 100 levels, and an additional cavern in an unlockable area houses even more difficult monsters and a seemingly infinite number of floors. Spelunking through the main cave is a dangerous endeavor early on, but obtaining better weapons and armor through the shop, chests, enemy drops, or through reaching new combat levels make it more manageable. The combat consists of simple button mashing to swing a sword, so pairing monster fights with the challenge of descending into a mine makes it a lot more fun and rewarding. The added difficulty of getting out of the mine before your character passes out at 2:00 a.m. also puts the pressure on for making it through the caves as efficiently as possible. Then, there are challenges from a group called the Adventurer's Guild to clear a certain number of the more popular monster types, so there’s yet another incentive to descend the mines to slay monsters. Oh, and there’s even more collecting involved as you mine old and strange artifacts that can be donated to the local museum for even more rewards. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I’m very into it. Regardless of their varying complexity, progression through all five skills is constant and rewarding. In addition to that basic fulfillment, just about every skill level has some sort of craftable reward and helps build your proficiency, or lowers the amount of energy required to use a tool. At skill levels five and 10, you get to specialize your character further by choosing professions that give bonus stats to certain actions. For example, a rancher gets more gold from animal products, but tillers sell crops at a higher price. That profession is refined further at level 10. I’m halfway into my third year in Stardew Valley and I still haven’t finished getting all my skills to level 10. Like with real life, there’s potential to do a lot in a day, but how it’s spent is entirely up to you. When you add someone else to your farm, though, those days can be a whole lot more productive. Ripened Co-Op Multiplayer is a fantastic addition to Stardew Valley that entirely changes how the game can be played. As expected, it helps you accomplish far more in a day if you have a cooperative farmhand, but does so without feeling too much like a cheat code. When a friend joins they get their own home (that the main player can enter and customize) and have to start a new character from scratch. This means they have low energy, weak starting tools, hardly any crafting recipes, and no skill perks. While it would have been nice to have the option to import a character with all its stats and upgraded tools – maybe even at a cost – starting fresh is the more balanced trade-off for having multiple people on a farm. You share money with up to three farmhands/friends who can meddle in your belongings, so it’s not entirely too difficult to get new players up to speed if you’re adding them to an established farm. Still, having to support others’ endeavors out of your pocket helps multiplayer maintain that balance between difficulty and power, and you can even change the profit margins for your co-op save if you feel like you’re making too much money. The updates added some incredibly useful but expensive items, so I definitely haven't complained about making more gold every day. If you’re starting a new farm together, I could see how splitting up each task could make that first challenging year easier to take on, and maybe even more fun. Someone who prefers to fish or mine could focus on that while someone who likes farming could look after the crops.  Farmhands have ownership over their cabin and relationships with NPCs in your game, too, which is an important incentive for helping out a friend on their farm since it gives them both a stake in your land and in the rest of your game, too. They can upgrade their home and even get married to your character or an NPC you haven’t romanced. It might be a bit tedious to have to go through the whole courting process again if you’ve already unlocked everything on your primary farm, but I appreciate that it offers a chance to start a new romance with a different character and to essentially establish a new life on a farm that can progress while you’re not there if the primary farmer chooses to play without you. My friend was incredibly helpful in kicking off the summer farming season as we toiled away for days leading up to it, calculating how many seeds of a specific fruit we’d need. Communication happens through a simple in-game text chat that’s equipped with plenty of great emojis. It ended up being an expensive season because of all the seeds I had to buy, but that investment my friend suggested has definitely paid off. Though his farming suggestions were helpful, spelunking with him was even more fun. Together we slayed plenty of monsters and got further in the challenge cavern than I had before. The easygoing nature of Stardew Valley also creates a wonderfully pleasant space to hang out with friends, which is a nice thing to have when so many multiplayer games are set in rather tense situations.",

        "Content": "When Pokkén Tournament came out on the Wii U back in 2016, we thought it was a great melding of the world of Pokémon and the fighting genre, awarding it an 8.0. Here’s what our reviewer, Darry Huskey, said last year:  “Pokkén Tournament takes a lot of what we know from old fighting gaming favorites and sticks them into a blender, delivering a unique take on both Pokémon and on fighting games in general. Sometimes all those ingredients spill over a container that’s a little too full - there is a surprising amount to learn beyond the beginner’s level, and that may alienate some Pokémon fans without fighting game experience. Pokkén Tournament does do a good job, though, at alleviating this bloat of mechanics with single-player modes to help ease into the action.” Full Pokken Tournament Review The same holds true for Pokkén Tournament DX for Nintendo Switch, which is essentially the same game as the Wii U version, just with five more characters, a Daily Challenge mode, a new three-vs-three mode, ranked battles online, split-screen local play, and all of the convenience that comes with being on a console/handheld hybrid. It’s fortunate that Pokkén runs and looks great as ever whether the Switch is docked or in your hands. The caveat is that if you’re playing in Split Screen mode the frame rate takes a dramatic hit, even with the enormous border around the screens. All 5 new characters and Mewtwo/Shadow Mewtwo are available from the start. “ The five new Pokémon that Pokkén Tournament DX adds are Croagunk, Darkrai, Empoleon, Scizor, and Decidueye, and it’s great that all of these characters and the originally unlockable Mewtwo and Shadow Mewtwo are playable right at the start. My personal favorite is Scizor, who has the unique mechanic of creating swords that float behind him and can either be called upon to enhance basic combos or used as tricky projectiles. I’m a big fan of air combos too, and he’s got a great launcher that pops the enemy into the air for a follow-up air combo. The Daily Challenge mode, on the other hand, feels tacked on without any real vision to it. Every day you get a new challenge that gives you a specific Pokémon, with a specific assist team, in a specific mode, with the promise of rewards in the form of skill points... which aren’t very useful. I’ve only gotten to experience a couple of these so far, but none have offered any interesting twists outside of having to win a fight using a character that I don’t normally use against easy AI bots that don’t require any sort of deep knowledge of a character to beat. Calling them “challenges” is a bit of a stretch. 40 Images The new three-on-three battles are neat, especially because they feel more like actual trainer battles in which your Pokémon faint, forcing you to throw out a new one to continue the fight. It seems strange that they weren’t in the Wii U version with how much sense they make here. All things considered though, the mode doesn’t dramatically change the way you play -- there’s no tagging characters in mid-match a la Marvel vs Capcom -- and all it really adds is two more characters on both sides of the arena.",

        "Subheader": "By Hilary Goldstein Updated: May 9, 2012 9:44 pm Posted: Oct 8, 2009 7:00 am",
        "Content": "Sony's Gran Turismo may still sit in the pole position among racing sims for many, but Microsoft is making a hard charge with Forza Motorsport 3 . Developer Turn 10 has adopted a new philosophy for Forza 3: Make it accessible. The result is a hardcore simulation racing title that can also be enjoyed by the most casual of fans. The career mode is easy to get into but offers an immense challenge; you can auto-tune every car or dive into a rich set of tuning options; and driving can be toggled between a simple point-and-go system and the most physics-driven sim every created.  Simply put, Forza 3 is one of the best racers ever made.  It starts with the cars, of course. Forza 3 has more than 400 vehicles you can take for a spin and the crazy part is, they're all unlocked from the outset. That's right, with the exception of a few cars available only to those who pre-order Forza 3, every car on the disc can be driven from the get-go. Sure, you'll need to earn some credits to make your purchases, but if you can drum up a million creds, you can take the Bugatti Veyron for a spin. If you've played racing games your entire life, this fact alone may just blow your stack. It goes against everything we've ever thought about racing games. You're supposed to start with crappy cars, suffer through a few hours of slow-paced driving, then graduate to a sleeker class of vehicle. Well, Forza 3 is throwing racing conventions out the window. Hallelujah.    Even if you were stuck with the lower-end cars for the first few hours, that wouldn't be as much of an issue with Forza 3. This game is fun from the outset. Though I've played dozens of hours with Forza 3, I still go back to the E and D class cars for some races, because there are so many good cars. This is largely due to the enhanced physics of Forza 3, which add a level of nuance not experienced in most racing games.  The tire physics are so greatly improved (and include real-time deformation), that you get a true understanding of how your car is reacting at every turn. With all of the driving assists turned off, you can feel the difference from one car to the next. And though you'll race the same tracks quite often, the experience changes from one car to the next.  Forza 3 Guide A helpful breakdown of car tuning and advanced racing technique. Read the Guide » I've always felt that you couldn't properly drive a car in a racing game with the assists off if you didn't have a racing wheel. While Forza 3 controls brilliantly with a wheel, I can assure you that you can play a hundred hours with just a controller and have no issues. Turn 10 has finally mastered the subtleties of the controller, allowing for better responsiveness.  If you're a novice or just like to take things easy, Forza 3 can satisfy your racing needs as well. Turn the different assists (such as traction control) on and you can still have a good time. The cars won't feel as unique, other than the speed, but you'll have no troubles being competitive. You can even go so far as to turn on auto-braking, which allows you to hold down the gas the entire race and let the AI brake for you whenever necessary. You can't throw green turtle shells at the other drivers, but it's pretty much Mario Kart at that point.   Mess up this corner and you can rewind and try again. The great thing about Forza 3 is that it encourages even the novice to take off the training wheels and drive freely with the assists off. A rewind function allows you to instantly skip backwards in five-second intervals during a race. Misjudge your speed on a tight corner? Rewind. Get tapped from behind and spin out? Rewind. Your cat jumps on your face causing you to crash into a wall? Rewind. There's no penalty for using the rewind and no limit. Some might call this a \"win\" button, but I think the rewind is a crucial addition to Forza 3. It can become a crutch at times, but it also frees you to kick the difficulty up to a higher level and get a true appreciation for your car.  Nothing bolsters that appreciation more than the visuals. Forza 3 runs laps around its predecessor. The car models have an incredible level of detail, including unique interiors for each car. I will admit that the interiors could look a little better, but overall the car models are spectacular. There's also full damage modeling on every car. You'll see dings and dents, fender benders -- you'll even see cars flip in the air. Those with a sharp eye will catch damage decals flipping on as the car makes contact with something. When you're in the cockpit view and you tap someone with the left corner of your bumper and, like magic, paint scrape decals appear across the entire hood, it can be a little disconcerting.   Each car in Forza 3 has its own sounds, so that sitting behind the wheel of a Porsche 911 is a much different auditory experience than being in a Mustang Boss. And you'll give thanks for the roar of an engine when it drowns out the mediocre music selection.  I felt Forza 2 was lifeless and without spirit. That is not an issue with Forza 3. This is a game that showcases speed and beauty. The cars are sexy, the tracks look great, and the game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second. The lighting isn't always perfect -- you can often see shadows dancing around the car in some odd ways -- and a few times textures didn't load on the track. Despite these issues, Forza 3 is one hot looking game.  Adding some extra personality is the advanced livery editor. As a novice designer, I can't quite see what is new about the livery editor from Forza 2, but those who are experts should find it easier to make high-end art. The good news for the many of us without artistic talent is that the Monets of the Forza community can post their designs on the new online Storefront.   In the Storefront, you can purchase designs for specific cars or decals usable on any vehicle you own. Prices are set by the designers, as are the number of copies for sale. If someone wants to make a unique piece of art and sell it for 30 million credits, they can. And if someone wants to sell a limitless supply of Autobot decals on the cheap, that is also their choice. A ratings system helps create a leaderboard for designers, which you can search to find the biggest stars in the community. You can flag anyone as a favorite so you can easily browse their store for the latest designs.  Tuning is just like art design in Forza 3. Can I get a \"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Willis?\" Seriously, tuning has been transformed into an artform and has similar functionality to liveries. Great tuners can create tuning sets and sell them on the Storefront. For those used to doing their own tuning, a word of warning. It is possible (even easy) to manually upgrade and tune your car in a way that actually worsens its performance. Basic tuning is easy to do, but delve deeper and you better know a lot about cars. That also means great tuners can help you maximize your car's performance better than you could ever manage.  And if all of that is too intimidating, you always have the option to auto-upgrade before a race. These upgrades will tune and upgrade your car to fit the track and race parameters. A great tuner can do even better by manually adjusting everything, but most gamers will find the auto-tune option good enough. The point of all of this is that the hardcore have a ton of ways to bury themselves in Forza 3 and the rest of us can click a few buttons and race. After all, isn't that why you bought a racing game?  The focal point of racing is the career mode. Forza's career mode is a series of seasons, each one longer than the last. The core career lasts six seasons, though you can continue on long after that. Each season has a bi-weekly championship race. These races are set for each season and are waiting for you every other Sunday. The rest of your career is completely dynamic.   Just like the one I own in real life. For the two weeks between each championship race, you'll choose one event. Each event is broken up into a series of races. Some as few as three, others can be around a half-dozen races long. You are always given three event choices, but these change based on a number of factors: The cars you own, the car you're currently driving, and the race types you play the most. No two careers are alike. Having played deep into two different careers, I've seen firsthand how much seasons can change. Through six seasons, you'll race 55 events. There are more than 200 events in total. After powering through about 50 hours of gameplay to \"beat\" the career mode, you still have well over 150 more events to beat if you want to master Forza 3. It's insane. Because there are so many events (and a great variety at that), it's very easy to have two seasons turn out quite differently.  Completing races earns your driver experience points. For each level you're gifted a car. Free. No strings attached. The idea is to reward you for playing and encourage you to try new cars. Unlike the seasonal calendar, the car gifting is not dynamic. That means everyone who plays Forza 3 gets the same cars. You're free to buy any other cars you want (remember, nothing is locked), but certainly you will get behind the wheel of many of your gifted vehicles.   Each season gets exponentially longer. Season 2 is about twice the length of the first season and season 3 is the length of the first two put together. By the time you get to season 6, you'll be spending hours upon hours to beat each event. For me, this began to become a bit of a drag. As much as I enjoy Forza 3, I found the final season to be a real struggle to complete. What was joyous and new in the earlier seasons felt tedious by the end. Granted, many will never play long enough to reach this point and some will be thrilled at the endurance races that await, but for me, it wasn't as rewarding as the earlier seasons.  Of course, you won't be driving alone. Up to seven AI drivers will challenge you on the tracks. Forza 3 uses Turn 10's Drivatar system, which basically teaches the AI based on a player's driving style. It creates a dynamic AI that learns from you. That was in Forza 2. What is new is the AI pressure system. Get behind an AI car and, depending on the driver, they might make mistakes. You may see the AI spin-out on a turn, take a bad line, or make other noticeable errors. There are times when I play Forza 3 and forget that the AI is controlled by a computer. Often it feels like I am racing against real people, which I appreciate immensely.  The AI elements aren't perfect, however. One of Forza's biggest drawbacks is in its AI settings. There are numerous assists to alter how your car performs, but there are just three AI difficulty options: Easy, medium, and hard. Even for average drivers, medium will quickly prove too easy. But, for me, hard can be really hard at times. It leads to too many races that are either far too easy to win or seem almost impossible to compete in. If Forza 3 had one more setting between medium and hard, it would be perfect. But it doesn't and, for me, it hurts the balance over the course of the career mode.   Racing in formation? That's classy. If, while playing through a season, you long for the company of other gamers, you can give the multiplayer a shot. Turn 10 went out of its way to offer a staggering level of customization. Multiplayer may be Forza 3's crowning achievement. This is the most robust multiplayer offering ever for a sim racing game. You can customize every aspect of a race, allowing you to easily create your own game types.  You can determine if cars get a head start, which car classes can be used for a certain team, and the qualifications for winning a race. This makes it very easy to set up a great game of cat and mouse, where the mice are trying to get to the finish line and the cats are out to take them down.  You can check out my recent look at Forza 3 multiplayer if you want more details on the customization options. ",

        "Content": "In the plot of the 1984 movie The Last Starfighter, a teenager is recruited to fight an interstellar battle after unknowingly proving himself worthy by means of a high score on an otherwise unassuming arcade cabinet. With the Mario Maker series, and now Game Builder Garage, I feel like Nintendo is doing something similar, but for future game designers. Game Builder Garage gives us a powerful collection of tools to create our very own games, but based on my output so far I doubt Shigeru Miyamoto will appear at my doorstep to invite me to join the team anytime soon. Even so, it’s impressive that by the end of Game Builder Garage's seven interactive lessons I already had ideas for half a dozen games and the knowledge of how to build them. Going in I was expecting Game Builder Garage to be fairly limited in the types of games you create, in the same way Super Mario Maker is powerful but limits you to creating… Super Mario levels. However, after completing all the lessons, which range from a simple single-screen \"tag\" game to more complex, fully 3D games, I see now there's almost no limit to the type of game you can create. Yes, you're stuck with the objects and graphics Game Builder Garage gives you, but how you build them and interact with them is incredible in its scope. Just as people constantly come up with new and novel ways to make Super Mario Maker levels, I fully expect to see some truly astonishing games being created with Game Builder Garage and its much more robust tools and feature set. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Its programming system offers a visual representation of all sorts of programming concepts: comparisons, subroutines, and conditional statements, all of which are presented through little creatures known as Nodons. And while it’s fairly technical, Game Builder Garage just oozes charm from its smart, fun writing and a finely honed edge that only Nintendo could provide. The engine is not without its limitations, naturally, but for the uninitiated, it's a great place to get started building real games. When your games are finished, you can share them with friends, although I haven't been able to test this functionality. (No, not because I don’t have friends! It’s just not out yet.) Simple Complexity Learning to program can be a daunting task, but Game Builder Garage's lessons are great at walking you through the steps required to build seven different types of games. Each lesson grows increasingly complex, but at no time during any of the lessons did I ever feel lost or frustrated. Your host, Bob, walks you through the steps for each part, introducing you to the Nodons responsible for each bit of logic or subroutine. There are Object Nodons for simple things like boxes, cylinders, and spheres. There are also Nodons for operations like arithmetic and counting, as well as the Boolean operators AND and NOT. There's no OR operator, but its existence is implied through the connections of Nodons. For example, you connect two different inputs to your AND Nodon (say, a constant like the integer 1 and a constant 0 to the same AND Nodon creates a de facto OR). It reminds me of old computer magazines, which often contained long programs in BASIC. You'd spend a few hours inputting the code into whatever crappy home computer you had at the time, and if you managed to enter a thousand lines of BASIC so you could make your screen turn a bunch of different colors you’d also absorb some programming concepts without you even realizing it. Of course, it's important to point out that Game Builder Garage is not going to directly teach you how to code anything outside of it. Instead, it teaches you how to build a game using a custom game engine. That said, while you're arranging your Nodons and their flows, you're learning how games work under the hood, and that understanding can translate to game design beyond Game Builder Garage's interface. Here's a quick example of how the Nodons work: You place a Person object Nodon on your edit screen. A quick glance at your game in action and yup: there's a person. But that person is just standing there, looking charming, unable to do anything beyond its simple standing animation loop. So you go back to the edit screen and call up Input Nodons. Drop the L-Stick onto your screen and drag its left/right connection to the horizontal connector on the Person object. Check back on your game screen and now you can control your Person object's movement. No muss, no fuss – and it only gets more complex and interesting from there. You can build a simple platformer or a complex, 3D maze complete with moving platforms, randomization, and giant aliens that shoot apples at you. “ The concepts don't quite translate 1:1 to actual coding, but doesn't mean Game Builder Garage doesn't have a robust set of tools. Quite the contrary: you can build a simple platformer or a complex, 3D maze complete with moving platforms, complex randomization, and giant aliens that shoot apples at you.  It just means you won't be pulling up Sublime Text or Notepad++ and debugging line after line of code. To be honest, I kind of wish there were a way to view the code involved with game creation, even if it's in some special Game Builder Garage programming language rather than a common game development language like C# or C++. It would help connect the visual workflow of the game engine with the concepts of writing actual code. I understand it would be messy, but for amateur coders like myself, seeing the code would be a great tool in helping me improve and understand some of the more complex logic involved. Which Entry-Level Game Design Tool Is Your Favorite? RPG Maker Series Super Mario Maker Series Dreams LittleBigPlanet Other (Hit the Comments) Answer See Results The lack of a requirement to learn the syntax and peculiarities of a coding language works in Game Builder Garage's favor. It makes creating games much more accessible, but it's still no walk in the park. If you're expecting Super Mario Maker levels of what-you-see-is-what-you-get, you're going to be disappointed. The Nodons are great at giving you a visual representation of the game you’re building and the pieces and parts that make it work, but its edit screen is largely an abstraction. It took me a little while to force my brain to think of how my games' various components will appear in the play screen rather than the edit screen. The lessons help out enormously in that regard. Test Your Skills After completing a lesson, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to 80 or more minutes, Game Builder Garage requires you to finish a series of puzzles before you can unlock the next lesson. It's basically a quiz of the concepts you just learned, and there are five different puzzles to solve that helped to cement them into my mind before they could be pushed out by something new. There are clues embedded in each puzzle, mostly hints about where to connect Nodons and whether or not you need to edit their properties. Any property not associated with the correct answer is greyed out, so you can't get hopelessly lost chasing down a wrong answer. Its entire presentation, from its adorable Nodons to your tutors Bob and Alice, is just so fun and brimming with personality. “ My problem with the puzzles is that many of them are solvable at a glance, while others… not so much. I like a challenge, but 10% of the puzzles required some manner of constant or numerical range that came down to educated guesses. With the other 90%, any time I was stuck it was something obvious I overlooked. Anyone who's ever spent an hour debugging actual busted code, only to find out you forgot to close a parenthesis knows the weird mix of relief and embarrassment when you finally figure it out. Its entire presentation, from its adorable Nodons to your tutors Bob and Alice, is just so fun and brimming with personality. The writing is also great, something I never thought I'd say about a piece of educational software, with distinct identities given to each \"character.\" I found game creation to be a challenging, but rewarding experience, and this is exactly the sort of software a parent raising a hopeful game designer should try. It's probably a little too complicated for a pre-teen, but with some parental guidance it's a phenomenal way to teach kids the basics of game design. Engineer Builds the World's Largest Playable Nintendo Switch 14 Images My one beef with building came when I messed something up, to a large degree. There's no bulk-select, so to delete two dozen Nodons meant having to select them individually rather than all at once. A way to select multiple Nodons would help enormously in copy-paste and mass-deletions. I guess the lesson here is \"don't mess up.\" As for me, a grown man with a little Perl, Python, C++ and Excel formula knowledge, I was charmed the entire time, and now I want to look into more robust game development engines. At the very least I can finish that RPG Maker game I started in 2015. For now, I'm content with my Game Builder Garage creation Super Falling Man Fantasy, which I'll be sharing with the world once I finish update version 2.0.",

        "Content": "D4 brings a bizarre murder mystery story to life, with all the pizzazz one would expect from Access Games, the studio behind cult classic Deadly Premonition. It casts us as David Young, a detective investigating the murder of his wife; driven by her final words “Look for D” and the ability to use certain objects to travel into the past. Can he find the killer? And can he change the past and save his wife? It’s a strong set-up for this new episodic series, and I greatly enjoyed this initial chapter, which includes a prologue and two episodes. The three or four hours of gameplay here is enough to lay the groundwork for the intriguing wider story, while also introducing a host of quirky characters and establishing a mystery within the mystery. D4 is a more contained whodunit than Deadly Premonition. Where that game was set in an open-world and was very much a horror experience by way of Twin Peaks, D4 is much more like a locked box: a mystery with few settings, driven by characters and dialogue, with only a handful of quicktime action sequences. With a peculiar design style and aesthetic, D4 is offbeat, obtuse, and charming at best, and horrible to control and crammed with wilfully superfluous elements at worst. And that’s kind of the point. D4’s vibe is all its own, with an intriguing story that very much lays the groundwork for twists and revelations in future instalments. That story sees Young use his newfound power to jump aboard an airliner just in time to interrogate a man who deals in a dangerous drug that’s implicated in his wife’s death. He represents his own mystery, as Young knows the plane will be struck by lightning and he’ll disappear, seemingly into thin air. A host of questions are left unanswered by the end, but there’s still enough closure to be satisfying. D4 boasts a slick, painterly aesthetic. So how does it play? Well, you’re a detective, so you spend most of your time talking to people of interest and thoroughly exploring each location, trying to learn everything you can. You have a couple of control options, but despite being initially designed to be played with Kinect (controller support was added later) I’d definitely recommend sticking with a controller. Playing this game with Kinect is like trying to drink a bottle of wine using your hands as a cup, when there’s a glass right there. Kinect is just too unreliable, and there are just too many things to interact with. Who wants to spend their entire game sitting upright on the couch with a hand in the air? It’s a shame D4 wasn’t just designed for a controller from the start though, as it’s still pretty clunky even when using one. The action sequences actually ARE better with Kinect, but there aren't many. Given the gameplay is driven by quick-time action and Heavy Rain-style gestures, and there are no real puzzles to speak of, D4 really does live or die on its characters and personality. Thankfully, it delivers.Young isn’t as eccentric a lead as one might expect – no split personality or coffee-grounds fortunetelling here - but he gets more interesting as you tease out details about his past life and relationship with his murdered wife. Elsewhere, we have a cast that runs the gamut from a grizzled law-enforcement officer to a flamboyant fashion designer with a romantic attachment to a mannequin. Perhaps the best characters, however, are the most enigmatic, like Roland Walker, a towering giant in a crisp white suit, medical mask, and perpetually cocked head. He speaks in slow, drawn-out sentences and can only be seen by Young. The Twin Peaks influences most certainly remain. Duncan and Sukey play several fun roles within D4. Each episode is essentially linear, but also quite dense. There are secrets to find, reading material to absorb, countless objects to interact with, and numerous sub-cases that open up more conversational options. A great deal of this is tangential at best, but I found it hard to resist the lure of trying to unlock every line of dialogue, find every medal, and ‘observe’ every interactive item within the world. This last element is a particularly neat inclusion. If you hover the cursor over something before choosing to interact with it, short, often-pithy observations from Young pop up around it, providing further information and injecting humour into moment to moment play. There are other nods to his prowess as a detective, including an alternate vision mode – Batman’s Detective Mode, essentially – which lets you see objects and people that can be interacted with, as well as highlighting certain clues. It’s a good, quick way to ensure you’re not missing anything, and can be recharged by quenching Young’s thirst. You'll spend a lot of time observing stuff. A more bizarre inclusion is stamina. Pretty much every object you interact with uses up stamina - whether that’s turning on a faucet, opening a door or reading a magazine. Want to top it back up? Eat! It’s classic Access Games - a system for the sake of a system! Game director Swery and his team seem to be poking fun at the conventions of gaming: the need to quantify and limit things. Most amusing of all, they ultimately have no real meaning, given you’ll always have plenty of credits to buy any food and drinks required. You could absolutely say the same thing about the ability to change character outfits, or the medals hidden about the place – they’re an arbitrary treasure hunt, there without context or acknowledgement, because hey, games need collectables, right? Statement or not, in the end I couldn’t help but enjoy the superfluous elements – they just add to the oddball texture of D4. Pictured: oddball texture.",

        "Title": "Resistance 2 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Humanity's darkest days are Insomniac's finest.",
        "Subheader": "By Jeff Haynes Updated: May 12, 2012 9:30 am Posted: Oct 28, 2008 7:01 am",
        "Content": "It must be a daunting prospect to follow up a critically acclaimed game that became a Greatest Hit.  The same could be said of following up a story that featured the infection and obliteration of Europe and most of the UK by alien creatures.  Fortunately, Insomniac loves a challenge, and they've been hard at work trying to best the adventure of Nathan Hale from Resistance: Fall of Man.  In case you were wondering, they've managed to succeed handily.  Not only is Resistance 2 an improvement in all facets of the game, it dwarfs the considerable action of the first title in the series.  The original game was a bleak alternate history tale of the devastation of Europe, not by the fires of war from a Nazi regime but by the invading Chimera, a strange alien race bent on the extermination of the human race.  The sequel picks up immediately where the original game left off, bringing Nathan Hale from the decimated territory of England to the safety of the United States, which was essentially the only remaining area in the world without Chimeran infestation.  At least, it was.  Two years after Hale's arrival in America, the Chimera launch massive coordinated attacks against cities in the USA, obliterating entire cities, killing thousands of civilians and converting others into shock troops to be used against the rest of the population.  As bad as things once appeared in Europe, they suddenly seem to be much worse in America.   Check out the Video Review here (HD available). Fortunately, Hale joins the SRPA, a secret governmental agency that deploys super soldiers known as Sentinels into battle.  Sentinels are much more than their name implies; these warriors have blood infused with strains of the Chimeran virus, giving them heightened abilities like super strength and health regeneration. America will need all of their abilities, because new monsters have been roaming its cities, forests and waterways. But can a squad of Sentinels uncover a way to repel the Chimeran hordes?  Will this be the last days of humanity, and just what will Hale's role be in the impending battle? Questions like these run rampant throughout the single-player campaign, which is a bit shorter than that of the original game (about 10 hours spread across a prologue and seven chapters), but no less complex or lacking in its depth due to the information revealed to Hale throughout the game.  In fact, it feels a bit tighter and faster paced than Fall of Man thanks to the action of the game and how information is revealed. Elements such as the Cloven from the original game, the Chimeran infection, and even the connection of the ARG Project Abraham and its connection to Resistance 2 are explained over time, and you do wind up gaining a large sense of what's going on within this grim universe.  However, for as many secrets that are discovered by the player, it seems as though just as many, if not more, are left unanswered.  This brings up one of my primary issues with the story, which is that I feel like it needed a narrator with some kind of perspective on the events of the mission like the first one did.  While Rachel wasn't omniscient, she did manage to tie together a lot of elements that weren't fully covered or highlighted in your missions.  By contrast, Resistance 2 is very Hale-centric, and focuses much more on his actions and what he wants to do.  That's fine, but his motivations behind what his decisions are or why he chooses to act a certain way or go to a specific location aren't fully explored.  As a result, some elements of the story aren't fully cohesive, and a large number of questions are left unanswered, which could potentially confuse players until the hypothetical Resistance 3 eventually is released.   Okay, who invited the T-Rex? For example, players are introduced to a number of supporting characters that comprise Hale's squad of Sentinels.  During one mission, you're introduced to some personal details about a particular soldier, which seems rather pertinent to the mission and plot at that moment, but it's quickly dropped and not addressed again.  Even though collectable intel fills in a few pieces of info that's left out, you really wonder just what the effect of exploring that side story would have been, or how that might have affected Hale or his squad or changed the action in the mission in any way.  Instead, the moment is lost, there's no reflection on it, and you feel somewhat slighted.  However, the story issues (which are arguably a minor or subjective problem) are overshadowed by the considerable elements that are marshaled together for Resistance 2.  The first game was well known for its atmosphere, tight corridors and its surreal environments.  All of that has been maintained, and even augmented.  For instance, it's extremely strange to walk into the town of Twin Falls, Idaho, and see the entire place covered with flesh pods, which obviously contain the unfortunate remains of the townsfolk. When one of your squad mates remarks that seeing the entire thing makes him miss conversion centers, you can't help but agree with him. But eclipsing this is the sheer scale and scope of the game, which is nothing short of epic. In every single level, there is at least one moment that will make your jaw drop, such as the absolute devastation of Chicago and its total infestation of Chimeran creatures.  The same can be said of the various \"monsters\" that you'll face off against, many of whom tower over the battlefield thanks to their size.  The giant Goliath walkers in the prologue are one thing, but when you first witness the dimensions of creatures like the Kraken or the Leviathan, it's definitely one of those things that gives you pause (as well as a sense of accomplishment when you defeat them).   The huge battles that erupt across the various levels will give you an adrenaline rush.  While the scale of the battles in the first game was large, the numbers present on screen at one point in time is simply incredible.  You'll find yourself and a dozen or more soldiers squaring off against twenty or more drones, a number of Chimera, and a couple of turrets, all firing bullets at you.  Facing down these incoming attacks can be daunting, but when you throw in the fact that the frame rate is rock solid without a hiccup, it's a pretty impressive feat that brings you into the action of the firefight. What also stands out is the fact that there are sections where you'll feel as though you've been through a massive battle -- after you and your squad have blasted hordes and hordes of monsters that descend on your position, you'll wade through the bodies of the fallen enemies that litter your path.  Details like this help to convey the situation that this is a larger cataclysmic battle in humanity's last days. Fall of Man was eye-catching in its battle sequences, but Resistance 2 blows it out of the water.  Part of this is due to the AI, which is solid for both enemy and NPC soldiers alike.  In Resistance 2, the kinds of Chimera that you'll face off against will force you to approach a fight with different tactics, because they will attack you in different ways.  Once again, Hybrids will team up with other soldiers, toss grenades or attempt to flank your position.  Spinners, on the other hand, will charge forward and try to overwhelm you with large numbers and powerful melee attacks.  Additionally, the game will frequently throw thirty or more of these beasts at you at one time, forcing you to quickly react and adjust to incoming strikes. Luckily, you're not forced to find a corner and face this threat alone.  The NPCs in Resistance 2 are just as smart, returning fire at enemies and frequently eliminating some enemies for you, including some creatures that you hadn't seen coming until almost too late.  Your Sentinel squad in particular is extremely skilled in this manner, targeting some creatures and blasting many of them that try to surround your position as you focus on the beasts charging directly at you.   That is one unhappy lizard. Of course, helping you eliminate the Chimera that foolishly stand in your way is the considerable weaponry at your disposal.  Insomniac has always provided creative weaponry in their games, and Resistance 2 is no different.  While you'll find a number of old favorites, such as the Carbine, Bullseye and Augur, there are a number of new weapons that are just as effective at eliminating Chimera.  For instance, the Magnum is a great weapon that packs a significant punch with each round fired, but its true strength lies in the alternate fire, which explodes the bullet and injures nearby enemies.  The Marksman is a rifle that can be used as an effective sniper rifle, although it fires off three rounds in quick succession.  However, it's also sends out an electrified orb that shocks nearby Chimera, allowing you to fire a few rounds into them. There are even new grenades, like the Spider Grenade, which emits tendrils along a surface that explode into flame, allowing you to destroy large groups of enemies.  Needless to say, you'll probably find a new favorite weapon or two in this arsenal, and you'll wind up unlocking more as you beat the game.  While the single-player experience is a great tale with an epic scope, it is equaled, and perhaps surpassed, by the multiplayer modes, which are perhaps some of the best I've ever played, and I'm particularly picky about my multiplayer.  The first mode that's included is a cooperative mode, which allows up to 8 players to leap into a game and explore the world of Resistance 2.  However, you're not playing as Nathan Hale or as one of his Sentinels.  Instead, you're part of the Spectres, a separate military faction tasked with tracking down and finding Gray Tech, items held by the Chimera around the world.  The co-op mode missions run parallel to the action of the single-player campaign, and help to point out that Nathan isn't the only one that's fighting this war against the Chimera; other humans are risking their lives trying to defeat the invaders as well. (Incidentally, Gray Tech is also vital because you'll be able to use these items to unlock additional missions as well as gear that can be used to outfit your characters.)   Just hope you can get in without being seen. Players are given a choice between three different classes, each with their own abilities and traits.  However, players aren't restricted to a particular class, and can switch at any time they wish, including during a match. The Soldier is the tank of the squad, equipped with a chain gun that projects an energy shield and packs more health than any other class.  Spec Ops are the damage dealers of the group, and while they have less health than others, their Marksman is particularly effective in wiping enemies out.  They are also the only class that can resupply soldiers by throwing out ammo packs.  Medics are the final class, using their Phoenix weapons to drain the health from enemies and convert it to healing blasts from their weapon.  They can also resuscitate party members faster than any other squad.  Based on the class chosen, players receive experience points depending on how well they perform the functions of their class.  This means that while everyone can receive XP for damaging enemies, soldiers will gain more for protecting troops, spec ops will gain more for resupplying troops and medics will gain more for reviving fallen troops.  These points are important, because points will eventually translate to higher rankings as well as unlocking new weapons and Berserk powers.  Berserks are specialized abilities that are tied to a particular class, and can be triggered when a player has gained enough experience points to fill a meter, which will slowly drain when the power is active. For instance, Soldiers can trigger Ironheart, which will reduce the amount of damage taken as long as the Berserk is active.  The Ring of Life, by contrast, allows Medics to set down an area that will constantly regenerate health of any allies in its proximity.  If a player frequently performs their job, they'll continually refill this meter, allowing them to try to swing the tide of the battle in their favor. That is an extremely important factor when it comes to the co-op mode, because the game takes a dynamic approach to play.  Initially, you'll be given an objective and based on how you're doing, the levels of each class in your party and the number of players in a match, the game will scale the action accordingly.   For example, if you find yourself playing a split-screen co-op game with one friend, fights will be easier than if you move in with seven other players and are surrounded by sixty enemies or more at the same point.  But on top of this, you'll also discover that the objectives will dynamically change as well, making each situation play out in a different manner every time.  What's more, as you blast through each checkpoint, you'll inevitably go up against some elite versions of these creatures, each of which hold more health than a standard Chimera and can inflict more damage as well.  But even outside of the scaling action of the cooperative play, the mode truly embeds a sense of working together with the other players in your squad, because it's not possible to survive this mode by going commando.  Each player is forced to rely on the other skills of their party mates to survive, but the one thing that I've found in playing a number of multiplayer matches is that anyone, from a newcomer to a seasoned veteran of the mode easily falls into a specific role and gets a hang of the gameplay, making it one of the most accessible multiplayer modes around.   The scale of Resistance 2 is phenomenal. The competitive mode is also just as solid.  Sure, Resistance 2 features many of the classic game modes that you've come to know and love in multiplayer matches, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag (known as Core Control in the game).  However, it's Skirmish mode where the mode sets itself apart, because the game will feature up to sixty players on scalable maps without any noticeable lag or technical hitches.  Skirmish mode is objective based just like the co-op mode, with dynamic goals assigned to the six squads of five players each for the Human and Chimeran sides.  These will cover a number of objectives such as controlling a particular node, protecting a specific location or eliminating a priority target on the other side.  Rival squads on the other side will be tasked with stopping you, so you'll always have some kind of opponent attacking you and your allies.  As time starts to run out in a round, you'll find that the objectives will start to funnel everyone towards a central point for overall domination of the map.  This is where the largest battles break out, and also where the action gets most intense, which only serves to boost the level of fun to huge levels. Toss in leaderboards and lots of other multiplayer features, including the MyResistance.net functionality that will track stats in real time while also giving a number of social networking features, and you have a title that will expand both replayability and community.  While the game is phenomenal in a technical and visual sense in the terms of its scale and number of enemies on screen at once, there are some weird technical issues that crop up here and there.  For one thing, some of the textures are noticeably lower resolution than others, and there's a lot of texture pop-in and screen tearing that will crop up here and there as you move through each environment.  What's more, you'll find some strange instances where monsters may twitch after they've been killed, or limbs of some creatures that have been blown off will still remain standing as if connected to some invisible body.  It's a strange thing to see what would appear to be a mannequin limb.  There are also some clipping issues that will crop up.  Given the scale of the game, many of these issues are understandable, particularly given the fact that there is a solid frame rate throughout, but they do still stand out as a problem to be found within the game.   Battles are large and between multiple onscreen characters. Sound within Resistance 2 is much stronger, with solid voice acting throughout the entire game to immerse you into the game action.  But much more than the voice acting of Hale and the other Sentinels, the ambient sounds within the game draw you into the experience of Resistance 2.  Perhaps the best example of this is nearing a flesh pod in one of the cities or towers in the game.  Initially, you'll hear some growling or rustling inside the pod, as if an animal was trapped inside.  The gestational sounds of the creature are truly unnatural and even unnerving to the ear.  However, what you'll find is that the loud noise associated to the explosion of these beasts in a slimy shower of blood and gore is disturbing, but quite satisfying.",

        "Content": "Traditionally, some of the best stuff in an RPG is the combat. The tactical decisions, crunching numbers, the strategizing, conserving strength for future encounters. But what's left if you take away character control and just about everything but crunching stat numbers and filling in the map? You get Loop Hero, and it turns out to be a game full of compellingly unique ideas and a weird fantasy world that demands attention. There's nothing quite like this strange combination of idle game autobattler with roguelite deckbuilding and puzzley tile placement. This exploratory experiment drew me in so deeply with its buffet of synergies and clever strategies that I lost track of time while playing more often than not. I only escaped because once its stat-building puzzles are solved there’s not much more to it. Before we even get to its strangely hypnotic and unorthodox gameplay, it has to be said that this is the most excellently surreal apocalyptic fantasy setting since Dark Souls . Loop Hero’s world is ending; nobody can remember things anymore, so those things are disappearing. Even abstract concepts like knowledge and permanence are vanishing into the void. It's a delightfully unsettling, disorienting place where even the elaborate pixel art portraits of the bad guys aren't sure what's going on. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Everything is forgotten except, of course, your lone hero , who walks a circular path through the void, fighting monsters and — crucially — remembering things before coming back to a campfire to rest. You have strange, dreamlike conversations with the people and creatures you meet, from bandits unsure why they're stealing to goblins who have somehow remembered themselves right into existence. The conversations and unlockable tidbits of lore are wonderfully meandering oddities. This is the most excellently surreal apocalyptic fantasy setting since Dark Souls.The map is represented with charmingly simple pixel graphics for the loop itself, which begins as a featureless, angular path through the lonely darkness. It’s inhabited only by your hero – little more than a 4-bit blob of white pixels – and a handful of bouncing green bubbles representing basic slime blob enemies. The art in fights is more detailed, showing 8-bit warriors slugging it out with basic attack animations, though like a 1990 RPG the sprites don't vary with changes in weapon or as enemies level up. The correspondingly retro music's good, too, even if a few tracks play a bit too often for the couple dozen hours Loop Hero will likely take you to play through. In those first few minutes you won't do much, quite literally, as battles are hands-off. Once you're in a fight your fate is controlled by your and your enemies' Attack Speed, Defense, and Damage stats, with a dash of whether or not the percentage chance gods give you more Crits, Counters, and Evades than the other side. This even goes for boss battles : it’s very strictly your stats vs theirs. So for the first few uneventful loops, well, it's a good time to fill your water glass or grab some snacks in the kitchen. But Loop Hero soon gets you occupied and challenged – and this is where the ability to pause between battles becomes essential. As your hero fights they earn cards representing map tiles among their other loot, and the conceit is that placing these tiles makes the hero “remember” that features like forest groves, mountains, villages, rivers, and more were actually part of the world all along, restoring them to reality. The balancing act is between adding useful tiles and not overwhelming the hero with new enemies.However, along with the benefits that those tiles bring (largely minor things like boosts to attack speed for forests or a town that restores some HP when your hero passes through) come corresponding tradeoffs. Beasts inhabit the woods, vampires come down from their castles, skeletons roam the graveyards, fishmen emerge from rivers, and gargoyles fly in and land just about anywhere. I found the balancing act between adding useful tiles and not overwhelming my hero with new enemies to be one of the best challenges in Loop Hero. Watching the map go from blank slate to overwhelming collage is a rewarding sense of progression that at least somewhat makes up for the lack of customization in your character. That said, the muted palette isn't going to be to everyone's tastes, nor is the chunky pixel font all of the text and stats appear in. (Which you can change, thankfully, to something easier on the eyes or dyslexic friendly.) What is best in RPG life? Combat Story Character/Loot Management Exploration Other - Tell Us in The Comments Answer See Results The loot that drops in battle is a big part of what keeps you busy: while it’s fairly robotic early on, you soon have to stop and think about which stats are best for your class. Does your Warrior want to buff his automatic health regen or his vampirism to gain health with every strike? What stats will your Necromancer sacrifice for the ability to summon an additional skeleton into their posse of the dead? You’re often swapping out one sword or magic ring for a shiny new one, but this is where Loop Hero leans too hard into randomness: If you don’t get the weapon drop you need for a couple of loops you're just out of luck as your damage doesn't keep up. I never once got a piece of gear so cool that it made me change the plan I had going in and build around it.That, and the only thing about loot is stats, stats, and more stats. There are six to eight for each of the three classes, and that severely hurts replayability, even when you look at the special abilities a class gets on levelling up, because you can't rely on any one stat to show up in the constantly-moving treadmill of random gear. I never once got a piece of gear so cool that it made me change the plan I had going in and build around it. Your biggest angle of customization is in Loop Hero’s roguelite-style progression between expeditions when you choose which of your unlocked map tiles you bring in your deck, and how those tiles relate to each other by synergizing into new forms. For instance, a three-by-three cluster of nine mountains transforms into a huge peak, and a town will give you more health if it has wheat fields adjacent. Because you have so little control over your actual hero, much of mastering Loop Hero is about searching out these bonuses, deciphering the way that they could benefit you, and figuring out the optimal combination of terrain for each of the three hero classes. It is a remarkably simple set of rules, and that’s a big part of what's good about Loop Hero. Place tiles, equip gear, get loot, go to camp, repeat. At the same time, that simplicity wore on me when I binged for hours at a time: there's a certain amount of grind you have to do in order to progress. I did expeditions fairly often not with the goal of fighting and defeating the boss, but just to repeat the same combos a few times and gain resources so I could retreat and purchase a critical upgrade back home. That just feels anticlimactic and low-stakes. It is a remarkably simple set of rules, and that’s a big part of what's good about Loop Hero.Each time the loop takes your hero to the campfire you can retreat back to your camp with all of your gathered resources (as opposed to a mid-loop retreat or death, which leaves you only a fraction of your haul.) You build up the camp over time, adding new buildings and people. This gives you the little incremental upgrades you need to progress and beat the boss of each act. You might carry a farmer's scythe to get more food from the fields you pass, a silver necklace to reduce damage from vampires, or build potion racks so you can bring more healing with you on the journey. (Also, though the developers have promised a fix for this soon, you cannot currently save your progress mid-expedition – quitting out and restarting puts you back in your town as though the run had never happened.) The thing is, when I call those upgrades incremental I really mean it. They’re simple, straightforward and, frankly, bland. You get more health, more damage, more attack speed. They don't shake up how you play other than unlocking the two additional classes, which happens early on. Loop Hero's biggest fault is that aside from the scale of the fiction and the ingenuity of the base concept it's not ambitious or creative in the details of its design. It doesn't provide variety or shake things up often enough to avoid becoming stale.

        "Content": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater put the alternative sport videogame in the spotlight. Countless imitators have popped up through the years, but until recently it carried on as the premier franchise. Iteration after iteration saw it slowly fall from grace until Electronic Arts stepped up and took the lead with Skate. Rather than continue on in a head-to-head competition, mega-publisher Activision took a step back, some time off, and decided to reboot the franchise. Inspiration from Wii Fit and its own popular Guitar Hero series has resulted in Tony Hawk Ride , a US $120 game that comes with a fancy skateboard peripheral. The idea? A more immersive skateboarding game that would ride the recent wave of hit games featuring their own custom controllers. The result? An expensive proposition that neither casual nor hardcore gamers will get much out of.  Tony Hawk Ride is a vastly different beast from past games in the franchise, and that should be readily apparent from the moment you see it on store shelves. You can't use a traditional controller. Instead, you'll have to get up off of the couch and use a custom controller shaped like a skateboard. This board is covered in sensors that detect which way you're leaning, whether the nose or tail are raised, or even if you're reaching down to mimic a grab. It's quite sturdy, too, so you don't have to worry about kids breaking it.   In theory, playing Tony Hawk: Ride should be fairly intuitive. Brush your leg along the ground next to the board and your character on screen will push off to gain speed. Raise the nose and you'll do an ollie. Raise it half-way slowly and you'll do a manual. Variations and more complex tricks can be done by twisting the board or leaning forward or back while in the air.  Reality is a little less kind. Ride can be played on three different difficulties. On the lowest, called casual, the game does most of the steering for you. Players only need decide when to jump and trick. On the higher levels, steering and other assists are turned off. The trouble with Ride is that it feels like it plays itself on casual and the learning curve for anything higher is far too steep.  And when I say it feels like it plays itself, it really does. Face away from the screen or simply kick the board around on the ground and you're just as likely to pull off big tricks on the lowest difficulty setting. Toss the controller around like a mad monkey and you might find yourself with a high score. Doing a specific move, however, is frustratingly difficult. That turns the game, at least on casual, into the skateboarding equivalent of button-mashing.   Build up a style meter and you can pull of bonus crazy tricks. Once you turn the difficulty up, you begin to see the failures of Tony Hawk: Ride. Steering is incredibly difficult, as is pulling off moves regularly. Lose your balance and lean to the side just a little and you'll start spinning in circles, bouncing off of pieces of the environment and failing challenge after challenge. It pushes the sensitivities to the extreme and makes the transition from casual to anything else punishing and, well, not fun.  The more you play, the more you'll also begin to notice that the physics and collision detection aren't up to speed – I once watched my skater go straight through the wall of a half-pipe and then fall through the world. Other times you'll watch your skater's head slide right through a cement wall. The camera has plenty of difficulties, too, once you take the game off of the casual rails. Ride simply lacks the polish that is necessary to match the hardcore controls. All of these things are problems that would absolutely not fly in past Tony Hawk games, and they're more than enough to make any serious gamer walk away.  If you're rich and want to spoil your kids, Tony Hawk: Ride might be worth a look. Though the game plays itself on casual, I could see little kids having a great time hopping around on the board and watching things happen on screen. It may just be random moves and total nonsense, but I've seen far less entertain little kids for hours on end.  However, if you are looking for more, you'll want to start with the campaign. It's the main single-player draw, though it is possible to simply hop into a park you've unlocked for a stress-free exhibition that just allows you to skate around and practice. The campaign pulls every available mode and stage into one package, including a half-dozen or so cities from around the world and several different game types. There's a race where speed and grabbing time bonuses is the objective. Trick sessions are all about scoring points under a time limit. Challenges require you to do specific tricks. Then there's a game like basketball's horse. Do well in these and you'll earn session points which will in turn unlock new areas and challenges to play, as well as new gear and pro skaters.   There isn't much of an actual career progression or any real reward for moving through the game. Screens periodically pop up telling you that you've unlocked new gear, but they won't tell you what gear that is or why you got it. Little videos of pro-skaters either tricking around in real life or telling you how great you're doing are the only real rewards. At the end, Tony Hawk appears and tells you that you've been on some quest. Who knew?  The levels themselves are nothing special, and there aren't many of them. Many look bland and uninspired; others just look and feel dull. The level design and freedom simply can't compete with Tony Hawk games from years ago, let alone the current competition on the market. Just because a new controller is introduced, it doesn't mean level design, visuals, and the total amount of content should suffer.  Before you can even get into the game, Tony Hawk Ride does its best to ruin the fun. The presentation here is about as bad as it possibly can get. For a game that is purportedly casual-friendly, this is a major issue. The load times are absolutely atrocious. Redundant, advertisement laden menus abound. In between every time you skate, Ride requires you to select goofy or regular footing on your board (for some reason you can't just select a preference and keep it, even during the campaign). Play a game of \"eS Ride,\" the Tony Hawk version of horse, and you'll sit through a load screen and then a footing selection screen in between every 10 second trick attempt. Sound like a great party?   I sure hope you like this screen. Tony Hawk: Ride shows it all of the time. On Xbox 360 and PS3, there are D-pad and face buttons on the side of the skateboard controller that do not work in many menus. They simply don't do anything. You can't navigate these menus with the skateboard, either, like you can some other menus. This means you'll have to get off the board and pick up a separate controller every time you get a high score or decide to try a new challenge. On Wii, those buttons do work. However, if your Wii Remote turns off from being idle too long during one of these menus, the game pauses itself and forces you to turn it back on.  Tony Hawk: Ride even fails on the most basic of presentation elements. Upon completing a level in the campaign, session points are awarded based on how well you did. For some reason, the game never tells you how many you won, or even if you did better or worse than your previous attempts. To find out if you got all of the session points, you have to quit out to a different menu and scroll through your campaign progress. At the end of the game, I failed to meet the requirements for one level, yet the game still played the video telling me I had won and that there was one last challenge to complete – a challenge that was still locked. Fail.  About the same amount of care was put into making the multiplayer game fun. There's an eight-player offline Party Play mode. Only one player skates at a time, passing the board off to another hot-potato style in between rounds. Some rounds last several minutes while others just a few seconds depending upon the game type. Remember, load times and unnecessary menus are interjected incessantly here; making the shorter game types a disaster.   This is not a good angle from which to skate. On PS3 and Xbox 360, you can also play online. Barely anybody is playing online and it's easy to see why. There is no interaction between players and no reward for winning. You simply do your race, trick or challenge by yourself, a winner is declared and that's that. Up to four people can participate in this soulless endeavor.  The Wii trades online play for the option of using your Mii in the offline game. This is a cute addition and a goofy good time. For some reason, however, it must be unlocked by playing through the campaign piece-wise. Each level and each difficulty on that level has its own Mii mode unlock. This is a failure to recognize that a casual-friendly feature might be something casual gamers don't want to work for.",

        "Subtitle": "Oh my glob.",
        "Subheader": "By Keza MacDonald Posted: Dec 6, 2013 12:48 pm",
        "Content": "If you’ve ever seen more than five minutes of the Adventure Time cartoon, you will know that it is gloriously silly, inventive, absurd, gleeful and generally rad. Explore the Dungeon Because I DON’T KNOW! is none of these things. It’s a stunning disappointment that a game based on Adventure Time should display this little imagination. Explore the Dungeon doesn’t set its sights too high, which is an encouraging sign for a licensed game that presumably had to be made in a short time with a limited budget. It doesn’t attempt to be anything more than a simple dungeon crawler, sending you down into a 100-level dungeon to smash up skeletons and monsters, collect loot and meet occasional bosses as a group of four (Finn, Jake, Marceline and Cinnamon Bun, initially). Aesthetically, it goes for 16-bit retro, depicting its characters as colourful sprites and opening with a chiptune rendition of the awesome theme tune. But the execution messes up even this simple set of ideas. The most fundamental problem is that there is nothing interesting in the dungeon. Nothing whatsoever. There are no cool enemies, there are no hidden routes or secret passageways, there are no stranded characters or mini-stories or sub-quests to find, and most bafflingly there is no good loot. Basically all you ever find is money. You can pick up new weapons and badges that do things like slightly increase your max health, but there aren’t enough of them, and they don’t appear with nearly enough frequency –15 levels down, my friends and I were finding exactly the same items in chests as we were at the top, and though the selection does expand further down there’s never any mystery, and never any sense of excitement about what you might pick up. It completely fudges the basic Diablo-style compulsion loop that this genre relies upon. The enemies, meanwhile, are stunningly generic. With a cartoon universe as madcap as Adventure Time to draw upon you would hope that you’d encounter more than skeletons, blobs and bats, but most of the time that’s what you’ll be smashing. There’s also almost no skill at all to the simple combat beyond a timed block, which negates damage. That’s it. There are no special skills, and each character has just one special move. There was never much danger of dying – the reason I returned to the surface every five levels was not to regroup, but because I was so bored that I couldn’t stand one more identikit, lifeless floor. The scenery changes now and then as you get further down through the dungeon’s levels, but not significantly enough to maintain interest. At first it looks like it might be randomly generated from a selection of generic walls, pits, enemy spawners and sparse decoration, such is the uninspired arrangement of these levels, but no – they’re the same every time. Every 20 floors there’s a boss, but even these failed to imbue my play sessions with any excitement. “What was the point of that?”, said one of my exasperated play companions after we’d vanquished the second one. It says a lot for Explore the Dungeon that the addition of other people, which can elevate even the most boring games, does nothing for it. It fails to provide the basic elements of co-operation and competition to make it an interesting multiplayer experience. Some characters can float over pits and others can’t, which makes staying together difficult, and results in everyone wandering in disparate directions rather than working together as a team. It doesn’t matter much, as working together is pointless when characters don’t have complementary moves or skills. It’s an exercise in collective tedium – nobody I played this game with wanted to persist after the first ten minutes. As if to hammer this home, when I first started playing on PS3 it froze up after the first ten levels and erased my progress twice – this was fixed by an update, but having to experience those dungeon floors three times gave me ample opportunity to admire how devoid of interest they truly were. Another deep-running problem is that Explore the Dungeon has no tangible sense of progression. Smashing up enemies doesn’t yield XP, so you’re not levelling up. Every time you dive into the dungeon you lose all the loot you gathered before, turning the game into an endurance test – you can’t save up, so the only way to accumulate a decent amount of loot to buy new stuff is to stay down in the dungeon for as long as you can stand it. I have played countless average dungeon crawlers that manage to get that basic fight-loot-improve compulsion loop going, but Explore the Dungeon sadly isn’t even average. The one thing it gets right is cute little 16-bit-style cutscenes , which retain a tiny bit of the Adventure Time spirit. But beyond the inclusion of the appropriate characters, you wouldn’t be able to tell this is an Adventure Time game. Nothing about it really relates to or ties into the show in a meaningful way. Adventure Time is just a skin for an almost impressively boring dungeon crawler. Some of the dialogue even seems to have been ripped directly from old episodes rather than specially recorded.",

        "Content": "Good stealth-assassination games involve cool, calculated setups, tense waiting games, and the eventual thrill of a successful hit. Alekhine’s Gun seems to understand that formula: you’re given a few objectives, dropped into a level full of roaming guards, and forced to make do with a limited selection of tools. But thanks to terrible AI, awkward controls, and loads of performance issues, Alekhine’s Gun fails to execute.  Alekhine’s Gun’s potentially exciting Cold War-era backdrop places you in the role of a KGB operative turned CIA spy, which sounds like an enticing setup for a stealth action game – except poor delivery dampens the appeal right from the start. Characters are bland and performances weak. Static-image cutscenes play between missions, with badly recorded dialogue carrying the story along.   The plot, which jumps around between World War II and the 1960s, has the potential to be interesting, weaving threads of anti-government conspiracies, Nazis, the Mafia, and more into a tale that may have been compelling if delivered right. It isn’t – the flatness of its delivery prevents Alekhine’s Gun from elevating all this political intrigue and historical drama beyond just a backdrop.  NPCs almost immediately forget any wrongdoing once you leave their line of sight. “ Outside the dull cutscenes and walls of text at the start of missions, Alekhine’s Guns levels drop the ball especially hard on the storytelling front, missing out on some great worldbuilding opportunities. Levels are absurdly large, but not in the right ways. The awkward scale is akin to older games, where rooms appear disproportionate to the furnishings and characters occupying them, giving each level in Alekhine’s Gun a distinctly fake feeling. Its spaces may be large, but they are also largely empty. They lack both the density of interactive objects and characters to make them engaging to navigate and the details to ground them in the eras they explore. In the few levels that don’t exude this artificiality, other factors like poor lighting, weak ambience, and awkward NPCs prevent them from feeling like real or interesting spaces to occupy.  Short Term Memory  That makes the exploration that plays a big role here feel weak, too. Whether you’re rescuing journalists in Texas biker bars or assassinating Nazis in World War II flashbacks, most of Alekhine’s Gun’s missions rely on the genre-defining template of sneaking around, memorizing map layouts, learning NPC movement patterns, and setting up ploys to take out enemies. Agent Alekhine sneaking up on an unsuspecting target.  Getting the right disguise is a vital part of this routine, allowing you to access restricted areas without raising the alarm, but the value of the disguise system weakens when you realize how comically inept and forgiving the AI is.  Wonky physics allow you to get away with even more. “ It’s easy to figure out how suspicious other characters are of your behavior by triggering the handy Instinct Mode, which lights up NPCs white if they don’t suspect you of anything, yellow if they’re aware of you, and red if they’re starting to sense something’s not right. Pair this with the alert meter that slowly builds up at the top of the screen if you’re caught in an area you don’t belong, or seen doing something especially suspect, and determining your current status is a quick and convenient process.  Despite this handy system, NPCs almost immediately forget any wrongdoing once you leave their line of sight. Even if they attempt to follow you, closing a door in their face is often enough of a deterrent to throw them off your trail. It isn’t uncommon for AI in stealth games to act like pieces in a puzzle rather than real human beings, with strict patrolling patterns and routines you can easily track and exploit, but Alekhine’s Gun takes this to a whole new and often tragically comic level. Sneaking up on a Nazi scientist.  There were several instances when an enemy attempted to engage me in combat over my suspicious behavior and just as quickly dropped the matter when I ran in a room and closed the door. In one level, I stabbed a Nazi scientist to death in the center of a facility crawling with guards, who somehow took no notice. Only when I started to carry the body away did the alert meter slowly begin to build, as guards began to catch on to what I was doing, but once I dropped the body on the floor, the alert meter disappeared. The guards only cared about the supposedly very important and now definitely very dead scientist when I was actually in the act of dragging him off. And yet, in another level, I accidentally punched at the air while dressed as a hotel waiter, dropping a tray of wine in the process, and a restaurant full of goons in fedoras opened fire on me. Kill a scientist? No problem. Drop the wine? Party foul.  Defying the Laws of Physics  Usually, they’re oblivious. But in the cases where they’re not, wonky physics allow you to get away with even more, including failed assassination attempts going completely unpunished. Circling around a guard with a rag of chloroform doesn’t have to be a stealthy affair when they’ll just as easily rotate in place, gun drawn, trying to get a hit on you as you whip around their peripheral. Weird collision made literally pushing NPCs around as I snuck by them a common strategy, and I was definitely saved on more than one occasion by a door that smoothly clipped through bodies – both alive and dead – as I shut it in another NPC’s face.   It’s not that it’s too easy to exploit Alekhine’s Gun’s AI and physics – it’s that it’s difficult not to. I actually found myself having some mild fun pushing these boundaries to their limits, seeing just how broken this game really is, but these moments weren’t nearly fun or funny enough to make up for the truly frustrating ones that dominated the rest of my experience.  Then there are the bugs. “ Clumsy, unresponsive controls are to blame for a lot of Alekhine’s Gun’s unpleasantness. For example, you can’t scroll through your weapons while moving, turning smooth assassination attempts into ungraceful affairs of jerky, halting movements. Using keyboard shortcuts or just switching out for a gamepad aren’t great options either, because slow response times and stiff animations give everything from movement to combat an uncomfortably heavy quality in either case. Agent Alekhine stuck in the ground.  Then there are the bugs. In my roughly 12 hours with Alekhine’s Gun, I encountered glitchy shadows, got stuck behind a bookshelf, boarded a magical elevator with disappearing doors, fell halfway into the ground, fell completely out of the map, and had to restart because of constant crashes. That includes one that occurred every time I quit out, which would also freeze my PC in the process.",

        "Content": "Several generations of gamers most intimately associate platforming with Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. Side-scrolling platformer The Other Brothers was smart to try to tap into that nostalgia by molding its star characters after the red and green duo, down to mustache and suspenders. But the comparison unfortunately falls flat. The lack of content and mechanical polish render these ruggedly charming pixelated heroes and large levels unenjoyable.   Thanks to a post-release patch, The Other Brothers' stiff controls have been improved via mostly responsive virtual analogue or digital controls, which can be resized and repositioned. But the patch feels more like a hasty stop-gap instead of a true solution to stiff virtual buttons.  Brothers Joe and Jim play identically. Along with a double jump to stomp enemies, they have two power-ups: a temporary \"flower-power\" that allows them to throw wrenches and a bullet-time power-up that slows everything down. However, the latter only appeared once in my playthrough and felt underused.  The most invigorating mechanic for me involved stealth-like avian abduction. Collected white pigeons become a stand-in for a health meter. The birds scatter when a brother takes damage, similar to how the rings function in Sonic the Hedgehog. Cue a frantic scramble to recover as many birds as possible any time you get hit. Each stage also contains three well-hidden gold pigeons that encourage thorough exploration and offer big points to complete high score challenges.  The stages themselves feel rather large for an iOS platformer, offering numerous paths to explore. Collecting oil cans off-the-beaten-path provides for even more points. Checkpoints are few but fair. With a handful of lives and diverse, hard enemies, perfecting each stage requires practice. Unfortunately, The Other Brothers has only six levels to master. Even with its large environments, this is a short campaign.  The Other Brothers also offers only two bosses, barely meeting their advertised “action-packed, zany boss fights.” Both were challenging and visually striking at least, including a climactic battle atop a train with the sai-wielding Fat Ninja and an army of minions.   While the stages have high score and hidden object goals for replayability, camera and enemy issues outweighed my desire to return. The camera sometimes fails to center around the action, obscuring jump paths and allowing off-screen enemies to fire first. Overly accurate, upper-cutting bad guys hit me without time to respond when I descended, too. Finally, some enemies seemed to fall from the sky to hunt me down, furthering the needless frustration. The Game Center leaderboards suggest how frustrated others feel, too: 20,600 players ranked in stage 1, but only 3,800 bothered to rank in stage 2. If I didn’t commit to beating the campaign for review, I think I would have joined the 80% who went missing.",

        "Content": "There's no sense beating around the bush: Afrika is probably the most boring game I've ever played.  Here, you're a freelance photographer living out in the wilds of Africa. You have a do-nothing partner who chills in your tent reading all the time and you accept jobs through the laptop in said tent. You'll choose the job to take, set off into the great outdoors, and photograph the cheetahs, birds, and gazelles living on the continent. When you return with your images, you'll upload them to the computer and send them off to your clients, who will reply with a grade of your overall work as well as your technique and such. They'll also throw some money in so that you can purchase new equipment and the like.  It sounds interesting, but I can assure you, it isn't.  Momma said knock you out. This water buffalo's going to knock you out.  It's not that the photography concept is boring. I was actually looking forward to being out in the bush and carefully framing my shots. What's boring here is how everything is presented and executed. You'll wake up in the tent, choose a job, and then exit. The game loads, and then you're outside talking to your guide or climbing in your Jeep-like ride. There's no voice work in Afrika, so everything pops up as text below the onscreen characters. When you're getting your feet wet, the guide will take you straight to the thing you need to shoot -- need a gazelle? Hop in the back of the car and he'll drive you straight to a gazelle.  I found this guided tour incredibly boring because it was removing the adventure of exploring, but it turns out things only get worse when the guide leaves -- vanishes, even -- and you get to drive the car yourself. The car's just a box on wheels that clips through the ground, and it's sluggish as all hell. Tapping the gas or brake takes a couple of beats to register, small bushes will stop the car in its tracks, and even though this thing's a four-wheel drive vehicle, it can't take on medium-sized hills. When you manage to get the thing stuck, the game fades to black and resets the car.  Still, I'm getting away from the heart of the matter, right? Afrika's all about shooting photos and not driving. Trouble is, even the photos aren't handled that well. When you see something you want to shoot, you bring up the camera with Square, work your orientation and zoom with the stick, and then snap with R1. The whole process is tedious, and -- like the car's controls -- the shutter button is actually pretty sluggish, but it won't matter because the animals will do whatever you need them to do (eating out of trees, looking at you head on, etc.) for quite awhile, because they're pretty stiff and lifeless.  In fact, all of Africa is pretty lifeless in this game. The world is barren -- just a flat grass texture spread out over the world for you to drive across -- and the animals are in very specific places. Having a hippo pool kind of takes away the excitement of going out and looking for hippos. Having just one climbable tree in the first section of the game makes it pretty self-explanatory as to which tree you need to go to in order to take a photo of a giraffe. I expected to be roaming the countryside with a notebook full of things I'd need to shoot and having to carefully pick my shots. In Afrika, you just get one specific quest and drive out to one specific place and shoot the one specific animal.  What's cool is the SixAxis portion of the game. By default, you'll pull out your camera in landscape mode, but rotating the controller as if you're holding a camera will make you shoot vertically.   There's so much going on! There are also \"Big Game\" moments in Afrika. Here, something exciting is going down and you need to capture it -- the first one being a cheetah hunting a gazelle. You ride in the car next to the cheetah while it chases its prey and snap photos of it closing in and finally leaping on the animal. When you're done, the game tells you which of your pictures is the best shot. This provides a welcome break from squatting in a bush and waiting for something mundane to happen (Wait for a hippo to yawn!), but it still calls out a number of the game's hitches -- the animals move like robots, the shoddy ground textures, etc.  In that vein, you're going to run into a number of technical mishaps. For starters, there's a seven-minute install at the beginning of the game, but it appears to do nothing to make the title run any better. In fact, Afrika is littered with framerate dips. When you're awkwardly running across a field, you'll see what I'm talking about. When you click on the disc from the XMB, you're looking at more than two minutes of waiting before the game loads and gets you to the actual gameplay. If you choose to save -- and this is every time you save -- expect the process to take one minute and 12 seconds. That's right -- more than a minute of staring at that little progress bar fill before you can do anything.  If you're wondering -- and just about everyone who has stopped by my desk has been -- you can't die in Afrika. If you get too close to the animal, you'll see them starting to get all riled up and you have a few movements to get the hell out of there. If you don't move, the beast will charge at you and you'll wake up at base camp. Similarly, you can't run down animals in your car. If you hit them, the car stops and your lazy partner reprimands you.",

        "Subheader": "By Martin Robinson Updated: Nov 6, 2020 7:04 am Posted: Apr 25, 2008 11:01 pm",
        "Content": "How can Grand Theft Auto IV ever live up to the expectations bestowed upon it? From its first unveiling over a year ago, hype levels have been steadily escalating towards the stratosphere, and surely it would be impossible for Rockstar to satiate the lust of those deprived of a fresh Grand Theft Auto experience for nearly four years?  It's clear that this iteration of Grand Theft Auto is a markedly different beast to its predecessor San Andreas, and whatever your feelings about the last outing there's no doubting the series' new direction works towards creating a more immersive experience. Nearly all vestiges of videogame signifiers have been shorn away and for once it's perfectly valid to state that playing the game is akin to watching a cinema blockbuster. The HUD has been refined, appearing only when Niko is engaged in action, and the omnipresent map at the bottom left of the screen is often all that remains to remind onlookers that this is an interactive entertainment.  Videogame artefacts such as hidden packages have been omitted – though those who have a fetish for collecting need not worry, as in their place is a series of collectables of a more naturalised manner - and the jumps that have long marked out the Grand Theft Auto games are more subtly implemented. Indeed, it was only after a few hours play that we realised they were still there, so well camouflaged they were amidst the architecture of Liberty City.   The explosions are truly breathtaking, leaving impressive smoke trails in their wake. And what a creation the city is. Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City is one of the finest worlds we've seen in gaming since we gallivanted around the Hyrule of Ocarina of Time. It's a world that lives and breathes with its own authenticity, and with an effortlessness that has rarely been glimpsed in gaming to date. A storm comes in and the lighting engine paints the streets of Broker with a melancholic taint, with passers-by erecting their umbrellas in the downpour and those more ill prepared raise their suitcases above their heads and run for cover, while in the background a lone saxophonist plays under the shelter of a band stand. The sun shines and the streets burst into life, light rays bouncing off the pavement and glistening over the bonnets of traffic. The level of detail informs every aspect of Liberty City, with even the most secluded alleyway exuding its own atmosphere and conspiring to make Grand Theft Auto IV's world one of the most complete witnessed to date.  This whole world is painted with its own distinct perspective - yes, this is a more realistic Grand Theft Auto than ever before, but it's also one of the most stylised entries, with a filter applied to the graphics attaining an effect that's akin to pointillism and at times can seem almost impressionistic. That's not to say there aren't occasional dips in framerate or texture creep, but none of this ever impinges on what is undoubtedly one of the most achingly beautiful videogame creations to date.   The HUD never proves intrusive to the action. Above all it's a gritty creation, with the more down to earth and grimy nature of Niko's story reflected in each brick that builds Liberty City. At the beginning of the game, when confined to the Broker District by a terrorist threat, Niko can take a peek at what lies ahead of him in his quest, his view of the peaks of the skyscrapers of Algonquin filtered through the dirt of Liberty City that blights the lens. These details stretch to the interiors as well – this is a world of squalor, and no more is that evident than when climbing a flight of stairs to Niko's first abode in the slums of Broker, the strip lights humming and a muffled television audible through the door of a neighbouring flat.  This Liberty City is unmistakably a mirror image of contemporary New York, and with this fresh focus Rockstar has delivered one of its most potent satires yet. From the terrorist alert that initially locks down the city to the feeds from Weasel News that beautifully ape a certain real-life feral news service reporting on Niko's more outlandish escapades, to the mayoral election that is so brutally fought out over the airwaves between the fictional Michael Graves and John Hunter, it's never too difficult to ascertain the real-life sources for Grand Theft Auto IV's swipes. It's evident too in the bastardised internet that is accessible to Niko, which proves a deepening rabbit hole of increasingly hilarious skits on the online generation as you click through the countless sites on offer. The cultural references come from far and wide, one radio advert beckoning down the citizens of Liberty City to a show from the artists Simon & Miguel who uncannily resemble our own Gilbert & George in their pursuit of the eccentric. These satires stretch beyond the radio waves, with Niko able to unwind after a hard day's killing by settling down in front of the goggle box, and amidst the spoof history channels and histrionic chat shows we're sure we saw a none too subtle swipe at the Master Chief.    Of course no matter with what splendor the world has been created it's nothing without the means with which to explore it, and here Rockstar have supplied the most exquisite toolbox seen in an open world game. The euphoria physics engine takes centre stage, granting the world a physicality that connects players with the world to an unprecedented level. Niko feels more a part of his world than any other protagonist in a Grand Theft Auto title, be he brushing pedestrians aside or vaulting fences in an attempt to flee the police.  Combat proves a triumph as well, the new cover system flourishing gun fights with a level of sophistication that matches any other current generation shooter. The lock-on works reliably to snatch onto the nearest threat, and for those that prefer their shooting a little more freeform a light press of the trigger will enable free aim. Likewise, the cover system works as well as any of its peers, hugging Niko to any in game object and gifting fire fights with a much appreciated new depth.   Liberty City's friendly doctor at hand. With its extended subtleties, the new wanted system also substantially alters the way the game is played when Niko is under heat. As the stars escalate, so too does the circle on the map, accentuating the thrill of a chase as Niko desperately races to escape the area and seek respite. Find yourself submitting to the chasing police and Niko is granted one final get-out clause, with a swift button tap elevating him from his knees to maintain the pursuit.  Behind the wheel, the vehicles handling lends itself to more cinematic driving, the rear end of the majority of vehicles having a propensity to hang out to a degree which can be initially galling. It soon emerges that a more subtle approach is required to negotiating the right angles of Algonquin or the swerves and inclines of the later Aldernay isle, and it's no longer possible to fling a car around with blithe abandon. The extended detail of Liberty City also affects the way cars are used, with each road now adorned with its own texture which the car's springs respond to, be it a cobbled street in a suburban back alley or the pot holes than pockmark the streets of Broker.   Finding cover is imperative, and adds a welcome depth to gunplay. With these extended mechanics there's a variety to the vehicles that is now more pronounced. Front-wheel-drive cars will lurch towards understeer, their rear-wheel-drive counterparts allowing for some breathtaking slides. This variety extends not only to the models of vehicles available, but to the state in which you find them. Jack the wrong car in the excitement of a three-star chase and you could find yourself at the wheel of a misfiring beast, clumsily working its way through the gears and spitting out plumes of burnt oil.  In-car combat is another area that's been furnished with a suite of new features, not least of which is the ability to lock on to a pursued car, thankfully bidding farewell to the sometimes chaotic chases that blighted previous Grand Theft Autos, and with the added capacity to free aim from the drivers seats vehicular combat is no longer the headache it used to be.  That's not to mention the myriad other ways to traverse the breadth of the city – and despite any initial fears of Liberty City's size in light of the offerings of San Andreas, we can assure you it is vast – such as taxis or helicopters. Hail a taxi and you'll get the option to either skip straight to your desired location, or sit back and enjoy a spectator's view of the city, complete with typically irreverent commentary from your driver. Get yourself behind the controls of a helicopter and prepare for a vast intake of air as the full splendour and scale of Liberty City is offered up in widescreen majesty.    And the story itself? We'll leave the details for you to discover at your pleasure, but needless to say this is a tale more melancholic and mature than some of the hyperactive extremities of the series' past. Niko himself is sure to become a videogaming icon of our generation, an embittered ex-soldier with a murky past that marks itself in his weariness, yet also informs his hard-edged yet ultimately humanist perspective on the brave new world of Liberty City. It's no longer a rags-to-riches story, with the narrative more nuanced and all the more affecting for it. Indeed, so pervasive is Niko's story we found it informing the way we approached the game, finding ourselves less inclined to indulge in mindless rampages we deemed out of character for our Eastern European protagonist.   WIth it's ability to transform the city, the lighting engine is one of the stars. This is all aided by a wealth of characters, all painted with a remarkable clarity and all serving to bolster the strengths of the main story. Naturally their stories are predominantly told through some sterling cutscenes which benefit from the enhanced engine that mercifully never outstay their welcome, and like everything else in Grand Theft Auto IV the scriptwriting has been ratcheted up to a degree previously unprecedented in the medium.  But the most rewarding way with which to interact with the cast is through Niko's phone, an item that soon emerges as a core tool in the interaction with the game's characters. As friends are picked up over the course of Niko's travels, they begin to offer social invitations – and in one of the game's many superb touches an incoming call will disturb the radio of any car he is traveling in – and it's easy to get drawn in to each of their narrative arcs. The activities that are open are widespread and well implemented, be it the bowling game that offers surprising depth or less interactive pursuits such as cabaret or the comedy club - which contains a number of surprises it's again best left to discover for yourself. Perhaps most notoriously there is also the option of visiting a bar, the results of which never fail to entertain as Niko spills erratically on the street before stumbling his way home.   What GTA's really about - a five star melee. Whilst these prove entertaining diversions, they also provide a framework for the burgeoning relationships in the game which very quickly begin to matter for the player. It's genuinely heart-breaking to turn down a friend requesting a drink, as it too is genuinely surprising when on our second date with one of Grand Theft Auto IV's many love interests our beau noted how we had changed our attire since we last met.  Which means when the element of choosing who to favour in the game world Niko can be faced with some truly agonizing decision. At certain branches in the storyline he is faced with the option of pledging allegiance to certain characters – often to the fatal detriment of others. Though we're loathed to spill details, at one point Niko is presented with siding with a young upstart with somewhat dubious morals or his suicidal and life-weary nemesis who is fresh out of jail. Do you punish the fresh-faced gangster for his loose morality or put the melancholic ex-convict out of his misery? It's a choice that had us holding the gun to the head of our chosen victim for minutes of extended deliberation, and when the final bullet rang out it left a sick feeling in the pit of our stomachs as we were left unsure of our actions. The choices are never clear cut, and it reflects the murky morality of this Liberty City.    Again, the missions contain joys we'd rather not disclose for fear of ruining the experience, but rest assured they offer a variety previously unseen in Grand Theft Auto. From suiting yourself up for a funeral to scouring the internet for a potential date, they're essentially grounded in the reality of Liberty City and never work against the hard work of the narrative to create an immersive atmosphere. One mission in particular that occurs midway through the plot is sure to gain notoriety for the challenge it presents, an extended bank heist that for all its pains manages to provide one of the punchiest set pieces of the game that easily rivals the best Hollywood has to offer.   The sun sets on another day in Liberty CIty. But like previous Grand Theft Autos, some of the best moments occur when you step outside of the script – be it painting your own name on a car with bullet holes and riding into battle, or stealing your first helicopter and taking a night time flight to the strains of Queen's One Vision before stepping out into a deserted Algonquin and embarking on a 15-minute six-star chase. With the toolset provided, and with the game world so rich with opportunity, we're sure to be swapping tales of our antics in Liberty City for years to come.  Seeing Niko's story out at the leisurely pace it deserves will consume some 40 hours of play, all of which is supplemented by the dizzying amount of multiplayer options. It will be interesting to see where the hordes migrate to on online play, be it the thrill of vanilla deathmatch, the bedlam of team mafia or the serenity of freely adventuring the city with friends. Regardless, this is a package that will truly keep players enthralled well beyond the lifetime of its native hardware. ",

        "Subtitle": "The legacy of Double Dribble continues to dwindle.",
        "Subheader": "By Jeremy Dunham Updated: Dec 13, 2018 4:47 am Posted: Oct 10, 2002 7:00 am",
        "Content": "It's been a renaissance year for basketball games in 2002. Whether you're discussing NBA 2K3's god-like approach to realism, NBA Live's intuitive right stick control feature, or NBA ShootOut's immersive career mode, the bar has been raised for any title that follows them. So elite is the choice that gamers need make in todays already packed market, picking the one edition that deserves your fifty bucks is as difficult a task as choosing a new car (albeit on a somewhat smaller scale). \"Which title gives me the most for my money?\" is a question that we've seen in excess over the last few weeks, and one that several editors have been toiling over here at the office as well. As difficult a decision that it may be, one thing we can guarantee you is that NBA Starting Five is not among them.  Show-Off The feature set is acceptable enough with all the options and extras that the casual gamer could hope for. Exhibition and Quick Start are self-explanatory methods to play against the computer or a friend in a game of one-on-one, while the Season and Playoff modes allow you take your favorite team to the championship through 82 hard-fought games. Trades and Free Agents are in there too, and there are plenty of post-season awards that can be earned for prosperity (including MVP, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player, Sixth Man, and more). And just for good measure, Konami Osaka has even seen fit to throw in a Franchise feature and the standardized Create-A-Player editor we've come to know and love over the years. As you can see, the meat of the options are actually quite hearty and match up well with any other basketball title on the market. Where the problem lies however, is in the actual execution of those features. It's almost as though the development team stopped optimizing its code at some point, and then slipped it by the quality assurance guys before they could notice.   Specifically, Starting Five is just plain full of bugs, anomalies, and other issues that seriously take away from the extras. You can for instance, create your very own persona and draft him onto the team of your choice but that process will most likely take you in upwards of 30-40 minutes. Not because of how many alterable attributes there are per character mind you, but because of the horrendous load times. Apparently giving priority to the music over the textures for new faces and heads, there are times when you will find yourself waiting for at least a minute when trying to find a look-alike for yourself --Seriously. When you take into account that there's almost 20 combinations of head and face selections, that's a serious wait to do nothing more than create a make believe player. Additionally, the A.I. used for simulations is way off. When simulating a few seasons with the Lakers, I was surprised to find my NBA Finals opponents to be the Toronto Raptors. Naturally, I swept the first three games and when I played them in the final game the result was a complete and utter joke. How did that team make it to the Finals to begin with? Resetting and trying again was just as ridiculous, Nets vs. Grizzlies? Are you kidding me? Player trades were pretty bad too, as I was getting mismatched offers that just shouldn't happen. It doesn't matter what universe you live in, Jason Kidd for Dalibor Bagaric is a bad deal, and giving up Shaq for DeSagana Diop doesn't make much sense either. On the whole, the A.I. in both franchise and season mode, was seriously lacking.  Gameplay  Starting Five manages to get one aspect of the game completely right: the shooting percentage. Consistently in the low 50% scoring range, your players toss the ball like the real thing. Of course, there's a difference between simulating realism and actually experiencing it. So while it may be all fine and good that your baskets brick half the time you attempt them for sake of realism, it's not all that fun to play. After a bit of practice, you can get those scores up to 70% maximum which is a lot more enjoyable, but it takes quite awhile before you can accomplish that. Part of the problem is that the game is far too heavy on defense. I've played numerous exhibitions (six-minute quarters) where there's a combined 30-40 blocks per game, and damn near 60-70 rebounds per side. What that translates into is a whole lot of moments where it's flat out terrifying to make a basket -- And these aren't just the good teams I'm talking about, this is for all teams. From Cleveland all the way up to Los Angeles, your 6'3\" guys will dominate the outside shot like they're nine feet tall (with play in the paint almost as gnarly). Similarly, three-point attempts rarely find their mark, and with two humans playing don't be surprised if you find it an accomplishment if you sink 3 the entire game between you. Because of these mechanics, the best (only?) way to score is to drive up on the inside and become the lay-up and jam master. That too is difficult however, as the players all apparently move at the same speed when not using turbo and when it is used, it last for only a few seconds before becoming entirely depleted. What you're left with is a basketball game that forces you to the inside drive but penalizes you for attempting it. It's a frustrating experience to be sure. Unfortunately, that doesn't end the caveat list in the least. When faced with other players in one-on-one match-ups, touching them is the same as running into a brick wall. You will literally stop in your tracks the second you hit another player before the game kicks in and realizes that you're no longer trying to rush the basket. At that point it switches to box up mode, and both the guy on defense and the man with the rock slow down and stare at each other for multiple seconds for no reason whatsoever.   Put in simpler terms, the gameplay is outdated. Stuck somewhere between Electronic Arts' Bulls vs. Lakers and Sony's original ShootOut , the simplicity of the mechanics and baffling defensive choices feel as though you're playing a game on your Sega Genesis and not a modern day console. In conjunction with load times that last between 70-90 seconds per game (not kidding, we timed it), NBA Starting Five wears out its welcome rather quickly. One aspect of the game I did enjoy however, was its approach to free throws. Not overly elaborate like Sega's game or as simple as EA's, the trigger-based system works pretty well and is as complicated as this type of thing should get. A take of the Live version of the free throw method, the left and right triggers represent the left and right arms of the player. Tap each trigger a second time when they're in the appropriate spot and the toss is in. Simple, but not too simple, I liked this alternative style most thoroughly.  Graphics Though NBA 2K3 can still claim the title for the most dominant visual performer on the court, Starting Five weighs in near the bottom of the pile. To its credit, the character models are good and sport a nice variety in details, but the animations that move them are way behind the times. Lumbering, almost lazy-looking motions dictate their every action and the one-frame movements of their faces are laughably bad. At least the details are acceptable with a polygonal bench and moderately put-together crowd. Stadiums too are nicely rendered, and the occasional taunts between possessions are entertaining. It's not really a bad presentation (there's specialized intros and light shows to accompany each team), and at the very least it doesn't make you want to vommit.  Sound Another area where the bug monster apparently shows its ugly face, the audio is a mixed bag. The crowds sound great and react like a real audience should, with the bouncing basketball taking its subtle supporting role very well. The beef however, is that of the announcers. Sometimes on, sometimes off, there are instances where there's absolutely no commentary at all for several minutes. Then out of nowhere, Al Albert pops in with a quick snippet of info before slinking off into the distance. --very strange, and not very impressive.",

        "Title": "AFL Live Review",
        "Subtitle": "After four years of waiting, Aussie Rules Football fans finally have a new game to call their own. Does it deliver?",
        "Subheader": "By Daniel Golding Updated: May 8, 2012 5:36 am Posted: Apr 27, 2011 1:15 am",
        "Content": "Fans of AFL have had a pretty good few years. Attendance and participation have swelled, and some of the best teams to have ever played the game have emerged. Yet fans of Aussie Rules Football video games have had it tough. In fact, they've always had it tough. Previous AFL games ranged in quality from mediocre to near-unplayable, and the multi-platform franchise was discontinued after 2007. While it was probably a good idea to give the AFL series a rest, it also meant nearly four years without a multi-platform AFL video game. Until now.   AFL Live , the first AFL game developed by Melbourne's Big Ant Studios , is an attempt to breathe some life into the video game form of Australia's most popular football code, and much of the buzz leading up to release suggested that Big Ant might be on to a winner. So does AFL Live deliver, or is it just another disappointment?  Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding AFL Live is one of gameplay: does AFL Live actually play like a game of football? Well, yes. Sometimes. Matches proceed at a much faster pace than in previous AFL video games, effectively capturing the shift to quicker, handball-based play that has dominated recently. Yet certain quirks of the game, as translated to video game form, mean that AFL Live never quite encapsulates the feeling of a real match, and can sometimes even jolt the player out of the experience.  AFL Live has a very prominent learning curve, and it will be at least a dozen matches before players will begin to fully grasp the game. My first match saw reigning premiers Collingwood smashed by the very average Port Power, and things didn't improve for several matches until I truly understood what was required for victory, even on the easiest difficulty settings.   Dave's basketball-style shooting method wasn't embraced by the rest of his team. In fact, he was beaten to a bloody pulp after the game.  AFL Live pushes a stoppage-dominated version of football, built upon ultra-fast tackling. Breaking free of a pack is difficult, and creating space even more so. Tackles come quickly and numerously, often locking down play for several ball-ups or throw-ins at a time.  Unfortunately, some actions are simply unrealistically hard in AFL Live. Big Ant have imagined a world where players routinely miss running shots at an open goal, and where players can barely sprint without being penalised by umpires for not bouncing. Booting it out of a pack is also near impossible, given the charge time required for any moderately powerful kick.  Therefore, at its worst, AFL Live can feel more like the stop-start flow of Rugby than Aussie Rules. Yet at its best, with good players opening up contested possession with a series of quick handballs, it comes close to the real thing. Players move realistically through packs in order to draw a pass, forwards press for the running lead, and defensive players launch satisfying punches to spoil the mark. There is a solid foundation of gameplay here, and it's almost certainly the best AFL experience we've had in a video game so far. However, AFL Live is still too hit-and-miss to be recommended on gameplay alone.  AFL Live includes a number of nice touches, like umpires tending to throw the ball up rather than bouncing in the wet, and Collingwood and Essendon standing for the anthem on ANZAC Day (although in reality it's the last post that's played, not the national anthem, but hey, you can't have everything). Yet there are also small touches that could have easily been included but are notably absent, like pre-match banners, or the ability to view a replay at any time from the in-game menu. Even the state leagues, like the VFL or WAFL, or a team of all-time greats would have been nice additions, but remain absent.  There are larger omissions as well - a career mode, or a manager mode, or even back-to-back seasons all could have been included, but for a game built from the ground up, it isn't surprising that other aspects were focussed on.  Unfortunately, bigger problems exist with AFL Live than simple omissions. The sound design is unimaginative and insubstantial. Players will have heard virtually all that the commentary from Dennis Cometti and Brian Taylor has to offer within twenty minutes of booting up AFL Live, and what is there fails to impress with an unnatural flow and a frankly amateurish implementation. Matches sound lifeless and without atmosphere: while there are cheers and boos, any form of chanting is completely absent. That means no intimidating slow-and-long Collingwood chant that was so deafening at last year's Grand Finals. No screaming of 'yellow and black' at Richmond matches. An AFL game should be a sound designer's paradise, but you wouldn't know it by playing AFL Live.  On top of this, only two pieces of music ('Holy Grail' by Hunters and Collectors, and 'Last Ones Standing', the Denis Cometti-penned McKenna song) are included in the game - eight minutes of music for every menu, every half-time scoreboard, every replay. Sports games have a high bar for music, and AFL Live pales to absurdity in comparison.   Don't fly too close to the lights little swan.  AFL Live is also a mixed bag in visual terms. The game is presented well, with slick menus and reasonable half and full-time displays. Animations are generally good, with most players moving naturally and convincingly, while likenesses are passable from a distance. Camera angles will always be a problem for any AFL game, and they are particularly sticky for AFL Live. Only a close-up, for example will allow easy manoeuvring through packs, but only a wide-shot will give enough vision for the long pass. Despite offering many different settings to choose from (all variants of close, broadcast and end-to-end), all have their issues and none are particularly satisfying.  Multiplayer is an expected feature of any sports game, and it is an enjoyable facet of AFL Live. Local games can include between two and seven players, and it works about as well as the single-player experience. Online multiplayer is also present, but due to PSN outages we were unable to test it. Team editing and create-a-player modes are reasonable, though they do reveal some strange design choices (Nathan Ablett, a player who has yet to play a game for the league's worst team this year, is ranked a mere six points worse than Scott Pendlebury, a favourite for this year's Brownlow, for example).

        "Title": "Rainbow Six",
        "Subtitle": "The popular Tom Clancy-inspired FPS makes its way to the PS. Sadly, it's too little too late.",
        "Subheader": "By Matt White Updated: Dec 13, 2018 2:50 am Posted: Jan 4, 2000 1:00 am",
        "Content": "It's really quite intriguing that it's taken Red Storm so long to finally make some console ports of their highly successful PC smash hit, Rainbow Six . We're not sure what brought on this brilliant revelation so late in the ball game, although we know that Sony held the game held up for some time. Also, considering that the PC game's sequel, Rogue Spear is already out, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In any case, we sort of wish that they hadn't even bothered making the PlayStation port, as it has nothing on the original. Not only did they cut up the gameplay elements, but the graphics and basic controls are so mind numbingly bad that I feel somewhat less intelligent after having played it. Gameplay The game starts off with a standard fare PlayStation FMV detailing the storyline -- The sequence, in its entirety, isn't particularly engrossing. It takes its merry ol' time telling the story, but to put it simply, there's a lot of terrorists out there up to no good, and, as the crack team of anti-terrorist dudes calling themselves Rainbow, it's your job to kick some bad guy @ss. Your travels will find you vying for victory over foes in locales all across the globe, but, strangely enough, most of the play areas look the same. The mission outlines vary quite a lot, but the meat of the gameplay always comes down to two basic themes: Hostage rescue and search & destroy. Hostage rescue is what you'll be doing most of the time, and, to put it in twentieth century terms that ya'll understand, it can be quite a bitch. In the PC version, the hostage situations became quite tedious, particularly later on in the game -- The split second precision and ruthless marksmanship required to pull off rescue operations really pushed the limits (as well as the patience) of many a gamer. Unfortunately for PlayStation-philes, this dilemma is worsened with the coming of the PlayStation port, as the shoddy controls make fine-aiming very difficult, especially when in a hurry. Heck, one time I had a terrorist right in front of me, in practically point blank range, and it still took me several shots to hit him. That's definitely problematic. For most people, especially those who play first person shooters on their computers, a mouse/keyboard combination is the only way to fly. Obviously, all console FPS have this working against them from the get-go, but some handle it better than others. Unfortunately, Rainbow Six, no matter how you configure the controller settings, just isn't easy to play on the PlayStation. Even if it's just a matter of personal adjustment, by the time you've adjusted, you won't want to play the game anymore. The default setting with the Dual Shock controller employs both analog sticks, with the left moving and strafing, and the right moving your view. This setup seems nice on paper, but with all things considered, it doesn't work very well during gameplay. The Dual Shock analog sticks aren't extremely well suited for precise aiming in the first place, but what makes it even more difficult are the inconsistent framerates. There are a number of other annoyances and problems present in the PlayStation version. First of all, when you play, the character just doesn't seem to \"fit\" in the environments too well. You get stuck in door frames, you must sometimes crawl to get through large openings, and doors don't want to open toward you unless you walk several steps away from them. What is up with that? We're chalking that up to bad programming. Pretty sad. Furthermore, two of the most entertaining game aspects present in the PC version aren't included in the PSX port. First, you can no longer plan out your missions manually. This loss is felt more deeply by some than others, as some people found it as merely tedious and troublesome. But to many, it greatly enhanced the gameplay by adding a huge strategy element and making the accomplishment of your goals much more rewarding. Another one of the finer aspects of the PC original was the Internet multiplayer mode. Obviously, this isn't possible on the PlayStation -- But they could have at least thrown us in some split screen action. I truly don't think that's too much to ask. Graphics Visually, Rainbow Six is an absolute joke. We're not sure what went wrong, or just who was smoking the funny pipes during the development process, but the visual quality is laughably bad. We're talking worse than many first generation PlayStation efforts. Not only are the graphics pixelated and soupy looking, but the framerate is down the tubes. There ain't no call for that where I come from. Aside from the visual mess that makes up your surroundings, all of the humans in the game are atrociously modeled. We're talking super deformity. Perhaps the people handling the port were so high on the funky crack rocks that their perception of \"normal looking human\" was drastically changed. In any case, Rainbow Six for PlayStation seems to link \"nicely\" with \"pixelated mess,\" \"pea soup,\" and \"freaks in pixelated pea soup land.\" Sound There's not a whole lot to be said for the sound scheme of Rainbow Six. The music is quaintly understated, if quite sparse, and the sound effects are your basic military fare. The guns sound like they should, as do the various other pieces of weaponry. There's also the occasional mid-mission speech, with verbal flourishes ranging from \"Got him!\" to the now-famous \"Tango Down!\"",

It's a plodding pace of play that must have been made as a concession to the limited power of the Game Boy in its first year of release, as the first version of the portable was plagued with underpowered screen technology that would blur any element moving too quickly across it (like a flying baseball or a running player).

        "Content": "Mass Effect Galaxy is a high profile iPhone game for 2009. This is a major console property coming to the iPhone and it's no small deal that Electronic Arts chose the iPhone to tell a side narrative that introduces gamers to characters from the upcoming Mass Effect 2. However, the kind of attention Mass Effect Galaxy draws is a double-edged space sword. Hardcore gamers will tune into the iPhone game because of the Mass Effect name. However, they will come with expectations. Those expectations will not serve them well because Mass Effect Galaxy is not an RPG, but a small shooter. Worse, it's not even a very good shooter at that. And this is when the trap is sprung. A hardcore gamer that plays Mass Effect Galaxy might assume this is all the iPhone can do and not come back.  What makes Mass Effect Galaxy such a tragedy is that it did not have to be a bad game. The iPhone is more than capable of hosting a Mass Effect experience that fans would appreciate. Look at Terminator: Salvation, Assassin's Creed, or Prey Invasion. Would Mass Effect on iPhone be a huge epic like the Xbox 360 game? No, but it could get a hell of a lot closer to it than this tepid shooter. This isn't even a compromise; it's a cop-out. At some point, somebody should have looked at Mass Effect Galaxy and thought, this is a mistake. No fan, and that's who would buy it, will like this.   But I'm not here to entirely judge Mass Effect Galaxy on what it isn't. The game is a pointless tilt-and-touch shooter where you just clear out room after room of space thugs, from pirates to batarian terrorists, pretty much like the classic arcade game Smash TV. You simply tap an enemy to target it and then Jacob does the rest of the work, auto-firing regular bullets until you either select another enemy or the current target is dead. You deploy special moves like biotic attacks (temporarily freeze the enemy) or shield removal by touching icons along the side of the screen. The most effective secondary attack is the heavy shell, which does splash damage -- but watch out, because it will injure you, too, if you are too close. Each special move has a refill timer, so you cannot simply hammer on the heavy shells. Once you kill every enemy, the exit opens and you move into the next room only to repeat the same procedure.   Kill everything, move to the next room. Rinse. Repeat.  These repetitive shooting scenes are simply not much fun. For one thing, they are slow. And that's not slow as in \"tactical,\" but slow as in something was not optimized before the game was thrown on to the App Store. Often, the game drops to an unacceptable frame rate -- it becomes a slide show. I tried restarting my iPhone and launching Mass Effect Galaxy before any other app or game and it didn't help. But even if it was smooth, it would not matter much. Tilting the phone to guide Jacob is clumsy. Supposedly, you can calibrate the accelerometer by pausing the game so you can play the game at any angle, such as sitting or in bed. This never quite worked right for me. The only time I could get Jacob to move with any degree of precision was when I held the iPhone parallel to the floor and hovered over it.  The dialog scenes between combat missions are also slimmed down from the console game. Since the narrative was such a critical part of the Mass Effect experience, it was important for BioWare to include them here. You do not have branching conversations, per se, but you can select responses from multiple options and sort of guide a conversation along. You can immediately challenge a foe and jump into combat, or talk it out a little and get more pieces of the story. How much consequence dialog scenes have is questionable. Your responses do not shape Jacob's character like they did Shepherd's in Mass Effect. That's terribly disappointing since personal evolution is so critical to the Mass Effect experience.  At least the story itself is interesting (the outcast batarian race wants to join the civilized alien races on the galactic space station Citadel, but not everybody is onboard with the idea) and you get to tackle it from different angles. You do get to choose your missions from a galaxy map from time to time and customize the order in which you do things. I liked this. Mass Effect is about choice and I was ready to grab on to any choices the game offered. It just needs to offer more. More chances to shape Jacob's character. More RPG stuff, like what you might expect from a Mass Effect game...   The new art style is fine. It's the poor animation that looks bad.  Much ado was made of the new art style for Mass Effect Galaxy. Honestly, the stylized, comic book-like direction doesn't bother me at all. I don't mind looking at universes through different lenses. The drawings are smart and clean. What is unfortunate, though, is the weak animation. Either do it right or don't do it at all. There are little half-animations throughout the game where Jacob will stay perfectly still, but his body just moves ahead. No leg movement. No arm movement. It looks weird. Worse, it looks cheap.  Occasionally, you hear voice work for opening lines in conversations and whatnot. These are well done. The music and sound effects are also quite good, too. If you are a Mass Effect fan, you will recognize some of the tones used when moving through menus.  In almost a cruel addition, BioWare also included a new trailer for Mass Effect 2 in Mass Effect Galaxy, available from the options menu. Warning: do not include trailers for games that the player will wish they had instead of the one in their hands.   Mass Effect Galaxy was reviewed with version 1.0.  ",

        "Title": "Metrico Review",
        "Subtitle": "Counting Problems",
        "Subheader": "By Colin Moriarty Posted: Aug 5, 2014 4:00 pm",
        "Content": "Metrico is a PlayStation Vita-exclusive puzzle game immersed in mathematics. Charts and graphs adorn its backgrounds; geometric shapes make up its platforms. And numbers? They’re everywhere. But don’t be daunted. Metrico isn’t a calculus class, and you won’t need your TI-89 in order to work your way through complex equations. Numbers simply provide the fuel that makes Metrico run. Unfortunately, for as novel a game as Metrico is, and as outrageously promising as it seemed , the final product doesn’t quite meet expectations. This is a truly unique and inspired experience, but it’s also a technically flawed one, and when Metrico started to stray away from typical controls and towards the PlayStation Vita’s motion, camera, and touch functionality, the experience quickly diminished in quality. What I truly love about Metrico is its lack of literal messaging. You’ll find and hear nary a word through its 60-plus puzzles spread across six unique worlds, leaving everything up to your own interpretation. Its side-scrolling puzzle solving seems typical, yet it’s anything but, and it’s easy to get caught up in the ambience of the world and what it might be trying (or not trying) to tell you. I read into Metrico something heady and meaningful; you may see it an entirely different way. I think that’s part of its beauty. Adding to its unique atmosphere is its tranquil soundtrack and subtle noises. When you start Metrico, it uses a graphical cue to push you towards wearing headphones instead of listening to it over the Vita’s tiny speakers or, worse yet, playing it on mute, and it’s good advice. Its masterful audio accompaniment makes Metrico, in turn, a more stimulating visual experience. While the graphics are simple, yet beautiful, and the sound is perfectly fitting, Metrico doesn’t run that well. Its framerate stutters noticeably, especially in between puzzles that are supposed to segue seamlessly, and its load times are borderline absurd, especially for a game of this size. It’s not technically ambitious, so there’s no excuse for what might be, pound for pound, the absolute worst load times I can recall on the Vita (it consistently takes over 30 seconds to load a puzzle from the puzzle select screen, for instance). Additionally, Metrico glitched out on me multiple times, forcing me to restart puzzles. I fell through environments, some puzzle elements wouldn’t turn on, and I’d die inexplicably. These problems aren’t around every corner, but in playing almost the entire campaign in one sitting, I did encounter them several times. Truly cerebral. When things work, however, solving Metrico’s puzzles is, at first, straight forward. The entire campaign hinges on your actions, and how they affect the world around you. So you may see a barrier in your way with “0/4” next to it, and another barrier beyond it with “0%” by its side. Through trial and error, you may realize that every time you jump, that “0/4” becomes “1/4” and then “2/4” until it gets out of your way. Meanwhile, that “0%” may go to “100%” by walking backwards. The interplay between these elements is truly a breath of fresh air. Deeper into the campaign, however, Metrico gets too crazy for its own good by throwing in way too many elements that take advantage of Vita’s functionality, but don’t take into account that you might be playing in public, without means to solve certain puzzles. For instance, it uses the Vita’s back-facing camera, starting off by asking you to capture light to solve puzzles. Then it demands a certain color light – red, blue, and green – to solve even more puzzles. It’s a nice idea, but it’s incredibly impractical, and reeks of short-sighted design. I had to sit on a couch with a ripped piece of green paper next to me, constantly pointing the camera at the paper, the red rug underneath me, and a blue piece of furniture nearby. What if I was on the train? On a plane? In a car? Playing in bed, in the dark? What would I do then? I could have sworn we learned these lessons with another promising game held back by gimmicks in the form of Sony Bend’s otherwise excellent Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Metrico also falls prey to poor touch control, something not all that uncommon on the Vita. You’ll eventually be given the power to shoot projectiles in order to solve puzzles, but aiming requires the use of finicky back touch controls that frustrated me often. Its puzzles are so clever; Metrico doesn’t need all of these extra bells and whistles to shine. The fact that they’re included actively walks everything back from greatness. Technical issues and gimmicky controls injure Metrico's beauty. With so many ways to interact with an otherwise straight-forward puzzler, more complicated puzzles with lots of elements quickly became exercises in figuring out what to do to the Vita to make everything click. I’d shake the Vita to figure out if it was motion-based, I’d get up and put the Vita in front of a light to see if the camera had anything to do with it, and I’d tap the touch screen for good measure. It all became exhausting after a while. I wanted to immerse myself in Metrico, because its aesthetics and message beg you to do so, but some of its more gimmicky controls are, unfortunately, totally unimmersive. Fortunately, I can’t deny that solving all of Metrico’s puzzles – which took me an afternoon, for the most part – gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Some of the puzzles are very complicated and require you to look at things in a totally different way, especially as you get deeper and deeper into it. And I also love the so-called “choice” you have at the end of the six worlds, where you’re given two doors to go through with no explanation whatsoever, with nothing but a graph showing you the decisions other players in the world made (The Walking Dead: The Game-style). Its Trophy roster – full of all hidden Trophies – is also enticing, especially because I only earned a couple of them the entire time I played. I’m intrigued by what kind of crazy things you have to do to earn them all.",

        "Content": "For anyone who’s ever watched a monster movie and thought “Hey, it would be pretty cool to be that monster,” the premise of Carrion is immediately appealing. It’s a power fantasy that has you going an utter rampage through an underground facility, terrorizing both armed and unarmed inhabitants along the way. Developer Phobia Game Studio is uncompromising in its approach to making Carrion as true to this fantasy as possible, and it makes for a game unlike any I’ve played thanks to a collection of truly excellent moments. Even when the novelty of grabbing a helpless scientist and slamming them all around a room, Hulk-style, wore off, Carrion’s puzzles and cerebral combat encounters still kept me thoroughly entertained. The monotony that lurks between them, however, is the real monster.   If there’s one thing that Carrion nails, it’s the movement and abilities of its leading amorphous, multi mouthed, tentacled monstrosity. The monster has total freedom of movement, with its appendages automatically shooting out and pulling it toward whatever direction you point it in. It’s delightfully creepy to watch and there’s a great speed and fluidity to its movements, which is important because hit-and-run tactics are crucial when dealing with the more dangerous weapon-wielding enemies you’ll encounter.  You can control one of your tentacles via the right stick and grab either enemies or pieces of the environment with the right trigger. Enemies can be consumed for health and extra biomass, or slammed and tossed around like rag dolls; bits of the environment can be hurled across the room; and doors can be ripped right from their hinges. It’s hard not to crack a devilish smile when you’re able to creep down on an enemy from the ceiling, quickly pull them up, eat their top half, and drop their lower half down for the rest of the people in the room to freak out about.  Carry On  As you progress through the underground facility, you’ll unlock strains of DNA that add new abilities to your repertoire, such cloaking, growing blades and charging through barricades, and most notably, parasitically controlling a human. In typical Metroidvania fashion, these abilities typically have both a combat use and a navigational use, and every time you get a new ability you’ll be able to explore previously closed-off sections of the map.  10 Carrion Gameplay Screenshots 10 Images  The best Metroidvanias manage to hide worthwhile upgrades and secrets to encourage backtracking and exploration whenever you get a new ability. This is one pro tip Carrion doesn’t follow in that there are only nine mostly useless, optional upgrades. Worse still, searching for them is a nightmare because of how easy it is to get lost. There’s no map to consult, no reminder of your current objective, and no waypoint or hint system to guide you. At one point I backtracked to access a previously blocked off area, only to find that all it did was provide a useless shortcut. Then I found myself hopelessly lost in a cleaned-out facility for an absolutely miserable two or so hours of aimless wandering.  My first blind playthrough took about six hours. My second took a little over two “  On my second playthrough, I could see that there is a fairly cleanly laid-out path to follow to get from main objective to main objective, but any deviation from that path makes it very hard to find your way back because you don’t know what those main objectives are. Just to illustrate how much of an issue this was, my first blind playthrough took about six hours. My second took a little over two.  Rip and Tear  It’s worth repeating that the actual moment-to-moment gameplay of Carrion is excellent. There are some very cleverly laid-out encounters that offer a ton of freedom in terms of how you literally pick apart your prey, and while it’s pretty easy early on, in the later bits it ups the ante significantly with armored mechs, fast drones that can rip you to shreds, and flamethrower-wielding soldiers who will have you rushing to the nearest body of water if they manage to set you on fire.  Whats Your Favorite \"Be The Monster Game?\" Dead by Daylight Maneater Carrion Prototype Predator: Hunting Grounds Other Answer See Results  As far as the story goes, there isn’t much of one to speak of, but that actually works in Carrion’s favor. From the start until the end, the perspective never shifts away from the monster, outside of a couple of quick flashback sequences that provide some context for its origin. That makes it kind of a fun and unique way to experience the increasingly dire state of your human adversaries, as presented through emergency bulletins and LED signs.",

        "Content": "is a disaster. It's an unfinished, unpolished, and un-fun game that I thankfully never have to play again. My plan now involves placing it in a paper sack, lighting said sack on fire, placing it on old man Jocob's doorstep, ringing the bell, and watch him get the dirty thing all over his shoes when he tries to stamp it out. Finally I'll get some entertainment out of this ill begotten RPG. There are so many problems that it's hard to know where to begin. Should we talk about simple things like collision problems or perhaps the lack of imagination in the art? How about the missing character customization and automap features? Maybe we should instead focus on combat and why it's not fun? The bugs could also present a fun topic. Wherever we start, it's not going to be pretty.  The game is set in a fantasy world of dragons, goblins, elves (half of whom seem to be Asian), and wizards. There's an evil threatening to wrap the land in its oh so gloomy embrace and only one man, woman, and/or monster can stop it. An evil wizard is conspiring with a malevolent entity in order to grow in power, but like most evil wizards, this particular one can't see the $#!*storm brewing on the horizon. The story itself isn't terrible and I've certainly heard worse. But the fact that there are no memorable characters to interact with makes the progression wholly uninspiring. The lack of wit, humor, or real drama in the writing and voice-overs simply helps waning interest levels fall faster than they would have otherwise.  The absence of polish and attention to detail is a big reason for Dungeon Lords ' failing. Rooms are filled with next to nothing ( actually nothing in the case of inn rooms that don't even have beds for crying out loud) giving the impression that some thief just scurried out with a gigantic bag of goodies without anyone noticing. Huge halls that should be decorated with statues, items, candles, and banners are completely empty of the stuff that makes worlds come alive as are most other inhabited areas. In an herbalist shop, you'd expect a cramped room with stacks of stuff on the shelves, not a giant room with one bare counter and dully textured walls. Perhaps more amazing are the long load times to get into one of these boxy and bare bones interiors.    The outdoor world is a pretty big environment, but when it's filled with nothing of real interest, it's hard to care. Running from place to place (until you can teleport using the abnormally nifty looking Moon Gates) is tedious as can be. There need to be points of interest scattered along the way, close enough to the road to attract some interest. Exploring the environment is as unrewarding as can be, especially considering the lack of an automap (which makes me want to punch things) to help navigate confusing areas. The paper map that ships with the games helps a little, but only so that you can find a boundary and follow it in a direction to the \"road\" or one of the horrifically bad bodies of water to get some real bearing.  Once outside of the decent starting city, the journey immediately turns depressing. The mighty city of the elves is only four or five buildings strong, each of which is a big blocky blight on the landscape, with no pathways or signs leading from place to place and a population of around nine elves. There was just no attention given to designing the world to make it fun, interesting, or real . When you can't make an elven city or dragon roosting ground exciting or recognizable compared to the rest of the world, there's something seriously wrong with the creative process being used.  The absence of art could also stem from the lack of technology to support it. The draw distance is one of the shortest I've seen lately (which can compound the \"get lost in the forest\" routine) and environmental detail isn't the spectacular. All you need to do is look at the water for the heartiest laugh the game wasn't supposed to provide. Water in large bodies like lakes, as a general physical rule, tends to lay flat across a surface aside from waves. But somehow Dungeon Lords has you swimming uphill and downhill in the middle of a lake. It's absolutely bizarre that someone would see this and think it looked good in any way shape or form.   I don't know how big the art team working on the game was, but it clearly wasn't big enough. There wasn't enough time to create content to fill out the world, even with all of the delays. The best looking parts of the game are some of the characters and monsters. My hero dwarf certainly looked decent, at least until he was running around in form fitting plate armor, which simply made him look ridiculous.  While most models look okay, they're animated without any real personality for the type of creature they are. The relative void of imagination in the enemy types could have been saved by fluid and detailed animations, but that's just not the case. Even the main character is sadly underwhelming, especially considering the animations are stock for each of the races available for play (aside from a little tail swinging for those with tails). Zooming the camera out as far as it goes helps a bit in the outdoor areas, which makes me think that maybe Heuristic Park should have considered creating an isometric RPG like Dungeon Siege instead of a third-person action game. Being up close and personal in Dungeon Lords does nothing to help visual impressions.  The lack of lively animations helped contribute to some seriously sad combat. I know these guys may not have the resources as the guys that created Blade of Darkness , God of War , or even Oni , but if you're going to have an action combat game today, there has to be a more visceral appeal to melee combat. You can feel the combat happening in those other games, even if the systems weren't always the best. It never even comes close here.  Melee combinations involve three or four moves strung together in different ways that end up in a twirl and stab motion that made me embarrassed to play the game. The combos are too weak and the impact of hitting someone with a powerful sword stroke just isn't there. Even Fable , which doesn't have the most advanced combo system in the gaming world, feels worlds better than this. You need knock downs, decapitations, stabbings, and the like with combos or some kind of special abilities. Melee combat basically boils down to hitting the button a lot while running in circles and hitting the quick button for healing potions when necessary, especially considering the amount of enemies around you much of the time.    Melee is backed up with both ranged martial skills and magic. Shooting a bow or throwing weapons was even more boring than melee and I quickly abandoned it. I was never able to find a bow to do damage strong enough to make that option worth the price, especially considering that there was no over-the-shoulder manual aim option for targeting heads for quick kills. Magic is broken up into several categories that make combat a little more fun, but doesn't seem balanced particularly well. It was simply easier to hack through people with a sword than summon pathetic creatures as help or throw spells around that ran out of charges too quickly.  What's especially frustrating is that instead of fighting intelligently designed creatures a couple at a time in interesting situations, Dungeon Lords simply randomly spawns most of its creatures in gigantic packs on the fly. Every time that happens, the game chunks visibly and you'll be assaulted. There's barely a hint of real intelligence from enemies making combat an unfortunate exercise of fast clicking without thinking. In comparison, Blade of Darkness (or even Gothic , which has a debatable combat system) presented designed situations where more skill than blind luck and click speed matter and those are both several years old. There's something to be said about having some random encounters, but they're just awful at timed intervals and shouldn't even be an issue in dungeons, which should all be designed down to the details.

        "Subheader": "By Richard Cobbett Posted: Dec 18, 2014 10:07 pm",
        "Content": "Like most of the best zombie fiction, Dead State is an old-lkschool RPG that’s no more about its zombies than a disaster movie is about the asteroid impact, tsunami, or earthquake. The event is important; they’ve changed everything. But it’s the people that the story is about, and especially the small group that you’re in charge of, all huddled in your little scrap of safety. It’s your job to feed and protect them by heading out in search of supplies and other survivors, but also to keep them sane and safe and away from each other’s throats while back at home. The result is a clever, if undeniably clunky mix of both genres and past zombie games we’ve seen that is absolutely going to be some peoples’ favourite of the year… but also one that, like a brain-hungry zombie trying to chomp down on Stephen Hawking, bites off more than it can chew.  15 Images The bulk of Dead State takes place in two phases, not entirely unlike a combination of Fallout and X-COM - RPG-style journeys into a world of zombies and tooled-up survivors for the food and weapons you need, and a management layer where you worry about building fences and rationing supplies and dealing with everyone’s problems. One character, for instance, starts out suicidal and has to be talked back over the course of several conversations, while food and fuel and morale ebb and flow on a daily basis. Should a teammate be bitten (your character is immune) then you need antibiotics to hold off the infection, or they’ll become zombified and have to be put down. It doesn’t matter if they’re your only medic, or your best fighter - they’re gone forever. Conversely, fail to keep up morale and confidence and they might ultimately relieve you of command. With a bullet. This part really shows Dead State at its best, due to being able to focus on plot and character and simple decisions with interesting repercussions. A big board lets you assign tasks each morning, from building structures like a watchtower or well, to crafting guns and chemicals, to cleaning up or teaching a non-English speaker enough to get by. Each of the characters is superbly written with very strong personalities, from a mother and daughter team who desperately want to keep the other out of harm, to Doug, a nerd discovering that a zombie apocalypse isn’t as awesome as he always thought. The more survivors join the group, the more the political side comes into play: crisis decisions must be made, impromptu interruptions like a party member getting sick and asking for the day off, different ideas on what the group should focus on, and being the final arbiter of on things like whether, for instance, the creepy zombie-killing obsessive should be kicked out or put to use. If things get really bad, you also unlock the option to deal with troublemakers by gunning them down personally. All this is great stuff, even with a few annoying issues like characters just rehashing the same dialogue when not actively coming to you, some mornings consisting of a conga-line of people demanding decisions, and the same person occasionally returning just to go from “I just wanted to tell you you’re great” to “By the way, you suck and you’ll kill us all.” This is just one of many glitches and rough edges that alternately amuse and irritate, with a highlight being the combat descriptors often leading to zombies with labels like “Dead Man - Almost Dead.” The catch is the work between these bits can be a real chores. Inventory management shouldn’t be a bigger headache than filling the stock cupboard, and not just because Dead State’s UI practically defines ‘clunky’, ‘slow’ and ‘bloody awful.’ And it’s an odd survival game where the big quandary of the day soon goes from “How do we eat tonight?” but “Who gets first dibs on the deodorant?” Yet it’s all for nothing, basically - while it’s possible to lose due to poor management, it takes so long and the world is so conveniently bursting with supplies that it’s actually pretty difficult to do unless you literally do nothing for day after day after day. By far the biggest chore, though, tends to be what should be the most interesting: heading out into the zombie-infested world. Again, it plays much like the original Fallout, complete with random encounters, a map that slowly unfolds as your ability to explore increases, and turn-based tactical combat – but unlike Fallout’s world, this is an incredibly bland one, with little personality and an oddly lacking sense of danger. Zombies just stand around the map unless triggered by sound, making the sensible way of defeating them just picking them off one or two at a time until you get to the point where they’re irrelevant. Humans are far bigger threats due to their guns, but no more mobile, and so usually just as easily avoided until you’re ready. Even early on it’s rare to feel in trouble unless forced into a fight, though it is possible to get swamped if things get noisy. Another big distinction from Fallout is that fighting anyone, alive or dead, is a miserable experience. The turn-based combat doesn’t offer even the most basic tactical features like overwatch or interesting terrain elements to position your party around, turning each encounter into a slow-paced exercise in trading blows. Indoor locations are far too cramped, outside ones typically too empty. Characters’ action-point allocations too are rarely generous enough to do anything with except take a couple of swings or run for it. Glitches are in full force here too – from smashing a door occasionally being treated as beating up a neutral human, to it making no distinction between neutral and hostile Looters until they open fire. In both of these cases of course, you’re treated as if you beat up a puppy for fun. The result of all this is that essential scavenging soon becomes a very tedious, map-scouring chore. It is, however, regularly uplifted by occasional bursts of story in the field, with writing just as solid as that in the safehouse. Instances like the man in a restaurant who waits for you to offer shelter before springing the fact that he also has an elderly woman and a young boy who would like to take up that most generous offer create interesting dilemmas. These moments are rare enough to feel special, but common enough that entering a new location always has potential. More Reviews Dec 6, 2017 Rocket League Review – Updated Dec 6, 2017 - What a save!

        "Subtitle": "Hollow Knight’s rich world and incredible depth of content will make you want to explore its caves for dozens of hours.",
        "Subheader": "By Tom Marks Updated: Jun 27, 2024 9:30 pm",
        "Content": "It’s not hard to get lost in the deep, subterranean world of Hollow Knight – and I mean that in more ways than one. The expansive catacombs of Hallownest have countless paths to explore and secrets to find. But more than that, it’s rich with lore, history, and purpose that drew me into a 2D Metroidvania kingdom I wanted to uncover every inch of. The deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it has to offer. I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect, and secrets to uncover. But what’s truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, sound, and a million other little details combine to give each area of the map a distinct sense of place, and those areas jigsaw together in a way that feels intentional and alive. label=World%20Wide%20Web There are far more of these distinct biomes than I ever expected to discover, and the edges of each one blend together with the next in ways that help them make sense in the world. For example, walls on the border of the Fungal Wastes, even impassable ones in other areas, will be dotted with its telltale mushrooms. The lush environment of an area called Greenpath feels bustling and humid, a stark difference to the cold, dark caves of the Forgotten Crossroads. The bubble-filled region of Fog Canyon isn’t technically underwater, but the muffled filter over all of its audio goes hand-in-hand with jellyfish enemies and a brighter blue tone. Hallownest’s capital city, the City of Tears, is a metropolis in a huge cave where it’s always raining. But it wasn’t until 10 hours after I first discovered this place that I stumbled across the Blue Lake, a massive body of serene water positioned just above the underground city. Hollow Knight doesn’t shove this connection in your face, it just lets you explore its world and piece together the story for yourself as you sit down and enjoy a moment of quiet. Hollow Knight's larger story is told in a subtle way, but its lore is so deep that I feel like I could write a book on it. In fact, Hollow Knight tells you very little about what’s going on, and instead sends you into a world full of monumental events that all happened long before you arrived: wars and heroes, love and culture, disease and destruction. The aftermath of Hallownest’s troubled past is left for you to discover and comes through loud and clear, but only if you take the time to listen. It’s told in a very subtle way, but teaches you so much about Hallownest in the process that I feel like I could practically write a book on it. It’s a tragic tale, one full of fallen heroes and terrible decisions, but it still manages to make time for beautiful, calm, and hopeful moments throughout. And it’s easy to enjoy those moments, because Hollow Knight’s hand-drawn art is simply beautiful. It’s a world that manages to feel cohesive despite its citizens being adorable bug-people in a dying cave. The story (and your place in it) is picked up as you go. Some of it through dialogue with the adorable and quirky characters who still reside in this decrepit kingdom, some through important story events, and some just by observing your surroundings and the clues strewn about it. After my second playthrough, I have a fairly clear picture of Hallownest’s history, but it’s a picture I assembled myself. As much as I genuinely loved being pushed out of the boat and told to start kicking, Hollow Knights’ first few hours can be a predictably sink-or-swim experience as a result. It’s an unashamedly challenging game that does a great job of silently teaching you how to play, but it still felt a little bit daunting to start — especially when death means having to fight your way back to your corpse to reclaim your money, called Geo. You have to find a map seller named Cornifer in each area before you can start keeping track of where you’ve been, and even then you have to equip a specific charm to see where you are on it in real time. That, coupled with fact that getting good at the combat takes practice, means I spent my first couple hours just trying to figure Hollow Knight out. But once I picked up the rhythm of its combat and the pattern of exploring its initially restrictive cave systems, Hollow Knight clicked in a way that made me never want to put it down. After Greenpath, the second major area, you reach a point where there’s no clear “correct” direction anymore. Like any Metroidvania, your path options are gated behind things like ledges too high to reach or gaps too far to jump until you find the necessary upgrades, but there are enough options that don’t result in dead ends to keep to you exploring for quite a while. Hidden around the Kingdom of Hallownest are traditional Metroidvania abilities like a dash and a wall climb to help you better navigate its caves and reach new places. These new movement abilities also allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain faster and more efficiently, giving the obligatory need to retread old ground (which does happen a fair amount) fresh life. Suddenly your wall climb turns that small gap between platforms into a shortcut instead of a hazard. New movement abilities allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain, giving the obligatory need to retread old ground fresh life. Thankfully, there is also a flavor-filled quick-travel system called the Stagways. Stag stations can be found and unlocked across Hallownest, allowing you to call The Last Stag to take you between them. What could just be a jump between points instead becomes a quest in itself, and I almost always spoke to The Stag after unlocking a station not to travel, but to hear his gruff but optimistic take on whatever new stop I brought him to. Hollow Knight’s world also undergoes more concrete changes as you progress. Railways and elevators will unlock permanently, opening shortcuts that loop back to earlier sections and easing the burden of backtracking. One early area eventually even morphs into a much harder late-game section in a way that makes it feel like your actions in Hallownest have real weight. label=Hammer%20Meets%20Nail The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky as you learn to time quick directional sword slashes with jumps and dashes. It rewards patience and skill massively — killing enemies is a matter of sharp timing, learning attack patterns, and having quick reflexes more than just the upgrades you earn along the way. You can find upgrades to your weapon damage, increase your max health, and equip charms with a variety of abilities, but more importantly, I just got better as I went. A boss that gave me tons of trouble at the start of the game was a pushover when I returned for a second playthrough. And while your timing requires precision, the combat itself is somewhat forgiving. Hitting enemies lets you collect a resource called Soul which you can stop and channel at any time to heal, as long as you don’t get hit. So while the all-or-nothing nature of dropping your Geo on death gives exploration a sweaty-palmed tension, Hollow Knight also gives you the tools to take a breath, gather Soul, and get your health back up. There are a decent amount of smaller enemies scattered around each level as well, acting as weaker baddies that let you recover Soul and collect Geo in relative safety. But there are just as many scary opponents too, and dying far from a checkpoint is a real risk. The enemy variety is impressive to say the least, with nearly 100 different types to fight, and even ones with similar behaviors looking dramatically different depending on what area of the map you find them in. A charm system allows you to customize your own methods for killing those enemies as well. Each charm takes up a set number of notches (which you can earn more of along the way) and range from small effects, like extending your attack distance or gathering more Soul on hits, to large trade-off changes, like doubling your health but preventing you from healing at all, which can dramatically change how you play. Thankfully, you can freely swap them out whenever you sit at a bench, which also serve as Hollow Knight’s save points and healing stations. That meant I could come up with specific combinations to counter different scenarios on the fly. I had my favorite loadout for general use, a loadout that upped the amount of Geo I got and collected it automatically, and a loadout for moving more quickly. If you prefer using Hollow Knight’s Soul-consuming damage abilities instead of swinging your sword (called a Nail) you could equip charms that increase Soul damage and even change your attacks entirely. For some harder boss fights that didn’t give me an opportunity to heal, my loadout even shifted to maximizing my temporary health at the cost of unequipping charms I had grown to rely on. Through all that experimentation, it never felt like there was a wrong choice. All the charms are good, and they all work, and it’s up to you to determine which you like the most and which work best for the scenario in front of you. And if any situation will push you to test those choices out, it will likely be one of Hollow Knight’s copious amount of boss fights. Seriously: there are dozens of different bosses, ranging from small and quick enemies to large, deadly brutes. These contained challenges are some of the best thrills available because they force you to find a strategy, learn when it’s safe to attack or heal, and get better each time you get crushed Because believe me, you will get crushed. Those hard losses occasionally slowed my momentum, but there is almost always some other path to explore. If I was having trouble pushing through in one direction, I’d just wander down another until I got stronger (or just better) and decided to face that tough fight again. label=Soul-Searching%20For%20Secrets In fact, a staggering amount of Hollow Knight’s best content is entirely optional. You could probably beat the campaign without seeing two-thirds of what it has to offer, though the quest to get an alternate (and much better) ending will pull you in front of significantly more. Bosses, thoughtful story, and whole sections of the map can remain hidden, which adds to that feeling of actually exploring this world when you do stumble upon them. None of Hollow Knight's optional content feels like filler. The key here is that none of this optional content feels like filler. I actively wanted to find every secret I possibly could and learn what was actually going on in the story. It all felt unique, significant, and wonderfully put together. Even after the 30+ hours it took me to truly beat Hollow Knight, I was excited to go back for more. Having so much to do at any given time can admittedly be overwhelming at points. There can be so many open paths on your map that the burden of deciding which to explore next can make you doubt which is the “right” way. But the beauty of Hallownest is that there is very rarely a right or wrong choice, and it’s unlikely two players will explore these caves in the same order. Hollow Knight has also been getting free post-launch content updates since its launch on PC last year, all of which are included on Switch (and more updates are on the way, according to developer Team Cherry). Those patches have added new areas and new bosses, and one even added the ability to add custom markers to your map. The simple act of being able to visually track when I need to revisit an area or which paths I’ve yet to go down is a godsend. It has helped me take stock of what needs to be done alongside the other late-game amenities Hollow Knight makes available for completionists, like maps that will eventually track certain collectibles. But so much of what’s worth finding past the point where you can “beat” Hollow Knight is pure, concentrated lore. To really get a picture of what you’re doing (and to properly inform an important choice you have to make) you need to explore. I love that those key moments in the story tie into some of the best gameplay challenges it has to offer as well. For example, one of the final secret areas basically transforms Hollow Knight into a Super Meat Boy-style platformer with very little combat. Platforming challenges exist all throughout the world, with some of the most thrilling requiring you to use your Nail as a pogo stick while you bounce across spikes, Duck Tales-style — but this area is something else entirely, and tells you about the history of that location with its themes. And, as I mentioned before, the music adds to that setting and art one thousand times over. While each location has its own theme and boss fight music, individual melodies and instruments will shift in and out as you move from screen to screen. The mood and tension of a scene are often driven by that music, and the soundtrack has quickly become one of my favorites. Where to Buy Hollow Knight - Switch 0 $35.99  save 17% $29.77 at Amazon",

        "Subtitle": "Could it be that Acclaim made a good South Park game?",
        "Subheader": "By Nix Updated: Dec 13, 2018 2:51 am Posted: Jan 7, 2000 1:00 am",
        "Content": "Fat flippin' chance. Gameplay When Acclaim locked down the South Park license and started brainstorming concepts, the dimmest light bulb to ever to hover above a man's head struck with a cartoon flicker, sputter, hum, and dull spark: Let's make a mascot kart title! Genius! Oh, it doesn't play well? What do you mean? Why, there are 30 characters! And over six tracks! (That's right, seven tracks.) Just look at the massive weapon arsenal -- there's exploding diarrhea, barf, talking poo, anal probes, horny pupies, roadkill rodents, underwear burglars, irritating dictators, pinkeye, STD-raging whores, and farting canooks! DUDE! THIS GAME GOT'S EVERYTHING!!! No. South Park Rally has \"got's\" nothing at all. Acclaim's latest South Park licensed game sucks, just like the last one, and the one before that, and probably the ones still to come too. Acclaim has even taken all of the fun out of the game for me, a reviewer, as they've given me very little to single out as pathetic -- there's nothing especially laughable about the game, it's just so mediocre on all levels that nothing ever comes together. Developer Tantalus (who aren't even credited on the box -- that's harsh!) did try to implement some different, if not original or intelligent, ideas. In a lackadaisical effort to reinvent the wheel, the tracks are open courses rather than single-direction courses with shortcuts. That did three things for the game: one, it made the design more open, as the checkpoints can be randomly moved; second, it made the courses more practical for a budget game company on an unattainable schedule, so Tantalus was able to use the same tracks for different event contests rather than just racing (and it also bailed them out of having to design separate battle tracks); and third, it made the game impossible to play. Tracks are so huge, so pointlessly arraigned, and so utterly confusing that you'll have to practice a track several times while following the computer opponent just to know what the hell to do (and the game doesn't encourage practice, as AI cars can't be turned off, and you can't finish your race once one opponent has captured the win). Of course, there is an inset map to try to help you find your way, but multi-layered courses defeat its purpose, and even if you do rely upon it, gamers are still bound to feel lost in the haphazardly designed courses. The first course -- a race set in a town with streets that lead nowhere and a ludicrous architecture that always leads you in the wrong direction with every turn -- is the single worst track I have ever seen in a racer. Later tracks get better, but none have any sense of logic or reason to the design. Also innovative and yet thoroughly botched in this game is the addition of objectives in the place of standard flag-to-flag racing. While some of the events (capture the flag-type games, frag tag-type events, seek and deliver races) are good ideas, the execution is messed up by lack of insight on the designer's part. There is no strategy. When you need to hide from opponents with the flag, the size of the tracks makes you a hot dog in a hallway; when you're hunting opponents, same problem. The vicious, mechanical computer AI is always set to kill, so in frag tag (called Valentine's Day) you can't get far enough away to pick them off. Even if you try to play camper in a capture the flag event and snipe the leader just before he crosses the finish line, the pack will be always right behind him to snag the prize. Imagine a football game where the focus isn't on passing or running but rather on coming up with fumbled balls on the line of scrimmage. The only smart element of the design is in the weaponry, which is made up of numerous popular tokens and cameos from the TV show. Nothing's new here -- Barf makes you slip like a Oil in Diddy Kong Racing, Mr. Hankey makes you invincible just like the Tiki God in Crash Team Racing, Water Balloons detonate like Mortars in Twisted Metal, Terrance & Phillip makes you fart turbo like the Dash in Chocobo Racer (did I just say that?), and Pinkeye works like Lightening in Mario Kart. Also included are two view-obscuring items, one with Sadam Hussein taking over your screen, the other a slut hooker who leaves her herpes all over your windshield if you hit her. Yet even if you credit the game for its massive arsenal, it's not hard to realize that the vast majority of the weapons are similar (missile, boost, or bomb) with only a graphic and audio difference. That slight bit of ingenuity is contrasted against terrible tracks, 1980's AI, and baffling gameplay. The strategy of the entire game is exactly like playing a game of Pac-Man -- learn the simple AI path routines, run the courses exactly according to those lines (always a step ahead of your foe or you're dead), and snack on a couple foes once you've become invincible. Certainly you can't rely on the power of the car or driver you've chosen to lead you to victory, since all the cars and vehicles are essentially the same (some drive a little floatier or heavier, or so I am led to believe, but nothing about your choice ever matters -- just choose the one who curses the most). And if you don't find enough to fault in the flawed design, race the game a little bit and you'll find all kinds of poor track features that trap you for a while, and even an assortment of bugs -- twice I ran into a flat wall and found myself (and the game) completely locked up. Graphics Boxy, chunky, blocky, simple, flat. All words to describe the show and the game South Park. We'll give the developer's a break here in that South Park doesn't exactly lend itself too well to gorgeous graphics. It's a simple show with simple effects and cheesy design. True, the special effects here are just sad (especially Big Gay Al's Disco Room, with a two-step moving texture), but they are true to the show. Every character ever on the show (except Craig and perhaps one or two other third-season additions) is in the game. From Scuzzlebutt to Jesus Christ to the hot-flashing hoe Ms. Cartman, the gang's all here. Many characters even have secondary outfits (Cartman as a cop on a big wheel, Chef as the Braveheart turkey hunter). To be fair even, environments are fairly complex, and the draw-in isn't noticeable often. My only question is why all this simplicity can't run at a good frame rate. The game is choppy, and while it doesn't bog down in two player (no four player?!?), it never looks very clean. Also, the game just isn't attractive to the eye. While the design team has emulated the show fairly well, nothing is very appealing (except maybe on the final track on the edge of hell, which finally has some color). Colors are, like Chef's Love Shack, gaudy and grating sometimes, dreary and sparse other times. While the graphics are faithful to the show in theory, there is none of that spirit or simplistic joy that you get from watching South Park. Sound If there was any one category to focus in on for a design team on a South Park game, it would be this one.  Lots of sounds are traveling all over the place, and they're fairly funny samples. Ones that made me chuckle were the whore (who solicits as she seeks), the underpants gnomes (who sing their song as they travel), and the anal probe (which turns opponents into Broadway singers with cupie-doll faces). Quite a feat to get all of those samples, as well as the voices of all the characters on the course, into the PlayStation's memory. However, sound samples are so miserably recorded that one can easily see how they shoehorned these samples in. These tracks are so low quality that often you can't understand characters' voices. And one last gripe, one that shows just how completely, inexplicably, and even bedazzlingly bad and rushed the programming on this game is: you can hardly hear any of it. The game has no volume. The TV must be turned way up to get any volume out of the soundtrack. Sure, there's a music and SFX volume adjustment, but even maxed out the sounds hardly raise above the noise level of the hissing of the peaked speakers. Turn the channel after giving up on the game, and you'll likely get blasted out of the room. It's a strange phenomenon in gaming, a failure I can't remember seeing in quite a while. That's what you get with rushed programming on a carelessly designed and conceived project.",

        "Title": "Wheelman Review",
        "Subtitle": "Why, Vin? Why?",
        "Subheader": "By Greg Miller Updated: May 11, 2012 8:42 pm Posted: Mar 25, 2009 4:04 pm",
        "Content": "I don't think my expectations were too high for Wheelman . As a man who enjoys the occasional crappy action film, I came into Wheelman expecting cheesy Vin Diesel dialogue, an unbelievable story and lots of explosions. What I got was a whole lot more -- and not much of it was good. Sure, there's an abundance of cheesy Vin Diesel dialogue and fiery moments, but there's also the complete lack of story, mentally handicapped enemies, a repetitive city and some lame missions.  In short, this is not an interactive The Fast and The Furious. That saddens me.  Wheelman is an apparent undercover mission in Barcelona starring Vin Diesel. I say \"apparent\" because the story is pretty much never explained with the exception of a short cutscene at the beginning of the game. Vin just meets some dude from an agency who hands him a folder of info and vaguely mentions a world-ending thing that's in Spain. From there, you're Vin's undercover persona Milo, a no-nonsense driver for all sorts of bad guys. Throughout the game, you'll tear through the streets of Barcelona chasing a document in a tube, a guy named Felipe and more, but you'll never have any idea why the hell you're doing this thanks to the nonexistent story this game packs.  Seriously -- I'm an undercover agent, but I have no idea what group I'm working with. I get profiles of characters from the RAI between missions but I causally told some dude I worked for the CIA at one point. Who am I really working for? Who knows! Why would the CIA come to Barcelona? Who cares! All I know is there are three factions of bad people in the city and I need to work with them all to find the big thing. That's it. These are pretty big storytelling flaws.  Cue the Blues Brothers music.  Making this feeling of detachment even worse is the fact that this is a botched take on the open-world environment. See, you can get through the so-called story of Wheelman in about eight hours, but this is designed to be like the sandbox world of Grand Theft Auto. OK, that's a lie; it seems like this game is designed to be a direct knockoff of GTA. When you pull up the world map on your PDA, you'll see green icons for story-based missions and then a number of colored icons for the seven categories of side missions -- stuff such as driving people to certain places in a Taxi, taking out your opponents in Rampage and escaping your pursuers in Fugitive.  What makes this feel disconnected is the fact that these things just pop up without any rhyme or reason. When you choose to do a cabbie mission, you just teleport into a car that's already got a passenger. Why are you smashing into other cars? Just because you want to, I guess. Sure, the missions can give you upgrades and such, but how does that make sense in this world? There's no in-game economy, so you're not earning money for these tasks; you're just doing them to do them and get the best rank. You don't feel like you're a part of this city. It's just a bunch of random instances in a sun-bathed Spanish town.  One of the greatest things about any of the GTAs was connecting with the city you were inhabiting -- knowing shortcuts, tight turns, or where people lived. You'll never get this in Wheelman because you can just jump to any mission you feel like. You pull up the PDA, select the mission you want and you can be warped to that spot. You don't need to drive there; you can just travel through space and time. This leads to you not knowing or caring about the city, but honestly, there's nothing to know or care about. Barcelona is colorful and bright, but it's wholly forgettable. Every street looks like the one before it with a few notable landmarks here and there. Just about everything's destructible, which is a nice touch because you'll be smashing through all sorts of crap, but none of it looks that good. In fact, when I was tearing through a patch of dirt, the mud my rear tires kicked up was so blocky that I could've sworn it was pulled from a PlayStation 2 game.   Yeah, I wouldn't want the moped either. Still, Wheelman isn't a complete failure -- there are some fun parts once you accept there's no story and the city is dead. What the game actually has going for it are a few completely over-the-top, unrealistic elements involving its vehicles. When Milo's barreling down the street and coming up on a car, you can hold down the Airjack button and watch a red arrow appear over the vehicle in front of you. When that triangle turns green, you let go of the button and Milo will leap from your ride to the new car in slow motion. That's right -- he's jumping forward from a speeding car to another vehicle that's going slower. Either upon impact or (oddly) after he's already jumped through the window, you'll see some shattering glass and Milo will be behind the wheel. It's completely unbelievable and it looks hilarious, but this is the kind of goofball crap I was expecting in Wheelman. This is actually fun.  Another ludicrous idea the game employs but can actually be a cool is Vehicle Melee. Here, the right joystick acts as your car's hit stick. When you're rolling down the street, you can jerk the stick left, forward, or right to perform a body check in that direction; it's like your car's wheels turned 90 degrees and you're driving sideways. Sure, it could never happen in real life, but for a videogame starring Vin Diesel, I'm behind the moves. If you wear down a car, you can pull off a finisher where the camera will follow the rolling ball of flame that used to be your enemy.  Sadly, the AI you'll go up against in Wheelman will quickly drain the fun out of these nifty moves. See, everyone in Barcelona is mentally challenged. Let's look at a simple example: there's a Trophy/Achievement for surviving a five-star wanted level for five minutes (yup, they stole the star system and achievement type from GTA). When I first started my quest to get this, I'd shoot a civilian for a while to get my level up (you can't kill police or innocents in this game) and start driving when the cops gave chase. My first few times, the cops caught up to me and took down my ride in a hail of gunfire (Oddly, there's never a car to Airjack when you need there to be one in these situations.).  Then, I remembered that I was up against idiots and tried getting out of my car and running from them. This strategy worked for a few minutes because every time the cops would get close to me, they'd climb out of their cars to chase me on foot but that animation gave me enough time to get far enough away that they'd climb back in their car to chase me and repeat the process. Finally, I got cocky around the three-minute mark and tried backtracking and they shot me. On the attempt that actually scored me the honor, I just drove in a circle around a courtyard. That's right; for five minutes, I drove in the same circle around a Barcelona fountain and the game's AI couldn't figure out a way to stop me.  Jiminy Christmas.   This idiocy bleeds over into the hackneyed on-foot combat as well. Yeah, Milo can get out of his car whenever he wants to and he's going to have to do it a lot seeing as how a ton of Wheelman missions are \"drive to destination, get out of car, fight dozens of bad guys, get objective, fight back to base.\" These are the types of mechanics that grate on my nerves. It's not that these tasks were tough; it's that they're so goddamn boring. You start at the alley entrance, crouch behind some boxes and pop up to shoot. When you've cleared all the red dots off your radar, you move forward and suddenly some new dots materialize a ways in front of you. It's your job to just mow down wave after wave of these dudes and it's not hard.  Health's regenerative in Wheelman, Milo's pistol ammunition is unlimited and there are a few secondary weapons he can pick up such as the shotgun and assault rifle. Comically, Milo'll store the secondary weapon on his back, but there's no strap or anything to hold it in place. It's just inexplicably stuck to the small of his back like he's got double-sided tape back there. I guess this shouldn't surprise me because I've seen Milo do a number of flat-out amazing things in this game -- he takes phone calls in his head without holding a phone or owning a Bluetooth; when you tell him to jump out of a moving car, he'll sometimes phase through the seat and just be standing where he was driving a second ago; if you see a car you want in the distance, you hit the button and Milo telepathically stops the car and jogs over to jack it; and he walked away after getting hit by a car, where he got bent in half to the point where his heels touched the back of his head.  Where's Paul Walker?  When the bad guys get in cars, the action isn't much better. One mission had me facing off against a gang in a circular construction site and I needed to take out the leader in five minutes. However, once the leader and his cronies climbed into their vehicles, they just drove around the site in a circle. It wasn't until the five minutes were up that the bad guys tried to leave the site. Why they felt like they'd toy with Milo for five minutes when they could just take off was beyond me, but I don't think the AI thinks out any of its plans in this game. Keep in mind that you're working for three different gangs in Wheelman so that you can... um... get info on this \"device\" or whatever. I guess.  Anyway, you're helping one gang kill another gang and then immediately turning around and helping the one gang you just hurt. During the one cutscene where a gang leader called Milo on this fact, the wheelman brushed it off by saying he was just a driver. That satisfied the leader, but I'm pretty sure that's not how it works in real life. This one boss who runs a casino didn't even know I was working with the other gangs -- even after I led a lone assault on the casino that killed dozen's of the boss' men. Did he think there was another bald American who runs like he pooped his pants killing people in the streets of Barcelona?  For lots of the missions, you'll be going after a certain car or trying to get away from a group. This means that you're in a match with a handful of other vehicles and you'll need to clean their clocks using your vehicle melee skills as well as the few super-moves you have via the turbo gauge. As you pull off moves like \"speeding\" and \"handbrake turns,\" a gauge in the bottom left corner will fill with juice; you can use this power to boost or perform two types of trick shots. The first slows down the action, coats the screen in black and white, and puts you in the driver's seat so that you can shoot 180 degrees. Circles appear on the enemy vehicles during these moments so you can pull off some instant explosions and the results can be pretty satisfying.  The second move does everything I just wrote about, except this one spins the vehicle 180 degrees so that you're now face-to-face with the slow-mo enemies coming right at you. This is great for taking out bad guys who you've gotten a bit of a lead on. It usually ends with you whipping the car back to the front and crashing into some obstacle that's popped up in front of you, but it still can be cool... except for the times vehicles exploded before my bullets even got to the gas tanks.   Crrrrrazy taxi. Except not that crazy, fast, or fun. Problem is you won't get that many leads as the game goes on. For some reason, when you hit your boost, it always seems the enemies hit their's as well. This means you rarely get the chance to get way ahead of the pack and deal out some damage. Hell, in the final missions, you're just SPAMMED with enemies. You'll be on the trail to taking out these gang leaders who are holed up in one vehicle, but whenever you get the slightest chance at popping the boss, three fricking underlings will t-bone you or knock you out of your turn. It's infuriating.",

        "Content": "It’s one thing to blow up a spaceship; it’s another to dismantle it piece by piece, systematically reducing it from a hulking barge to a pile of valuable scrap. There’s a great sense of satisfaction in doing that job well, especially when performing it efficiently requires careful planning and carries a not-insignificant risk of killing yourself in a wide variety of ways in the process. Hardspace: Shipbreaker does a fine job of empowering us to carve up these gigantic space turkeys like every day is Thanksgiving and smothers it in a thick blue collar gravy, but it does wear thin with time. By the end of its campaign, the repetitive objectives and intentionally slow progression made shipbreaking start to feel like exactly what it’s simulating: hard labor. Almost immediately upon stepping into the vacuum of space, an excellent tone is set with twangy music that takes me back to an early scene of the pilot episode of 2002’s Firefly, where the crew raids a derelict ship for valuables by cutting through the hull and floating away with them. Swimming through a shipyard with a full six degrees of freedom feels serene and control is smooth, thanks in large part to the brake button that allows you to come to a stop more or less whenever you like (as long as you don't run out of thruster fuel). Physics aren't truly Newtonian, in that objects will eventually slow to a stop, but innertia is a powerful force to be reckoned with in both your own movement and when moving objects around. And while the graphics and lighting aren’t cutting edge by any means the spaceship designs are distinctive, often asymmetrical, and interesting – if I hadn’t already known that the developer, Blackbird Interactive, is also at work on Homeworld 3 , it would’ve been easy to guess. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The plot isn’t at all subtle about its comical corporate dystopia where workers are kept in indentured servitude to a tyrannical interstellar business empire that exploits them relentlessly, even resurrecting them after accidental deaths on the job so that they can continue to work off their crushing debt. There are a few good lines in there, such as a low air warning coming with a reminder that oxygen deprivation can cause a loss of company profits, but it’s largely on the nose and its humor relies entirely on that simple setup. The story that plays out over unskippable audio is equally one-note, with your faceless, mute character’s crew of salvagers being basically forced to unionize to fight back against their corporate overlords. There are twists, but they’re so clearly telegraphed that there’s not much by way of memorable moments or surprises, and the supervisor villain is a standard-issue middle-management caricature. Outside of that, there’s a fair amount of world-building lore to be found in emails and data drives you can retrieve from salvage missions, though I never came across anything revelatory. Explosive decompression can blast you into walls with enough force to splatter you like a bug on a windshield. “ Dismantling a large spaceship in zero gravity is definitely a rewarding exercise. It boils down to zapping yellow bits that join hull plates together with your cutting laser, then using your handheld tractor beam and deployable tethers to toss chunks of scrap and machinery into whichever of the red, blue, or green ports in the surrounding space station you’re told to. While certain materials can be cleaved apart freeform with your laser’s wide beam mode, most of the cutting has a paint-by-numbers feel to it because only those cut points can be disintegrated. However, upon approaching a new ship you do have to worry about explosive decompression which – if you cut into a hull improperly – can not only launch precious salvage out into space and destroy sensitive equipment, but also blast you into walls with enough force to splatter you like a bug on a windshield. Making sure to separate out different types of components takes a keen eye and the use of your suit’s sensor views if you’re trying to get the absolute maximum out of every salvage operation – that’s something I wish could be automated to a certain degree, because it’s frustrating to be penalized for missing a single light fixture or neglecting to manually detach every last computer console and door control aboard before you toss a chunk of hull into the furnace, and it becomes a chore to then hurl each of those small pieces into their own receptacle individually. What work simulator makes pretending to do a job the most fun? Microsoft Flight Simulator Eurotruck Simulator Hardspace: Shipbreaker Job Simulator Powerwash Simulator Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Where shipbreaking gets more complicated is when you’re handling the valuable reactor, which is very much like disarming a bomb. While a Type 1 reactor can simply be grabbed and tossed into the recepticle before it goes critical, more advanced versions have an order of operations that must be completed first to maximize the amount of time you have between when it’s detached from its housing and when it goes boom, causing an explosion that makes my GeForce RTX 3080 cry “uncle” as it tries to keep up with all of the resulting chunks of shrapnel. That has the same tension as figuring out whether to cut the red wire or the yellow wire on an explosive first, and mistakenly firing your cutting beam at a fuel line that hasn’t been flushed yet can instantly vaporize you (sometimes a bit unfairly, if you ask me) and spray tiny fragments of the ship’s hull everywhere. But pretty much everything is spelled out for you if you know where to look in the tooltips that pop up when you target something, so it never felt obtuse. What Shipbreaker desperately needs to keep things interesting is different objectives. “ There are several different classes of ship to dissect, each of which has its own layout, reactor configuration, and peculiarities you must learn to disassemble them efficiently. That’s a good initial challenge, but what Shipbreaker desperately needs to keep things interesting is different objectives within that – beyond simply breaking a ship down into its parts – and those rarely pop up. I enjoyed it most when I was given a secondary shopping list of parts to acquire to work on a side project, but that only goes so far and is even removed entirely for the third act for story reasons that don’t replace it with anything else to do. Also, when mysterious “ghost ships” arrived to be disassembled I was intrigued… but was let down when it turned out to be what amounted to barnacles that must be lasered off before turning in a piece of salvage. (The music takes on a nice spooky tone for those, at least.) Even when you unlock the remote-detonating demolition charges, nothing really changes because those simply allow you to destroy cut points that are rated too high for your laser – and I didn’t encounter more than a handful before I unlocked the charges. Hardspace: Shipbreaker Screenshots 25 Images As time went on in my 35-hour playthrough I wanted more variety and more pressure, or more ways to subvert the authority of the evil corporation through sabotage or other covert action, but it never came. Unlike that scene from Firefly where Mal, Zoe, and Jayne have to improvise to get back to Serenity before an Alliance ship catches them in the midst of their illegal salvage operation, in Hardspace there’s never any tension or reason to hurry beyond the threat of meaningless fees. The ships may be varied in shape and size, but every salvage operation takes place in the same spacedock facility and you’re always alone, never at risk from anything but your own carelessness. It isn’t until the final mission that the objective is shaken up at all, and that’s in the most basic of ways, with only one iteration on that idea to play with. It took me 25 ships to complete the story, with each one taking an average of an hour and a half to hack to pieces – and that, frankly, was about twice as many as I’d have expected given the amount of content here. The fees you incur by moving slowly are meaningless because Hardspace’s economy makes no sense. For the entirety of the campaign you’re trying to work your way out from under a mountain of debt $1.2 billion tall, which means that unless you’re keeping careful tabs on your ledger you might not even notice the dent that a $10 million haul makes in the total. It certainly drives home the story’s point about being effectively trapped in this Sisyphean servitude forever, especially when you finish a shift and are presented with a screen tallying up the charges you’ve incurred – such as equipment rentals and administrative fees – that take a sizable chunk of your earnings back. At the same time, when the number is so big it makes decisions like whether to buy equipment repair kits for $9,000 or to wait as long as you can to top off your thruster fuel for $10,000 per charge seem utterly inconsequential (unless you’re competing on the scoreboards for every penny in the free-play mode). You're already deep in the hole and can never run out of money to spend, so what's a little more? Besides which, it’s not like you have a choice of whether or not to buy oxygen for $16,000 per tank anyway – the alternative isn’t great. You’re always alone, never at risk from anything but your own carelessness. “ So while it purports to be all about money, and that’s what’s constantly shown in the largest fonts at every opportunity, in reality, Hardspace’s true currencies are the two types of points you earn for filling each increment on the salvage bar. One of these lets you improve your tools with mostly dull, incremental upgrades like better cooldown speeds, capacities, and durabilities that don’t do much to change how you play, while the other ranks you up, which in turn unlocks new upgrades to be purchased and progresses the story. It’s oddly camouflaged, though I suppose you could interpret that as a message that money isn’t what’s really important. But if that’s so, what’s with the time limits on shifts? Every time you go out into the shipyard you’re given a 15-minute countdown within which you’re encouraged to do as much work as possible, and at the end you’re booted back to your dormitory. Then you can simply go back to the ship you were working on in the next shift (or move onto a new one if you’re satisfied you’ve done all that’s worthwhile) with the only cost being the monetary fees associated with each outing. That makes the entire concept of getting pulled out for the end of a shift feel as pointless as the money does, and the fact that you already have to return to your base every few minutes to restock oxygen and thruster fuel makes it just another annoying interruption. Sure, your living quarters have a nice lived-in feel and it’s a nice touch that you can customize it with posters you pick up from the ships you’re salvaging, but it’s off putting to go from the freedom of zero-G movement to the oddly constricted movement system where you can’t even walk freely, only move from station to station. It should be noted that you can turn shift timers (along with oxygen and fuel limits) off in the non-standard Open Shift mode, and if I were to play through the campaign again I definitely would.",

        "Content": "Oh man, another Battle of Giants game is out? And while I was hoping the battling giants this time around would be Robots, or something equally enormous (like Greg Miller's ego), instead I was given Battle of Giants: Mutant Insects . Bad ass to be sure, but my love for making giant animals battle school buses is waning.  For those of you that don't follow Battle of Giants, or me, very closely, here's the deal. It's a series of adventure/fighting games that pit ferocious monsters against each other. The first one had dinosaurs, the second one had dragons, and the newest version feature enormous spiders and scorpions (which are totally arachnids and not insects. I know, right?).  One of the things I liked about the first two games were how different they were. the developer changed the battle system, so the games felt completely different. Mutant Insects uses a modified battle system from Dragons, so the game feels largely the same. Players use the stylus to tap a body part, then flick towards the enemy, causing their monster to attack. When attacks are landed, the game switches into a connect-the-dots microgame to build up the attack power and dish out damage. It's a simple battle system that works for little kids, and players can upgrade their bug with special attacks.  In between battles players guide their monster through the post apocalyptic wasteland that used to be earth. I'll admit, that's pretty sweet. The humans are dead, the only thing that's left are praying mantises with electrically charged claws. Totally wicked. But the levels are boring. there's nothing there except for fog, broken cars, and dirt. The game feels a lot more linear than the previous titles, forcing you onto these mazelike paths instead of letting you roam across a large level.  This game just got boring for me far quicker than the previous ones did. The bugs aren't as cool as dragons, the gameplay isn't as fresh and interesting as it was. On top of that the touch screen controls even feel less responsive, which is bad news for a game controlled entirely with the stylus.  The game features both multiple and single cartridge multiplayer (a standard for the series), so it's easy to show off to your friends your giant killer bug. That's really the best part. You can let your friends try out the battles and laugh about it, and then you're pretty much done.  It also still features secret bosses that are malevolent inanimate objects, my favorite part of the game.  Players will find school buses or giant fly swatter, and will have to use their bug to kick it's ass. It's hilarious, or at least it would be if I hadn't seen the joke twice already. As much as it pains me to admit it, that feature isn't enough for me to stay interested in the series.",

        "Content": "With The Beginner’s Guide, The Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden has delivered yet another fascinating musing on interactivity. This time, however, it’s a far more personal essay, and I was left thinking - for many, many hours afterward - not just about the process of game-making but about Wreden himself. In this regard, The Beginner’s Guide is an unforgettable experience.  The Beginner’s Guide opens in a charmingly illogical Counter-Strike map created by a developer named ‘Coda’. We are told this by Wreden himself, the emotive narrator of The Beginner’s Guide. Coda was a friend of his, he explains, who created many interesting games - not intended for public consumption - but has since stopped creating for reasons Wreden doesn’t understand. Wreden tells us he created The Beginner’s Guide in part as a message of encouragement for Coda to start creating again.  Wreden’s secondary intention is what got me hooked -  to take us through Coda’s body of work chronologically and thus reach a previously elusive conclusion about the man and his methods. What are the common elements in each of Coda’s games? Why did he make them during the time he made them? What was he trying to say? Can a video game offer insight into the mind of its creator?  It’s Wreden who makes moving through Coda’s body of work during The Beginner’s Guide’s 90 minutes the engaging experience that it is. Coda’s games are exploratory and deeply personal, demanding very little practical engagement from us, and more often than not are thematically obtuse. But Wreden’s lively commentary sheds light on their meaning, or at least, his interpretation of their meaning. He dances easily between topics - repeated motifs, for example, or possible themes - while littering the Beginner’s Guide with anecdotes of his relationship with Coda, like a self-deprecating story about his over-eagerness at getting to know the developer at a game jam. It’s a charming performance.  His presence encourages a great sense of fun while moving about Coda’s worlds, too. Like The Stanley Parable, much of my enjoyment in The Beginner’s Guide came from the narrator’s awareness of my actions and thoughts in my role as ‘the player’. Wreden’s commentary was always one step ahead of my own internal monologue: ‘Why is this wall here?’ I’d think. It just ends like that, says Wreden with a laugh. ‘Why is there a maze in a space station?’ Wreden doesn’t know either. The smashing of the fourth wall reaches its peak when Wreden actually dips into Coda’s games to add his own little flourishes in particularly janky or unplayable parts, or just to open them up and see how they tick. In one game, for example, he grants you the ability to make the oppressive walls of the level’s interior disappear, so you’re able to gaze at the world in its complex entirety. In another, he builds a bridge over an inhospitable area. As a player, it’s liberating to be allowed ‘behind the scenes’ in this way, but it also poses questions about whether or not Wredon should be doing this - by his admission, without Coda’s knowledge - in the first place.  The gut-punching conclusion to The Beginner’s Guide asks more questions than it answers, and  left me struggling with my own thoughts on Coda’s work, on Wreden’s intentions when he created The Beginner’s Guide, and that original hypothesis: can games offer windows into the minds of their creators? That I’ve not stopped thinking about it makes the question of fiction vs non-fiction in The Beginner’s Guide ultimately irrelevant.",

        "Subtitle": "Towering monsters steal the show in this action-MOBA.",
        "Subheader": "By Jason Fanelli Posted: Aug 30, 2017 9:32 pm",
        "Content": "Its huge monsters put on a great and imposing show, but Gigantic is really all about making its action-MOBA gameplay accessible. Its characters challenge, but they’re not ultra demanding. Its multi-phase battles require strategy and teamwork, but you don’t have to be a master tactician to succeed. It takes time to learn, but we’re talking weeks instead of months. The drawback is that its short, rapid-fire matches risk retreading the same ground a bit too often. There’s currently only one way to play Gigantic: a 5v5 battle where teams must gather energy to power the massive monsters that sit on either side of the arena. These Guardians are far more interesting than ordinary MOBA objectives because they’re active participants rather than stationary punching bags, and the few times they battle each other during a match are always exciting. Watching one swoop in from its perch, wrestle its rival to the ground, and expose the weak point for its team to attack is really cool, and I wished they’d spend more time in action instead of holding back.  Every battle plays out in two phases, each one fun in its own regard. First is the main phase, a fun but familiar mode in which teams gather power and battle each other over objectives. It follows more of a Counter-Strike or Battlefield’s Conquest format, rewarding for kills as well as territories controlled, rather than a typical MOBA where control is king. The action can get repetitive, but that balance of objectives makes the main phase of Gigantic enjoyable despite its familiarity. The constant back-and-forth of claiming these territories kept me on my toes as I watched the power meters rise. Rampage transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style. “ The second phase, Rampage, transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style of pushing toward the enemy’s side of the map, except that Gigantic’s original twist is to have one fully powered Guardian make its way across the map to attack and incapacitate its rival. The action becomes heated as every player makes a mad dash toward the two beasts, with one team focusing on the vulnerable Guardian while the other defends, unleashing all their abilities in a confined space. However, they only last a short period before reverting back to the main phase, and that brevity lessens the Rampages’ effectiveness. I also wish Rampages weren’t reserved for the same two spots on each map, as it’s odd seeing the struggles of powerful beasts like these happen in the same locations every time. After five Rampages without a victor comes the Clash, an endgame state which changes the battlefield to ensure matches don’t go on too long by opening new pathways and moving all objectives closer together. This creates more consistent action and quicker power-gathering. The Sanctum Falls arena during a Clash stands out for me, as it transforms from the largest map in Gigantic to the smallest in an instant. The action of Clash makes me wonder why it isn’t the default game mode, as it makes the main phase seem tame by comparison.  Gigantic throws an extra layer of strategy into the battle through tiny beings called Creatures with useful abilities that can be spawned from specific objective points. One might create a tree creature that heals nearby teammates, while another spawns a cyclops who builds walls to block paths; those extra powers give more importance to the decision of which points a team should concentrate on holding, depending on their strategy. These spawned helpers are also damage sponges, giving you plenty of time to come to their rescue. As the battle rages you can upgrade them to a more powerful form, making them even more important in battle and widening your options. If a healer isn’t available and I’m near death I know I can retreat to my creature and heal up. Only the Sanctum Falls map features something interesting. “ The arenas you fight in are bright and filled with color but otherwise aren’t exciting. The Ghost Reef is a canyon dotted with abandoned technology, while Siren’s Stand is an icy tundra sporting a few shipwrecks – you’d think those unique features would create a distinctive feel to gameplay, but they don’t actually do anything except serve as background decor and have no memorable interactivity. Only Sanctum Falls features something interesting, with underwater areas that slow you down and inflict damage while you’re underwater, but even they are easily avoided and sometimes completely ignored. Likewise, the roster of 19 heroes (of which a rotating selection are available to play for free, in the League of Legends model) checks all of the traditional MOBA boxes in a fairly generic way. There’s a tank in The Margrave, melee specialists like the bull Lord Knossos, the fast but weak assassin in Tripp, and long-range spell casters like the mage Mozu. Some designs are cool, with the potion-happy Uncle Sven and the dragon sorcerer Charnok being personal favorites, but otherwise very few of these warriors stand out on the selection page.  The heroes do become more interesting in battle, though, thanks to a leveling system that’s more in-depth than most MOBAs. Each hero levels up and gains new abilities throughout a match, but Gigantic gives more choice here than most in that each ability has two tiers of perks, and each tier has two branching choices. The robot HK-206’s Bullet Barrage, for example, offers either a higher rate of fire or armor-piercing rounds at Tier 1. At Tier 2, choices depend on what you chose first: If you picked high rate of fire, you can upgrade it with either more close-range damage or the ability to slow enemies with each hit. That’s a level of customization not seen in similar games (those without gear shops, at least), and experimentation is rewarding and reveals new roles for each of the 19 characters. Uncle Sven starts out as a standard healer, but by enhancing his Fire Flask with increased direct-hit damage and the ability to cause Burning damage over time you can make him an effective mid-range attacker as well. Being able to choose perks on the fly also allows you to adapt to the flow of each individual match, giving you an awesome power over your characters. Accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless. “ The problem with this perk system is the actual process of selecting each one. Accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless, so you can’t safely choose a new perk unless you’re waiting to respawn or you’ve retreated from action to find a quiet spot and sacrificed your momentum. The menu itself is irritating because it doesn’t always respond to button presses, which can make getting to my intended perk (and thus the period of vulnerability) take even longer. I fell victim to more than a few ambushes because of that, which isn’t great even if the upgrade system is impressive.  All of that nuance sounds intimidating, but Gigantic does a great job of teaching the ins and outs. The mandatory tutorial clearly and effectively lays the rules out, more so than others in my experience. Once that’s out of the way, the Practice Arena lets you tinker with each character to your heart’s content, or you can play as many bot matches as you wish before jumping into the real deal. Where other MOBAs are sometimes more keen to throw new players to the wolves, Gigantic makes a real effort to provide ample opportunity to learn it, making me feel more engaged in the process. Gigantic is a free-to-play game, so naturally in-game currency is a thing and can be purchased. However, the Fortune Card challenge system makes earning money for unlocking new characters and skins more fun than the standard grind. Each card you get comes with a challenge to complete, ranging from easy ones like inflicting X amount of damage on a Guardian to tougher character-specific challenges and straightforward ones like hitting a certain level with your account. Having those achievement-like objectives tied to in-game cash rewards makes earning more feel like less of a chore.",

But most importantly, you must always remember when it’s your turn to take the garbage out - something Hazelight Studios has certainly done during the development of the almost entirely garbage-free It Takes Two. This utterly superb co-op platformer manages to cram in enough unique and exhilarating gameplay ideas to give Shigeru Miyamoto a migraine, with not a single dud among them. Centering around a pair of pint-sized parents, May and Cody, It Takes Two is a bit like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids if the director had been tripping on LSD. The world around you isn’t merely supersized, but augmented with all manner of fabulous contraptions and anthropomorphic everything. May and Cody’s journey from their garden shed back to their house takes them on dazzling detours through everywhere from outer space to a tiny nightclub housed inside an air conditioning vent (attended by grooving hordes of anthropomorphic glow sticks, naturally), and serves as a sustained, 10-hour-long blast of co-op platforming bliss that’s constantly conjuring up new ways to engage and entertain. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask One moment Cody and May are collaboratively steering a giant pencil around a connect-the-dots picture, the next they’re casting spells and swinging swords as a wizard and barbarian in an isometric dungeon crawl. Before you know it they’ll be hopping along the tumbling crystalised interior of a kaleidoscope, and just when you think it must be out of ideas Cody will be piloting a tiny plane through the treetops while May squares off in a Street Fighter-style showdown with a member of the local squirrel militia on its wings. It just shifts seamlessly from one brilliantly bonkers style of gameplay to another, each with its own fresh set of mechanics, and almost none of it is ever recycled at any point. It Takes Two is like a box of donuts in your office breakroom: it arrives fresh, is gleefully devoured, and absolutely nothing included in it stays long enough to grow stale. “ Co-opportunities for Success Importantly, every action feels fantastic to perform. The platforming essentials are on point, with May and Cody’s jump, double-jump, and air-dash abilities being supremely responsive and allowing for effortless levels of platforming precision. But it’s the complimentary, character-specific abilities that are refreshed in each chapter that compelled me and my partner to work as a team and make It Takes Two a special style of platformer, turning seemingly simple ascents up the side of a cliff face into carefully choreographed back-and-forths and coordinated chants of “3-2-1-Go!” It Takes Two is like a box of donuts in your office breakroom: it arrives fresh, is gleefully devoured, and absolutely nothing included in it stays long enough to grow stale.Early on, Cody might have a bandolier of nails that he can throw into walls to plot a path of rungs for May to swing between with her claw hammer, while later May can use her water gun to soak fertile soil to allow Cody to plant himself and bloom into a winding flower with petals for platforms. These gizmos and abilities each deftly double as platform puzzle-solving tools and boss-fighting aids: May’s clone ability allows her to teleport from one weighted switch to another to trigger timed mechanisms, but it also enables her to lure a charging bull boss towards an obstacle before beaming herself out of harm’s way at the last second. The only catch to the split ability set is that there are occasionally moments where the enjoyment level is lopsided, where one character is pinballed around an area while the other can only watch, but it all evens out in the end and – if anything – it makes me want to replay it with swapped characters, just to see how the other half lived. It Takes Two also has the ability to effortlessly make mirth out of the mundane. In real life, my children’s fidget spinners seem like pointless trinkets, the forgotten remnants of a passing fad now cluttering up shelf space. In It Takes Two, they are whirring hoverboards that allow you to surf your way over giant inflatable slides, pulling spectacular midair tricks like a pair of tiny Tony Hawks. How do you prefer to play co-op games? Online On the same couch By myself with two controllers, one in each hand Answer See Results Additionally, while a lot of the elements in It Takes Two’s environments are there to serve a very clear gameplay purpose, a substantial amount of objects are interactive for no other reason than because they’re fun. The giant bass drum kick pedal plays no part in you reaching a level goal, but you can still buttstomp onto it and thump its hammer into a towering drum, because it’s fun. The carefully lined-up dominoes in the cardboard castle area might well be a static backdrop in any other game, but in It Takes Two you can topple them all over and knock a hapless small soldier into a bottomless pit, because it’s fun. It’s very much the Mario method of cramming as much magical interactivity into every square inch of each play space, and ensures that your every curious action goes rewarded. The fact that It Takes Two blesses you with infinite lives and extremely generous checkpointing, only makes you more emboldened to experiment. Book Who’s Talking The only real gripe that I can level at It Takes Two is aimed squarely at the character of Dr. Hakim. This walking and talking ‘Book of Love’ acts as a guide for May and Cody on their journey towards rekindling the love in their marriage, and he’s basically insufferably cringy right from his first appearance early on, and that doesn’t change in the numerous cutscenes he shows up in throughout. The only positive thing about him is that any time he does appear you know you’re about to be handed some natty new plaything or game-changing ability, so I never felt too sad to see him even if each and every one of his lines had me rolling my eyes rather than rolling with laughter. Dr Hakim’s appearances aside, I did enjoy It Takes Two’s story overall, especially in the way it neatly takes elements of May and Cody’s reconciliation efforts and weaves them into the gameplay. At one point the pair rediscover their attraction to each other by literally using two halves of the same magnet to puzzle their way through a level, for example. I was quite charmed by the way the two leads gradually learned to love each other again, even if the story’s final moments aimed for Pixar-style poignancy but came off as slightly saccharine. Of course, a lot of the marriage metaphors went over the head of my 10-year-old son who was partnering me on the adventure, and it made me wish for a game like this that was made more for a parent to share their love of gaming with a child as opposed to a couple playing together. Even so, it didn’t really impact the enjoyment we shared because so much of the contextual bickering and banter between the couple on screen was drowned out by our own laughing and shouting as an impromptu snowball fight broke out or we struggled to cooperatively draw a smiley face on a giant Etch-a-Sketch.",

        "Content": "We're told that The Blood and Wine expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt marks the last great ride of Geralt of Rivia, so far as developer CD Projekt Red is concerned. I like to think there are signs that this isn't the case, as much of its storyline revolves around the return of a friend long thought permanently lost. But even if it is, it's about as good as a sendoff as we could ask for. The sun may shine brighter here than it ever has for the Butcher of Blaviken, and there's a undercurrent of hope that's been lost in the flood of despair in previous entries, but fittingly enough, above all this is a tale of the pain of letting go. Most of the expansion's strength comes from the way it makes a clean break with the rest of The Witcher 3, shuttling us far from the corpse piles of Velen and the gray gloom of Skellige mere moments after accepting the relevant quest from a message board. The destination is Toussaint, a lovely place of rolling hills carpeted with vineyards and bathed in a warm light that seems to chase away the blues. It's a smart shift, as it avoids any guilt that Geralt should be busying himself with the bigger issues of the region (as was sometimes the case in Hearts of Stone). In sunny Toussaint, Geralt is just a famous witcher with no urgent need to save the world hanging over his head, and in the context of an expansion the tale is all the better for it. I admit I initially harbored some worries that it dabbled too much in buffoonery. Toussaint is modeled on the south of France, and barely an hour goes by before one of its brightly colored knights is yelling to a giant about how he'll chop him \"into a pâté.\" The story brims with gags at the expense of wine connoisseurship, right down to a sommelier who can sniff out the precise vintage of a specific wine based on a stain in seconds. The French chivalric tradition gets the skewer, too, and I rolled my eyes upon learning about a big to-do over a monogrammed handkerchief with the initials D.L.C. For a brief while I felt like telling you all not go to Toussaint – it is too silly a place for this grim and serious character to thrive. Duchess Anna Henrietta embodies the complexities of Toussaint itself. “ But I was love with the place within the first two hours of this roughly 20 to 25-hour adventure. It gives us another side of Geralt's world, and it shows that CD Projekt Red can still spin a good tale without leaning too heavily on doom and gloom. Even though Toussaint is only about the size of Velen's No Man's Land, going back to Novigrad and Skellige now feels like exile. It's not just the sight of its picturesque castle surrounded by snowcapped mountains that won me over, it's also the strong cast of characters. There's a quick-tempered shoe-shine boy who never fails to try to make a profit out of any conversation; there's Geralt's captivating, newly returned friend, whom I shall refrain from revealing; and there's a roguish young woman whose spite threatens to end the comparative happiness of Toussaint for good. But most of all I'm taken with the Duchess Anna Henrietta of Toussaint. She embodies the complexities of Toussaint itself, adorning herself in finery when at peace but fighting valiantly and confidently when the need arises. A little unexpectedly for this tale of sun and wine-swigging fun, this is chiefly a tale about vampires. It's generally handled well, even if the main antagonist is never so strongly depicted as the large cast of characters who surround him. He comes off as a petulant though powerful idiot, and his one true moment of complexity vanishes as swiftly as he does when shifting out of corporeal form. He mainly serves to give Geralt's returned friend more complexity. In fact, the vampire framework mainly serves as a backdrop for two good people struggling to justify their affection for their intractable friends and family and the consequences those relationships have for everyone else. Yet the lore is fascinating stuff. The tale takes us deep into Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski's strange and fascinating take on vampires, and it maintains momentum by introducing new twists whenever the story seems near a close. It's a brilliant celebration of the varied Witcher experience we've known until now, whether it's through the expected battles, the chumming about at masquerade balls, or Good Guy Geralt lifting age-old curses or even having a showdown with the Big Bad Wolf. Boss battles generally emphasize swiftness and careful strategic thought. “ As in Hearts of Stone, boss battles here generally emphasize swiftness and careful strategic thought, which again marks a welcome shift from the predictable brawls of the core game. (Eredin, I'm looking at you.) Among my favorite was a tournament battle with a huge rolling-rock creature that attempted to smash me in a small arena without any shelter, thus demanding several carefully timed dodges. The color that Blood and Wine brings to The Witcher 3 isn't just limited to landscape. Sometimes it's literal, as in the case of the cosmetic dyes Geralt can use on his Witcher sets (but, unfortunately, not on anything else). A small thing? Perhaps. But it means a lot to people like me who won't even wear an otherwise-good suit of armor if it looks like mismatched garbage. Dyes, too, allowed me to appreciate pieces I already loved in new ways. Take the Ursine armor; with a rich red dye splashed on it, I felt like I was some kind of inquisitor for Game of Thrones' R'hllor. Blood and Wine also introduces us to Geralt of Rivia, landed vintner, after he receives a dilapidated vineyard estate early on (and populated by peasants who seem completely unaware he's the boss). It's the kind of place I personally wouldn't mind retiring on, but it admittedly seems little out of character for Geralt of Rivia, monster slayer extraordinaire and rider of Roaches. I reconcile it by remembering that this expansion represents a retirement of sorts for Geralt. In practice, renovating it grants a great place to show off Geralt's armor and weapons rather than stashing them in a trunk, and a way of gaining some extra bonuses in exchange for gold. A bed, for instance grants Geralt vitality; a renovated stable gives Roach some more stamina. There's even a garden for growing herbs and an alchemy lab that can break down mutagens. That all makes for great reasons to come back and visit every once in awhile, but I do regret that there's virtually no choice involved aside from the decision to fork over some cash to have this or that building repaired. This is to say nothing of all the new weapons, armors, and goodies like a new Skellige gwent deck that round off the expansion, complete with grandmaster-crafted sets with set bonuses. Often these set bonuses even appear on the non-Witcher-specific sets you'll find, such as my personal favorite suit of vampiric heavy armor, which grants massive melee resistances and restores vitality for each enemy killed as long as I'm wearing at least three of its six pieces. The expansion also brings mutations which (finally) unlock new skill slots and grant side effect. “ The expansion also brings mutations which (finally) unlock new skill slots and grant side effects, such as one that boosts attack power and sign intensity in the first few seconds of a battle. These 12 mutations can greatly change the flavor of The Witcher 3's combat, whether it's by causing enemies to explode as you kill them with critical hits or granting a chance for a killing blow to cause Geralt to heal back to full health. All of this stuff might have trivialized the early story and battles, and thus mutations in particular are smartly aimed at giving New Game Plus players an edge as they venture into harder difficulties. As such, you can't even hold your own in the Blood and Wine content until around level 33, so the early game remains challenging. (If you want to skip all that and jump in with a fresh level-35 character, you can.) Still, a patch released alongside the expansion will bring improvements to the user interface for everyone, including a long-overdue option to read new books and letters the second you pick them up. I do wish we could have at least one more expansion, but Blood and Wine's additions help shore up some of the The Witcher 3's few weak points. It's a good way to leave Geralt. But that doesn't mean I won't miss him.",

        "Subheader": "By Scott Thompson Posted: Oct 23, 2013 4:00 pm",
        "Content": "I must admit to a level of skepticism when I began playing Wii Party U. Seeing as how it comes packaged with a Wii Remote Plus, I came in believing it would be on the level of a shallow minigame collection like Wii Play. To my surprise, Wii Party U has plenty to do, including a number of minigames and challenges that mostly use the GamePad and Wii Remotes in smart ways. Of course, like any good party, a group of friends is still a requirement for a good time.  Wii Party U is divided up in to four modes: TV Party, House Party, GamePad Party, and Minigames. TV Party plays a lot like the Mario Party series; you roll dice to move around a game board while battling in minigames. While two of the five boards follow a straightforward “get to the finish line first” objective, the other three inventively mix things up quite a bit.  One of my TV Party favorites is Mii Fashion Plaza, where you must collect items of clothing as your Mii moves around the board. As you pass the starting location, Judges award points based on the number of items worn and whether or not they are in the same style (astronaut, rock star, Mario, etc.). Winning minigames and landing on special spaces on the game board allows players to steal clothing from each other, either to complete an outfit or to prevent a foe from getting the most points possible. TV Party’s variants provide substantial changes to the experience, not simply a different backdrop, and that keeps the novelty going longer.  The Minigames mode takes the board game out of the equation altogether, and it actually has a good variety of ways to play in its tournaments, a single-player dojo with increasingly difficult AI, and a cooperative mode. Wii Party U manages to provide some flair for what could have been a fairly basic feature.  The minigames themselves fit comfortably between Mario Party 8’s excessive waggle obsession and Mario Party 9’s near abandonment of shaking the Wii Remote. In most cases, buttons are used where appropriate over waggling. When shaking is required, it is usually done in a clever way. One standout game involves winding two propellers in order to fly; instead of mindlessly waggling for 10 seconds, you must alternate between the left and right propellers in order to wind them nearly equally, otherwise the craft will simply veer off sideways. Call it waggling with care.  While mostly skill-based, there are a few minigames that rely entirely on luck. In these games, you make a choice and cross your fingers. It isn’t so bad with friends, as the odds at least feel somewhat even, but it’s hard not to get angry at the AI players when they fluctuate between picking the wrong choice every time and escaping without a scratch on a game-to-game basis.  House Party is a more casual and friendly affair that puts much less emphasis on competition. Three of the eight games are particularly fun, with the rest either being just okay or a waste of time. My friends and I especially enjoyed Name That Face, in which the GamePad displays an event (standing on the sun, about to sneeze) and has one player take a selfie making an appropriate face. The rest of the group then views the picture and must pick the right event out of four choices. It’s simple, with a bit of Wario-esque charm.  Still, House Party is mostly dominated by middling experiences. Dance With Me has everyone stand in a circle and hold Wii Remotes together, raising and lowering their hands in rhythm with songs from games like Tetris and Mario. That sounds alright on paper, but it isn’t really all that responsive or fun in practice. Feed Mii!, meanwhile, is especially bad, asking three people to shout out food items from a menu on the TV while the player with the GamePad inputs each order. It really isn’t worth playing more than once, and even that might be a stretch.  The final mode, GamePad Party, is designed for two players sitting with the GamePad between them. Some simple puzzle and sports games are available here, including my absolute favorite game in Wii Party U: Tabletop Baseball. In it, you and a friend take turns pitching and batting by pulling one of the GamePad’s sticks back and releasing it. It sounds simple, but there is some nuance with pitching, where the speed of the ball is directly affected by how far back the stick is pulled. My wife and I got into some heated matches, hurling fastballs and tossing change-ups as we tried to keep the other off balance as they’re swinging the bat. While the rest of GamePad Party is okay, I think Tabletop Baseball might become a nightly staple in my house for the foreseeable future.  I should stress that for as much as I enjoyed Wii Party U, most of it simply must be played with a group of four or more. TV Party with me, my wife, and two AI opponents really wasn’t anything spectacular, but it became so much better the next night when friends (and a few adult beverages) entered the fold. Small groups – and single players especially – will feel lonely at this party.",

        "Content": "zWhen I was young I used to watch wrestling all the time. Back when Hulk Hogan had his own cartoon, Cindy Lauper was involved, and Captain Lou Albano had rubber bands on his face. It was cartoony fun with larger than life characters. While everyone knows how fake wrestling is, it's still fun to catch once in a while on television. On your wireless device however, the fun ends quicker than a Batista championship run on Jeopardy.  Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 stars most of today's popular wrestlers. Everyone from John Cena to Tripe H to the Undertaker is ready to take on your challenge. You play as Default Wrestler ready to fight your way up the ladder until you face the Champion and try and win his belt. You have a choice between going for Raw or Smackdown's championship belt. While it's nice to be able to choose which brand you want to fight on, it really makes no difference since every wrestler in the game looks and acts exactly the same. This is all the more evident in the Customize mode, where you can create your own wrestler. You can change his face, boots, shirt style, etc. but in the end you have a wrestler with no name who ends up looking and performing like every wrestler in the game.  After choosing the brand you want to be on your quest for the gold begins. On Raw you fight Edge first making your way up to John Cena in a Hardcore Championship match. You can win by putting your opponent in submission holds, or by performing body slams and suplexes. If your opponent is on the ground, you can kick him or drop an elbow depending on your position. You can climb the turnbuckle and strike from above, or leave the ring and take the fight outside. Grappling is the most confusing out of the holds to master. Once you lock up, a bar appears with green, yellow and red sections. You have to try and keep the center line in the green area for three seconds to perform a body slam or suplex, but every time I tried it, it was hit and miss. Once your Momentum meter has filled, you can perform your finishing move and go for the pin. In between matches you can spend your points on upgrading your strength, grapple ability, durability, speed or charisma. I found the charisma upgrade to be quite funny since this is one game severely lacking in that department.  You can win matches one of two ways in this game. Perform body slams, try and win grapples and eventually beat your opponent with your awesome wrestling ability. Or you can do what I did. Stand right there and continually press the kick button until your opponent's health meter is depleted, you do your finisher, then pin him. I'm not kidding. It works against every wrestler I fought. I never even had to move to win a match until it was time to pin someone. I've reached a 41 hit combo by standing there as my opponent just kept walking into my kicks. I have had to retry matches on John Cena because for some reason after I depleted his health, he body slammed me twice and pinned me. You can try and get up from pins, but even if you've successfully gotten your shoulder up the wrestler still lays on top of you. Not exactly the most taxing A.I. in a video game.  The graphics aren't the most flattering either. Every wrestler looks like they belong in Lego Land. The music is forgettable and there are some weapons like chairs and trash cans lying around but there's no need to use them since the kick button magically works wonders. Sound effects are non existent and crowd noise is sporadic. After beating the entire Raw roster I unlocked the wrestlers I fought. Once I left the game and came back to it later I found those same wrestlers were locked again. Once I realized the game didn't save my progress half way through my Smackdown 'kick until they lose' run, I had no ambition to try and go for it again. ",

        "Content": "Life is Strange: True Colors has kept me more emotionally invested than any Life is Strange story since I played the original back in 2015. While every game in this adventure series is good in its own way, this one (from developer Deck Nine as opposed to the series’ creators at Dontnod) addresses many consistent issues that have plagued the last three games. It proves to be the best in the series thanks to consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling mystery story with good pacing, useful supernatural abilities, and perhaps most importantly, dialogue choices that offer more depth and complexity with big and most small decisions that actually impact the story in meaningful ways throughout the course of five chapters. While you can certainly play each chapter in bits and pieces, they’re all available immediately so you can binge its 14 hours of story in one sitting with no waiting. Every episode has good pacing, a clear goal, and plenty of suspense. Before writing this review, I played through True Colors multiple times and found no definitive way to experience the story. There’s a notable difference from previous episodes in that there is no recap of the previous chapter when starting a new one or a teaser for the next after completing one, but in its defense, True Colors does not really need it. Screens  -  Life is Strange: True Colors 13 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You play as Alex Chen, a young woman with a troubled childhood who comes to the fictional mining town of Haven Springs, Colorado to live with her brother Gabe. After a mysterious accident, Alex uses her supernatural empathic abilities to bring the town’s secrets to the surface. Personally, I wish that the trailers hadn’t spoiled the nature of the central mystery for me, so if you haven’t watched them yet, don’t – I urge you to go in blind. Haven Springs is stunning thanks to its scenic Colorado views. From the snowy mountains in the far background to the wooden bridge that separates the bus stop from the main street filled with colorful flowers and a river stream, this is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date and a compelling and effective tourism ad for Colorado. Haven Springs is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date “ This is a small mountain town, and in typical small-town fashion, everyone knows their neighbors and their community is tight-knit. It comes across loud and clear that the residents genuinely care about each other. Some of this insight comes from Alex’s phone, which shares details of her relationships with her friends with some text messages (the content of which varies depending on your in-game choices). Alex can also check out MyBlock, a Nextdoor-like social media platform where the townsfolk share local updates, Easter eggs, and local banter; some of which are pay-offs as a result of the choices Alex made around those characters. There’s even a moment in which the entire town partakes in a LARP to cheer up a grieving kid. Seeing the townsfolk dress up in costumes in areas like the town’s bar was by far my favorite moment of the entire story. There’s even a light RPG element in that particular chapter that helps make the entire section a lot more fun to engage in. The people of Haven Springs also have a lot of life to them, which made me feel more emotionally invested in the community. Previous Life is Strange games have struggled with consistently giving NPCs compelling backstories and many of them were failed by poor writing. Alyssa Anderson in the original Life is Strange, Evan Harris in Before the Storm , Hank Stamper in the first episode of Life is Strange 2 all had a lack of depth that made them come off as stereotypes. But in True Colors, I can’t name anybody who felt underserved. A lot of that comes from the excellent way in which you interact with them, which is enhanced by a supernatural phenomenon. Like Max Caufield in the original Life is Strange , Alex has an unexplained superpower: she can perceive strong emotions through colorful auras that outline people around her. It may not be as spectacular as turning back time, but it does go beyond just “reading” people: if a person’s feelings are strong enough, Alex will also begin to actually feel those emotions herself. It’s almost like an out-of-body experience where she walks a mile in their shoes. What's the best Life is Strange game to date? Life is Strange Life is Strange: Before the Storm The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit Life is Strange 2 Answer See Results In some cases, both scripted and unscripted, Alex can interact with items that contain memories (basically audio logs) that share a bit more about certain characters. I found this to be a nice add-on to Alex’s already robust empathic powers; not only can it help with dialogue choices big and small, it helps to add more perspective to Haven Springs’ residents. In one instance after exploring the flower shop, I found a t-shirt memory that explained how Riley Lethe met her on-and-off-again boyfriend Mac Louden at a bot-fighting competition she participated in. And if you decide to go off the beaten path, you will be rewarded with an additional backstory for certain characters that Alex will write in her journal. Her journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character you’re playing as – sometimes she will write new lyrics or share extensive detail on when she engages in another’s strong emotions; you can even playback the optional memories you find. One of my favorite aspects of Deck Nine’s handling of Life is Strange’s story-driven format is that, unlike previous games in this series, there are so many choices – regardless of size – that impact Alex’s journey and future. One example of True Colors maintains throughout the story involves a side plot with Eleanor Lethe who early on in the game you find out she is having health issues, in particular, she is suffering from memory loss. But no one in town, not even Riley, who sees Eleanor is a material figure knows of her illness. At one point late in the story just as Riley is about to leave for college, you can tell her about Eleanor’s condition, but having previous conversations with both will leave you with the choice of whether to be honest and tell Riley the truth and risk violating Eleanor’s trust or keep the secret and allow Riley to go away to school. Those consequences and reactions feel real and consistent thanks to the detailed facial animations and appropriate body language of NPCs. Sure, some of those reactions are emphasized and spelled out when an aura appears, but even without the aura I always had a good understanding of how a character was feeling after Alex interacted with them. Alex's journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character “ Because of the increased emphasis on the consequences of our actions, there were many times when I made a choice and had to second-guess whether that was what I wanted to do. No other Life is Strange game has made me reload a checkpoint save just to see a cutscene play out differently. There were times in previous games when I felt the writers would have dialogue options, you could have multiple options for a dialogue choice that is consistent with the overall protagonist, but another option felt “forced” or out of place. But Deck Nine’s superb writing offers multiple dialogue options that all feel like something Alex would say and remain consistent with her personality. By the time you get to Chapter 5, the effects of most of the choices you’ve made will play out in one way or another. It was a lovely surprise to see just how many decisions I made in earlier episodes metamorphosed into my own personal-feeling version of Chapter 5. Life is Strange has always been a series with high replayability, but this level of detail and variation in scenes makes True Colors even more rewarding for me to replay again and again. Like the previous installments, Life is Strange: True Colors has multiple endings that can result from the choices you make, none of which is a canonically “true ending.” While I initially thought I had a good idea of how the story would go, Deck Nine managed to keep me guessing – and by the time the plot twist came I was left in disbelief, eager to see how the final parts would play out. Yet each ending – and their variations – all felt natural to Alex, and she remained true to the character of someone who is happy and hopeful for the future that lay ahead. I also loved that even when Alex solves the main mystery, there are still plenty of secrets for her to discover around Haven Springs. The seeds of these side stories are planted through clever foreshadowing and hints for the curious among us, and their revelations always felt rewarding to me. There are even optional stories that happen in each episode where Alex can use her abilities to help people, such as helping a man guess how many jelly beans are in a jar so he can win the $100 gift card to take his mom out to a nice meal, boosting a runner’s self-esteem, or helping pair up a couple of friends with a mutual attraction to one another but were too scared to make a move. Even among the core cast of characters, in my first few playthroughs, there was always something new I could learn about them that allowed me the opportunity to form a better bond with them. Here's what we thought of the final episode of Life is Strange: Life Is Strange — Episode 5: Polarized is a fascinating exploration of a teenager deeply affected by loss, trauma, suffering, and failure. This is not the coming-of-age story Life Is Strange pretended to be early on, though. Polarized is destructive, unquestionably the bleak climax of the murder mystery that’s been dormant during most episodes, and it only somewhat works by the time Max Caulfield arrives to her ending. It’s disappointing to see Life Is Strange lean into its angrier story threads to complete its otherwise-touching human story, but its emotional closure and character resolutions make this a more memorable ending than its unnecessarily dark plot twists. - Mitch Dyer, October 21, 2015 Score: 6.5 Read the Life is Strange Episode 5: Polarized Review Deck Nine also far outshines Dontnod in the romance department, with two strong options that Alex can pursue in Ryan and Steph. In previous Life is Strange games, especially Dontnod’s (Life is Strange 1 & 2), you had the option to romance either a male or female character and choose the protagonist’s sexuality, but I found those games to have lackluster options. Yes, that decision is a small piece of a much larger puzzle, but when I look back at them, Dontod’s poor writing always offered a strong bias towards one potential partner over the other. By comparison, Deck Nine offers an equal playing field to both Ryan and Steph, and when I played the first four chapters for the first time I was unsure who I wanted Alex to be with – or whether to choose one of them at all since you’re given the ability to opt-out of romance altogether. Both characters have their pros and cons and it’s quite clear Deck Nine is placing the ball in your court, and neither feels like they are getting the short end of the stick.",

Turning and maintaining that twitch control is a burden when the screen is crowded with ramps, fun boxes, and half-pipes. And being on a bike instead of a slim skateboard, that trouble is doubled in BMX games. There's no compensation for the controls, so bikers will get stuck in corners or turn too sharp for ramps and stack on themselves. Sometimes the control tries to be automatic, such as popping up stairs, but then its handling of transition ramps and leaps just bomb out instead of taking over for the player. And overall, the game is too simple in controls -- only 9 stunts plus a bunny hop, and no grinds or flatland stunts. Getting air is fun, but that's not all there is to BMX. In attempts to go quantity over quality, the developers added three types of gameplay -- street, vert, and dirt. The variety in the tracks isn't much, especially since there are no specialized street tricks or grinds to beef up the street and vert tracks, and the dirt courses are all the same two basic ramps that don't allow much room to mix up the stunts. They would have been better off with a Big Air competition like in the X-Games, with only three ramps and much more speed on your side to prove yourself. The game's engine unfortunately doesn't have the power to really mix it up in the street courses, with only a few platforms and ramps, and oddly, even little ramps have the potential to pop riders off with as much height as a full half-pipe. And the game's final proving ground is simply a really long half-pipe with no transitional gaps or trick bumps -- it simply takes longer to ride the flat part of the ramp. How weak. The real trouble here, however, is in the handling of the trick system and point scale. The game is loaded with huge \"Money Moves\" that, like Madden's \"Money Plays,\" always work and yield gigantic gains. Between the programmers and the art staff, there seems to have been no collaboration, because some of the biggest scoring moves, like the Front Flip and No Hander, also have the shortest animations. Perhaps the point values are supposed to be based on the difficulty of doing the trick in real life (it sort of makes sense -- a Back Flip is worth less than a Front Flip), but in the game, it's just a matter of tapping a button and a direction, and since there's no penalty in the animation, the easiest moves to land are worth mega-points. It's like if a Kick Flip were worth as much as a 900 in Tony Hawk . These Money Moves could have been lessened if the game was balanced, but against all reason, there's no penalty for staying with one trick over and over. Tony Hawk penalized a stale routine harshly, but in T.J. Lavin , you can pull off Superman grabs until the crowd grows beards, and you'll still be the judge's fave. So instead of the challenge being a test of how cleanly and how mixed you can turn in a technical run, the purpose of playing this game is simply trying to rack up as many No Handers as you can in a single swing. Also foolishly missing is any bonus for holding a grab or plant move. Just pop as quick as possible and go for another move right afterwards. The developers didn't even add bonus points for a combo -- except for the tough 540, none of the stunts award bonus points for training tricks together. And though it's a feather in your cap for landing a 1260, the point value isn't nearly worth 9 No Handers, so why bother? This lack of attention to detail unfortunately shakes out in the graphics as well. Although the basic graphics are sharp and animated smoothly, when it comes to the gameplay, the visuals do some funny things that make it look faked. Some stunts are rushed, such as the flips that seemingly defy gravity when the rider suddenly stops in mid-air and twists fully before the bike begins to fall to the ground again. Often, the rider comes down with his front wheel tipped 45 degrees wrong, but he'll still land the trick. Stunts can only be performed once a bike has flipped and is working its way down, so half the hangtime is wasted because there isn't enough animation to go across the entire jump. There also aren't many tricks in the book, and one -- the Superman Seat Grab -- is repeated with the same animation and just a different name slapped on [standard Seat Grab].",

        "Subtitle": "Is this DLC worthy of Beatrice's smokin' body?",
        "Subheader": "By Greg Miller Updated: May 9, 2012 8:04 am Posted: Mar 5, 2010 11:07 pm",
        "Content": "When I finished Dante's Inferno , I felt something that game endings rarely leave me with these days – satisfaction. I had made my way through the circles of hell, had a conclusive end to the Dante/Beatrice relationship, and had a vaguely happy ending to reminisce about as the inevitable sequel gets worked on. Everything was right with the world Visceral Games and EA had created.  Now, the Dark Forest downloadable content is here with a new Disco Inferno Dante costume, a new relic for your main quest, two new enemies, and a new level. Frankly, I don't need it. It's not that the Dark Forest level is bad; it just doesn't fit into the space the developers are trying to put it.  This is a prequel to the game that picks up after the opening cutscene in Dante's Inferno where our hero has just finished sewing that awesome cross into his chest. There's no new cutscene to introduce this, it just starts with Dante at the fire and the new enemy known as the forest siren popping up to start some crap. This woman – a bit overweight and dressed in a white outfit with some black stuff on it – looks a lot like the Witch from Left 4 Dead and moans all sensually before running her hands over her body.  Daddy like.   Disco never died in our video. When she attacks, the forest siren will slash at you with large fingernails; sometimes she'll bewitch you and you'll have to tap a button to break the spell; and other times she'll fire off a purple sphere to knock you down and whoop your health bar. Eventually, you'll beat her and a few other versions of her before moving on to the next area where you'll need to take on the next new enemy – a massive soldier type – and begin navigating a puzzle where you need to take the moonlight into account.  All of this is ok, but it doesn't feel like the main portion of Dante's Inferno. When you absolve/punish an enemy here, you don't get health or magic orbs. If you want to refill those meters, you need to break the few fountains that are scattered about. This makes for a tougher time playing the level, but it also makes it feel like this isn't the same game – like this is a challenge room and not a prequel to the story. Similarly, your holy and unholy meters are already maxed out so you can't load your previous save and continue building up your Dante. This is done so that everyone's starting from the same point, but as someone who just needs to polish off the holy side of things to finish his Dante, it's a bit sad. It's also annoying that my phantom cross attack gets blocked by stuff in the level; those flying things are invulnerable to my Christian-themed attacks once they drop back into certain doorways.  I think if this was just pitched as a standalone challenge mode, I wouldn't be as let down with it, but I really dug the story Dante's Inferno told. Dropping in this level doesn't fit – Dante already has the Grim Reaper's scythe, Beatrice shows up as a ghost even though Dante doesn't know she's dead, and the guy whose \"sister\" Dante made a deal with pops up and says a line he says towards the end of the original game that basically gives away one of the title's cool twists.  Also, Beatrice's nipples are missing.  You're messing with the best, son. ",

        "Subtitle": "Polished, personality-driven and free-to-play.",
        "Subheader": "By Cam Shea Posted: Jul 17, 2013 10:38 am",
        "Content": "In the pantheon of epic showdowns, plants versus zombies would have to be somewhere between rocks versus rainbows and Labradors versus raptors (also known as Tokyo Jungle ). That’s the point, of course; it’s a deliberately daft concept, driven entirely by the charm of its presentation and the robustness of its gameplay.  For the long-awaited sequel, PopCap hasn’t reinvented the gameplay wheel, instead opting to expand upon the original’s tried-and-true mechanics, while moving to a free-to-play pricing structure. Gamers wary of sequelitis and aggressive in-game monetisation need not fear, however - the gameplay changes are thoughtful and a great deal of fun, while PvZ2 offers up an enormous amount of content for free. You can get to every single level without spending a cent, with only a handful of optional plants and perks locked behind a paywall .  If you’ve played Plants vs. Zombies before then you know the basics of the sequel: grow plants to defend against the waves of zombies jonesing for your sweet, sweet brain. Many of the classic plants return, as does Crazy Dave – alongside some kind of sentient food truck – but instead of fighting around the house you’re taken on a trip through time and space. It’s a safe change. The new themes – Ancient Egypt, the Wild West and the Pirate Seas – are nothing if not archetypal. Thankfully, they’re executed with the bubbly personality the series is famous for, and each setting introduces its own twists on the core mechanics.  In Pirate Seas levels, for instance, zombie pirates attempt to board your ship. The number of full lanes is often cut right back, with murky depths lurking to either side of the gangplanks. You may have less room to plant, but you can also use the Spring Bean to bounce zombies into the nearby water, which can be a hugely rewarding one-hit-kill tactic. These seas are certainly heaving.  The Wild West, meanwhile, introduces railroad tracks. These also reduce the amount of space you have to work with, but being able to plant atop the mobile mine carts that can shift lanes on the fly opens up a host of new possibilities, and PopCap's design very much takes advantage of them.  The zombie bestiary changes with each world too, and – as you’d expect – many of the designs are adorably goofy. In the Wild West alone you’ll face grizzled prospectors propelled deep into your garden by dynamite, battle pianists that summon dancing cowboys, and fight a dude with a flock of chickens strapped to his body. Why? Who knows! But they leave a lasting impression.  Plants vs. Zombies 2's new plants are great fun to experiment with, too. Take Bonk Choy; this fist-fighter has a limited range but packs a wallop, and can still be devastatingly effective from behind a defensive Wall-nut. Lightning Reed is fun too – this plant fires electricity down its lane and adjacent lanes, and the lightning strikes chain between zombies. It’s a low-damage attack against one enemy, but can be quite effective against crowds. Riding the lightning... less rock'n'roll than it sounds.  The new arsenal is greatly enhanced by the introduction of Plant Food; useful plant steroid collected during levels which can be banked until you want to use it. Then, when the moment is right and the zombies are closing in, you drag it onto any plant to trigger a unique super attack. A standard Peashooter, for instance, unleashes a concentrated burst of peas down one lane, while the Melon-pult lobs a volley of watermelons all over the screen, and the Bloomerang sends boomerangs flying horizontally and vertically. It’s a solid inclusion that adds another layer of tactics – you’ll need to consider each unit’s Plant Food ability at the selection screen, as these supers can be the difference between victory and defeat when used effectively.  As in the original, there’s no right way or wrong way to play, allowing a rewarding sense of freedom in your zombie-killing strategy. Maybe you like to plant offensive units as early as you can, building your arsenal slowly but steadily, or perhaps you prefer to get your sun economy humming as quickly as possible, using stalling tactics during the first few waves for a bigger pay-off later. Maybe your strategy is built around multi-lane attackers, or maybe you’re into high-impact, single-lane strike forces.  Of course, you’ll have to adjust your tactics depending on the zombies in each level and the rules in play, meaning that while you’ll have favourites, you’ll wind up using a fair slice of the available arsenal over the course of the campaign. You should use them all too, if for no other reason than to see the animations. Zombies and plants alike are crisply drawn and brimming with personality, and you can really see the love that’s been poured into every frame. The train tracks in the Wild West are designed to be a mixed blessing.  I appreciate the way PvZ2 mixes up the gameplay as well. There’s a heap of ways levels are shaped to create a new challenge – some have a standalone design, such as making you match symbols to kill zombies or plan your defensive formation in full before the enemies start rolling in. Others simply tweak the rules a little, limiting you to a specific set of plants, a certain amount of sun, having no more than a certain number of plants active at one time, getting through a level without losing more than X number of plants, or defeating a certain number of zombies within a set period of time. Most levels will throw a few stipulations at you simultaneously, creating some nicely challenging combinations.  While there’s a fair bit of variety on offer here, it certainly doesn’t match where the original game is at right now, with all its mini-games and additional modes. Also note the absence of night levels, as well as fog. That’s fine though – Plants vs. Zombies 2 is doing its own time-travel thing, and PopCap has said that new worlds and content will be released on an ongoing basis. Fingers crossed for a distant future setting. Robot zombies anyone?!  Besides, it’s not like you’re short on content out of the gate. There’s a huge amount of gameplay here – I’m talking 50-odd challenges in each world and dozens of hours of play. You don’t need the perks and plants behind the paywall , but if you want to spend a couple of bucks to get the Snow Pea, you can. Hell, if you want to pay to open up every world and every level right from the start you can do that too. It’s up to you, but I personally got an enormous amount of enjoyment out of Plants vs. Zombies 2 for next to nothing. There's one unnecessary and unfortunate byproduct of the switch to free-to-play, however, in the Power Up attacks. These cost in-game coins to use (which can be earned at a slow but fair rate or bought for real money) and offer up three new means for dispatching enemies: frying them to a crisp, popping their heads off, and flinging them off the screen. Each is wildly overpowered and essentially lets you buy your way to victory. I don’t want a “get out of jail free” option – I want to win because I’m a badass gardener. Thankfully, I found I could completely ignore the Power Ups, and cutting them out of the picture left an excellent challenge that ramps up smoothly.",

        "Subheader": "By Matthew Adler Updated: Jun 1, 2022 12:56 am",
        "Content": "For retro enthusiasts, finding legitimate modern ways to experience games from 40 or more years ago can be a daunting task. Sure, most of the popular ones have been repackaged and released in various collections or mini consoles throughout the years, but what about some of the more obscure titles that nobody seems to remember? Evercade Handheld 15 Images Blaze Entertainment heard those pleas, and while its Evercade platform offers a vast library of titles spanning decades of arcade and home consoles to collect and play, the handheld itself leaves much to be desired. Evercade Handheld – Design and Features Right off the bat, the Evercade has a distinct retro aesthetic that’s oozing with ‘70s and ‘80s vibes. It features an off-white exterior with striking red trim and grey accents. The face has a glass-like plastic finish and it’s all tied together with smooth, rounded edges. It includes four face buttons as well as start and select on the right side of the screen with a rocker-style D-pad and menu button on the opposite side. All the buttons feel great to press with the D-pad specifically “designed to feel like classic consoles.” On the top of the handheld are two very low-profile shoulder buttons that unfortunately depress way too easily – I would constantly find myself pressing them and hearing the audible “click” while just holding the device naturally. Thankfully, most of the arcade-era games don’t utilize these buttons, but for the games that do it led to some frustration and required me to rest my index fingers behind the shoulder buttons so as not to accidentally press either one. Even worse, the right shoulder button frequently got stuck, which is a bit concerning right out of the box. There’s also a power toggle switch and a micro HDMI output for connecting the device to your television and using the Evercade Handheld as a controller, although this less-common cable is not included in the box. On the rear, there’s a large open slot for the Evercade cartridges, which become flush with the unit once inserted, making for an inconspicuous, seamless look. Across the bottom are two volume buttons, a headphone jack for connecting a pair of wired headphones, and a micro USB port for recharging the internal battery. You can expect to get roughly four hours of battery life on a single charge, and during my testing I found this to be accurate. One nice feature to prolong the device’s battery is that the display will automatically turn off after about 30 seconds of inactivity, only to instantly wake when any button is pressed. Speaking of the display, the Evercade Handheld features a 4.5-inch widescreen with a 480 x 272 resolution. That said, since most of the games use a traditional 4:3 aspect ratio, the widescreen feels a bit wasted outside of the system menus. Resolution aside, the display is very low-quality with terrible viewing angles. Looking at it straight on is fine, but the slightest tilt causes the display to become noticeably darker. Tilting it down roughly 45-degrees causes the colors to become completely inverted, something I haven’t seen in a handheld device since what feels like the ‘90s. For a sub-$100 handheld device it’s clearly not going to compete with the likes of the Nintendo Switch or even modern smartphones, but this screen technology still feels completely outdated in 2021. Evercade Handheld – Software Evercade features a library of retro and arcade collections housed on proprietary cartridges that can only be played on the Evercade Handheld or the upcoming Evercade VS home console. These carts are roughly the width of a GameBoy cartridge, but about two-thirds the height with a rounded edge that sits flush with the handheld when inserted. Each cartridge features a small collection of games, some with just a couple, some more than a dozen. Most game collections are grouped by publishers such as Atari, Namco, and Data East, just to name a few. Currently, there are 26 collections containing more than 280 games spanning arcade games as well as various home consoles. In other words, you can expect roughly 11 games per cartridge, on average. With each cartridge costing 15 pounds (or roughly $21 USD) it’s a decent value and for many of the games, the only way to play them on a “modern” console. While many of the usual suspects are present, such as Pac-Man, Galaga, Asteroids, and Double Dragon, far too many of the games are filler titles and likely won’t see much play time. Furthermore, many of the popular titles are split across different collections, requiring you to buy multiple cartridges if you want to play a handful of favorites. (Seriously, how did Mappy Kids make it into Namco Museum Collection 1 over Galaga?) Regardless, Evercade is clearly marketed towards collectors and retro enthusiasts, and the neat little numbered cases would look great on a shelf. It’s hard enough to collect retro games as it is, so having a company dedicated to packaging them for you is a nice bonus. Evercade Handheld – Gaming After inserting your desired cartridge, you’ll browse through the menu that includes each game’s box art, screenshot, year of release, and genre. You can also change the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9, if you prefer, as well as adjust brightness and change between six different languages. The only thing missing from the main menu section are the controls for each individual game. Instead, this information is contained within a booklet inside each collection’s case, along with screenshots and tips for each game. The Evercade Premium Pack includes three game collections: Atari Collection 1, which features 20 games such as Centipede, Asteroids, Missile Command, and more; Namco Museum Collection 1 – 11 games such as Pac-Man, Galaxian, and Dig Dug; and the Interplay Collection 1, which has six games including Earthworm Jim and Clay Fighter. Gameplay was smooth for each of the games I played across the three included collections, and bouncing between games couldn’t be easier. What’s nice is each game features six save states that can be accessed at any moment, allowing you to easily pause and return to a game you were in the middle of without being forced to completely restart. This is a welcome feature for many of the arcade games that don’t have built-in game saves. The rocker-style D-pad feels very similar to that of the Sega Genesis’ controller. It’s incredibly easy to press in any direction and can easily be rotated in a circle. While this is great for some of the platformers and fighting games, I often found I was making mistakes in the traditional arcade games that require more precise directional input, specifically when sliding my finger across the D-pad to quickly change directions as they didn’t register. Other than this small issue that can easily be remedied by pressing each input instead of sliding over to it, the D-pad and face buttons feel responsive. Purchasing Guide Since the Evercade Handheld is manufactured in the UK, it’s primarily sold through UK retailers such as Amazon UK or GAME for a suggested retail price of 59 pounds (or roughly $85 USD) not including international shipping. It can also be found at US retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for $99, although the collection includes the Data East Collection 1 in place of the Namco Museum Collection 1.",

        "Content": "I swear, Griptonite Games , I don't have a personal vendetta against you or anything. By some weird stroke of fate, both the DS games I've reviewed this year have happened to be your games, and I hate that they're both rather overwhelmingly negative, but it's  nothing personal, I promise. That said, how is it that you guys keep getting stuck with quick-n-dirty licensed game ports? It's obvious that you've got plenty of talent, yet Activision seems fit to put you on Big Screen Action/Kids Flick: The Game when you can clearly make an awesome little DS outing if given enough time and resources.  Obviously neither of those were at your disposal, or if they were, they were squandered, because just as Monsters vs. Aliens was a rather short, repetitive attempt to rake in some cash along with the big-screen debut, X-Men Origins takes a promising concept and runs it into the grounds while upping the difficulty to incredibly frustrating levels and just calls it a day. It sports almost nothing in the way of a worthwhile storyline to link the five agonizingly long levels, and little \"extras\" like voice acting that were seen in your previous game aren't even here, further making it feel like this was a rote Summer Action Flick: The Game of the Movie.  When it all started out, I was actually pretty excited. The game's Spider-Man: Web of Shadows roots (at least in the engine itself) were readily apparent, and the moves list quickly grew as I sought out little wisps of scent to find unlockables. I thought the process of hanging out around the streaks of gassy color until the bottom screen had an X-Men symbol slooooowly aligning would get more complicated or fun, but it was literally just waiting until the symbol fully formed and then tapping it. Fair enough, though, the combat did seemed interesting, what with being able to juggle enemies, uppercut them into the air to dish out more hurt, rocking a fast/strong series of attacks and even a little dash button.     I quickly found, however, that most of these moves didn't amount to anything but a severe beating when four or five enemies, some of which were shielded, others that had to be knocked down with specific attacks, were on the screen. If I could just get in enough hits to build up my Rage Meter, I could leap out of the fray and then scratch all over the touch screen to hit everyone, which was fun, but almost without fail, another , stronger wave of enemies would come running out. That's not fun, it's frustrating, and it only got worse when I inevitably died and had to endure a lagging checkpoint run back through the same areas.  Maybe it was assumed that because it's Wolverine , and he can heal himself, that tons of cheap enemies that will attack from off-screen or hit you when you're down or juggle you with unblockable attacks would be okay. Thing is, Wolverine doesn't regenerate nearly fast enough, so battles can take his health from full to nil in just a few seconds, and even all the perfectly-timed blocks in the world can't stave off the inevitably trip through the last checkpoint area. It got so I'd just try to sprint through any areas I could until they'd get walled off and I'd have to fight my way out with spazzy little jumping strikes and playing keep-away on the walls.  What's worse is that the combat can be fun when enemies are dogpiling on top of Claws McGee; there's quite a bit of depth to the moveset, and finding and unlocking new movies is, if nothing else, a nicely involved process. But almost none of those moves are used because they just lead to getting pounded from all sides. I just resorted to using jumping hard attack strikes over and over again because it was the only thing that would stun enemies long enough to get my health back up.  Right from the beginning, too, the game showed some nice comic roots. They got Weapon X's escape from his facility (now Alkali Lake according to the big screen mythos), giant helmet 'n all. The characters all sport a kind of exaggerated, cartoony look that feels rather Joe Madueria-esque, and it fits the look of the game, right down to the smoothness of the animations. The problem is, you'll end up spending so much time running through the same areas, doubling back or running through an upper level that they lose some of their punch. The first time I saw a piece of paper flitting down from above during the prison break level, I thought it was cute. The third, fourth and fifth times? Not so much.  The audio isn't quite as entertaining. There's no real voice work, and while the sound effects are solid (everybody needs a good \"SNIKT\" in their lives), the music tends to just sort of done while you mash buttons. Where's a gravelly-voiced Wolvie adding some punch to him calling everyone \"bub?\" It just didn't have the kind of aural oomph I was hoping for.",

        "Content": "It's gotten to the point where many WiiWare offerings are worse than games you can play for free online. HB Arcade Cards is a no-frills collection of common card games that doesn't provide any incentive to put down an actual deck of cards and pick up your remote.  There isn't even any multiplayer option, so all you can do is play old timey amusements against the computer.  That means HB Arcade Cards is actually less functional than a deck of cards.  And it costs about five times as much.  Six games are included in this download: solitaire, canasta, euchre, cribbage, rummy, and hearts.  But all you really need to play these games is a $1 deck of cards, not the $255 it costs to buy a Wii and download HB Arcade Cards.  This videogame version of all your grandma's favorites would have been useful if it allowed you to play with faraway friends online, but it hasn't been able to figure out the technology of 1996.   Check out this video of HB Arcade Cards.   I'm not a grandmother, so some of these games were unfamiliar to me.  HB Arcade Cards doesn't do a great job of teaching us the rules, though.  You can scroll through a bunch of text that details how to play each game, but it misses the opportunity for an interactive tutorial.  There are no options or extra features to speak of.  A single five-second tune loops forever and ever on the title screen and during tutorials, but an actual game has no soundtrack at all.  Virtually no effort was put into HB Arcade Cards' presentation.  The interface is just about the only thing this game gets right, and even it is unremarkable.  Your remote's pointer functionality works well enough for selecting and moving cards around the playing area.",

        "Subheader": "By Colin Moriarty Posted: Apr 30, 2013 7:00 am",
        "Content": "PlayStation Vita may be capable of console-quality gaming, but its largely untapped strength rests in its potential to provide those experiences in commute-friendly, time-sensitive bursts. Soul Sacrifice straddles the line between delivering the depth typically found on console and the on-off-on-again routine of handheld gaming, and the result is something that will likely please Vita owners hungry for a quality, grind-heavy RPG. Delivered by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, Soul Sacrifice suffers from problems endemic to likeminded games in the genre – think Monster Hunter or Phantasy Star Online – but it also does some unique things that help keep it fresh. While it can occasionally bog down in sheer repetition and the rampant overuse of monsters and maps, there’s something inherently and undeniably addicting about Soul Sacrifice. Its charm rests, at first, in its presentation and story. Soul Sacrifice tells the tale of an imprisoned mage – your character – who is accompanied in his miserable cell by a strange-looking book. This isn’t some dusty old tome, but a living, breathing entity named Librom, and through Librom, your character will relive apocalyptic events from the past, giving you the skills, information and gusto necessary to escape from your current predicament. The story is delivered via voice-acted text with few frills to be found – actual cutscenes are exceptionally rare in Soul Sacrifice – and the plot pretty much never stops winding. Virtually every mission, whether on your primary quest or through a slew of side quest paths, is given context in the storyline. The plot can get a little confusing, made all the more muddled by the sheer number of characters you’ll encounter on your journey, but regardless, the fact that there’s a story worth reading at all is a step in the right direction in a sub-genre of RPG that emphasizes grinding, customization, and a whole lot of battling over any sort of meaningful exposition. I found myself skipping the story as I got deeper into the game, not necessarily because it wasn’t interesting, but because I was eager to get back into the fray. Librom’s voice-acting is expertly delivered, and exploring his many pages is done easily via the Vita’s touch screen. Each and every mission is embedded on Librom’s digital parchment, along with an insane amount of “lore,” touching on enemies, locations, and more. When you’re not in battle in Soul Sacrifice, you’re invariably reading Librom, and developer Comcept has done an amazing job of making this unusual menu scheme work. It would be easy to feel confined by such a system, but Librom’s sheets are vast and easy to navigate, and paging through with regularity is integral to your success. When you get out of Librom and onto the field of battle, however, Soul Sacrifice becomes a little more of a typical third-person action RPG. Combat lacks any sort of verticality here, however. In other words: you can’t jump, making fights feel a bit more stringent and a little less arcadey than similar games like Ragnarok Odyssey. Once I got used to the way Soul Sacrifice feels, however, it was easy to get pulled into its satisfying scoring and loot systems as I delved deeper and deeper into Librom’s story. Players can fight with Offerings they earn after each battle, rummaging through and organizing them to create various permutations that will best fit the desired play-style. For instance, in your six available Offering slots, you’ll likely want to have some curative moves, perhaps a missile-based attack, and some melee strikes that take advantage of different enemies’ weaknesses. There’s considerable depth here, whether you’re looking to get up close and personal with the monsters you fight, keep a safe distance and launch spells from afar, or just about anything in between. Offerings can be upgraded and combined, too, opening up yet another door through which you can easily get lost in customizing bliss. The actual act of fighting with these Offerings is also quite enjoyable, although action is occasionally held back by a sometimes-wonky lock-on system. If you’re fighting multiple enemies, you may have a difficult time locking onto the enemy you actually want to go after, and the camera will bug out if you’re stuck in a corner with an enemy breathing down your neck. But these problems aren’t encountered often enough that they ruin the experience. Indeed, Soul Sacrifice plays very well, with a combination of Vita’s dual analog sticks, face buttons, triggers and only the rare use of the touch screen combining to make for an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use control scheme. You may tire of fighting the same enemies over and over again, but Soul Sacrifice does enough right to make such a complaint nothing more than an aside. At the crux of Soul Sacrifice’s combat system – its namesake, in fact – is your character’s ability to manipulate the souls of those around him. This adds an extra dynamic to Soul Sacrifice that sets it apart from its more trite and boring contemporaries. In short, when an enemy is defeated, you can opt to assimilate his or her soul for the gain of extra life power or extra magic power. Sometimes, one comes to the detriment of the other, forcing you to choose what’s more important to you. This represents the center of Soul Sacrifice’s leveling system, one that does away with the statistical minutiae I admittedly prefer and instead focuses almost entirely on this binary feature. I chose to build my character evenly; at the time of this review, my character is level 28 in both categories, for a combined level of 56. But you can go all-in with one or the other or create a different sort of build that emphasizes magic over life or vice-versa. Furthering the open-ended feel of Soul Sacrifice are the choices you make in who you save and who you sacrifice at the end of battles. Virtually every boss enemy is, in reality, nothing more than a suffering human, and you can save or kill just about any person you meet to benefit your two ever-dueling statistics. Cooler yet, saved characters will join your party as AI allies that you can bring into battle. In other words, be very careful with the choices you’re making, because they most certainly matter. Meaningful consequences like these are very rarely a bad thing. Further character customization comes by way of powerful Black Rite attack spells, which represent the ultimate sacrifices. For instance, calling down flames on your foes will also burn you, halving your defense. Summoning a powerful set of ungodly melee weapons will make quick work of your foes, but also cause you to go mostly blind. This is an expertly executed cost/benefit system: it has real ramifications if used too often, especially because you’ll need to spend rare in-game currency called Lacrima to undo said ill-effects. Soul Sacrifice can be played entirely alone – I spent a vast, vast majority of my time playing on my own – but if you want to get online (or ad hoc via wifi) and play, you can do that too. Matchmaking options are surprisingly fluid, and it’s easy to invite some friends to a match. Gameplay is identical whether you’re by yourself or with friends (except that you're limited to a set of missions known as Avalon Pacts), and this is where Soul Sacrifice will likely find its long-term following. My in-game clock has me somewhere north of 20 hours in Soul Sacrifice. And speaking of clocks, I got mine cleaned as I did battle with the final boss, letting me know that I have more work to do. Even with this review behind me, I’m going to do that work, complete the uncompleted side quests and take on the final boss anew, because there's something admittedly alluring about Soul Sacrifice, even if it isn't Vita's killer app.",

        "Content": "Are you already a big Zumba Fitness person? Then you’re invited to Zumba Fitness: World Party. If not, you’re better off signing up for some classes first. World Party brings the dance-inspired workout into your living room by taking you around the virtual world to experience a large variety of rhythmic traditions. Dancing along with the on-screen instructor is fun, and it can get you sweating, but it’s not great at bringing uninitiated wallflowers into the party.  As the name implies, World Party takes a global look at cardio dance styles. The main mode brings you to Los Angeles, Puerto Rico, India, and more. Each location features an impressive number of songs, with each collection lasting around 20 to 30 minutes, and the music and movements feel different by region. There’s a lot of variety present, and you can earn postcards and souvenirs for doing well. They’re just trophies for bragging rights, of course - your health improvement should be the biggest reason to continue.  The goal is to mimic the dancer and move in beat with the music. The Xbox One’s Kinect sensor (which displays its reading of you on the lower corner of the screen) always appeared to do a fine job of tracking my movements accurately. The thing is, it didn’t seem to care – it kept flashing words like “Hot!” and “Nice!” though neither adjective could be reasonably used to describe what I was doing. Even though I’m a Zumba novice, I was able to pass most songs and unlock new ones with little trouble. If you’re new to Zumba as a workout and want to learn more, World Party is a tad too forgiving to be a good instructor.  That said, there is a training mode that allows you to isolate each dance move and practice it in normal or slow motion. It’s a nice extra mode that can help you nail the trickiest parts of a song, but it’s not as good at teaching you how to transition between the various moves. At least you can really isolate and master the booty pop.  For workouts where you don’t have time for the world tour, there’s a quick-play mode available for picking single songs, as well as a mode that emulates a more traditional Zumba workout.  A short, 20-minute workout features a handful of songs, and by the end your pulse will be elevated. This mode is convenient if you plan to use Zumba as a daily workout, as you don’t have to pick from individual songs, and it has dance variety built in. It pairs well with Zumba’s goal-setting feature, which lets you select the number of calories you want to burn, or the number of workouts you want to complete, and then assign yourself a deadline. It’s smart, because it grounds what you’re doing and sets up tangible fitness goals, which are essential motivators.",

        "Content": "Real golf doesn’t lack thrills – watching a player sink a delicate chip-in generates no shortage of excitement. But in the context of a video game, it needs some extra energy. A pizazz. An added enthusiasm, even if it’s when browsing a menu, just to keep it from becoming something you can sleepwalk through. PGA Tour 2K23 lacks that. It’s silent, it’s calm, it’s bland, it’s so… proper. PGA Tour 2K23 (and previously, PGA Tour 2K21) was born of HB Studios’ fanatically accurate simulation The Golf Club, and the change in name hasn’t changed much about the underlying philosophy behind it. The actual shot mechanisms, ball physics, and standard frustration when sinking into a bunker retain their dazzling authenticity, and yet, even with a year off between editions to rethink things, HB Studios has produced another plain, stuffy, elitist golf sim with as much personality as a white polo shirt. 2K23 makes minor strides towards loosening up the pomposity, but lands inches from dropping in the cup. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask 2K brings the points-based FedEx Cup into focus as the central career goal. That’s fine, although the PGA draws more attention for the Masters, US Open, and other high-profile events – the stuff EA licensed in the past for its golf projects. PGA Tour 2K23 doesn’t have those, or their most famous courses, like Augusta National. That means the career mode feels like filler as it works around licensing restrictions and takes us through second-tier courses like the Detroit Golf Club and TPC Southwind. That’s an issue when it’s the primary way to play, and here there aren’t a lot of other options. The career mode feels like filler as it works around licensing restrictions and takes us through second-tier courses. “ Taking to the course, the major publisher influence from 2K becomes evident. There’s an effort to streamline things, including an optional three-click swing system. That’s new, but brutally difficult to master, and not the accessible feature that was expected. This method involves holding the swing button to set power, releasing to begin a spinning meter that needs to be stopped twice to determine swing accuracy. If you’re anything like me you can expect botched shots on the regular before reverting to the smooth, clean, and precise analog stick swing. Who’s likely to be the breakout PGA rookie this season? Ben Griffin Davis Thompson Carl Yuan Thomas Detry Harry Hall Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results HB Studios mastered this analog method, thankfully. Other golf games have tried – and even succeeded in their own ways – but HB’s quest to mimic the feel and challenge of a real club pays off. It’s an appropriately fragile existence off the tee or from the fairway, as stick speed dictates a slice or hook. Even when well practiced, the possibility always remains to botch a shot – as it should be. Plus, 2K23 adds needed shot types like punches to squeeze the ball under hazards, furthering PGA Tour’s repertoire and strategy. Selectable golfers include NBA stars Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. “ There’s an attempt to add charisma to this series, but it comes across as half-hearted. Selectable golfers include cover star Tiger Woods and other known PGA names, but also celebrities like NBA stars Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. In the equipment section, a hockey stick is offered as a putter choice, giving necessary nods to Happy Gilmore. That’s it though, and those celebrity players exist only in side modes or versus play. Say what you will about the defunct Tiger Woods PGA Tour series, but maintaining golf’s central appeal while driving with Happy Gilmore’s walk-up swing was a delight, with no gameplay cost. There’s also TopGolf, a party-esque challenge founded in 2000. Now it’s digital, and a passable substitute for when short on time with friends, if also an uneventful target practice event unlikely to earn any long-term engagement. What We Said About PGA Tour 2K21 PGA Tour 2K21 is the most flexible and enjoyable golf game since EA’s Tiger Woods series was at its peak. While its career mode could have done with some spit and polish to its presentation and featured more meaningful rewards, it nonetheless serves as a solid 20-hour straightaway to what could prove to be the most thriving part of PGA Tour 2K21’s dance floor in the long term; the online societies. As far as establishing a new sports franchise goes (on the shoulders of the three Golf Club games that came before) this might not be the strongest shot off the tee, but it’s ended up in a very playable lie. – Tristan Ogilvie, August 20, 2020 Score: 7 Read the full PGA Tour 2K21 review Likely, the most time people are going to spend with PGA Tour 2K23 will be with the career, mostly because that’s almost all that’s offered. There’s one goal (FedEx), one play style, and outside of exhibitions, nothing else to do for solo golfers. Brief (usually) one-event rivalries using a Stableford scoring system bring the slightest additional drama. Local and online versus adds small variety like two-on-two match-ups and skins play. That’s something. Between matches the deepening RPG side offers incremental skill upgrades. Some offer easier swing timing, others accuracy, or better work out of bunkers. Leveling requires tiered decision making as each club type is individually boosted, and opportunities grow in tandem alongside the custom golfer’s XP meter. PGA Tour 2K23 - Release Date Announcement Screenshots 8 Images In a reversal of HB Studios’ usual philosophy, clubs themselves matter. Not just the clubs, but every boost to them, which are acquirable after winning events. A +3 club shaft of power matched with a +2 grip of shot shaping can form a credible weapon – err, piece of sporting equipment. Given PGA Tour 2K23’s demanding swing precision, even a tiny boost to accuracy or timing will reduce risks, and that’s appreciated. It’s a notably game-y idea for what is otherwise such a deep simulation though, and purchasing actual clubs makes no difference. Only the part boosts do. The quality of its attempt to recreate the atmosphere of televised golf is dismal. “ Moving toward the FedEx Cup means dealing with HB Studios’ weak point: The dismal quality of its attempt to recreate the atmosphere of televised golf. It’s not bad so much as utterly broken in places. Commentators make the wrong calls regularly, such as failing to identify when a ball is or isn’t on the green or whether it’s trailing left or right. Attempts to show replays from earlier in the tournament take excessive time to load in this era of SSDs (and chug further when trying to reach the server sometimes), and when they do show up they frequently don’t actually show anything. Rather than following the ball, these snippets stay on the golfer reacting to an unseen shot, but at least the character models justify that lingering attention. Coming from 2K, whose emulation of NBA broadcasts set a best-in-class example, PGA Tour 2K23’s non-functional delivery annoyed more than helped once I got past the first match’s introduction. As a side note, the orchestral music playing over the menus painfully adds to the idea of golf being a dull, elitist game. There was room for PGA 2K23 to build energy while maintaining its status, but it didn't take a single opportunity to do so. The recurring course creator lets people give PGA Tour 2K23 the spark if they so want it. That also helps fill in the course selection’s holes – someone will render an accurate Pebble Beach in no time (with titles like, “Pebbles on the Beach Golf Course”), although as I played before  release there was nothing available to download yet. That said, trying to build something offers a pleasant, easy-to-use menu system flush with choices. Better, everything is open from the outset, meaning there’s no need to unlock items to fill the spaces. Yes, a crocodile hiding out by hole 9’s green is just as much an option as placing a hotel on 16. Microtransaction Reaction Worried about the 2K label and its push for you to spend actual cash on virtual currency? Thankfully, this pressure isn’t as intrusive as in NBA 2K, and even though the in-game currency gains are absurdly small given the shop’s prices – unless clothing matters to you – there’s limited need to worry about it for now. Rewards are handed out frequently to keep leveling throughout the season, and since XP gains/club boosts are not for sale, everything is cosmetic.",

        "Title": "Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Review",
        "Subtitle": "Infinite Warfare delivers standard CoD action, but fails to distinguish itself in a crowded year.",
        "Subheader": "By Joab Gilroy Updated: May 2, 2017 6:17 pm Posted: Nov 7, 2016 9:50 pm",
        "Content": "A leap into futuristic space combat hasn’t breathed a lot of new life into Call of Duty. With a scenic but poorly paced single-player campaign and multiplayer and zombies modes that succeed mostly by sticking close to what Black Ops 3 did last year, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a generally fun but inessential shooter. 2016 has been one of the best years for single-player shooter campaigns of the past decade. We’ve seen Doom, Titanfall 2, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided… and they're all better than Infinite Warfare’s campaign. It's not for want of something to differentiate it: this is a Call of Duty game where you fight in zero-G environments, and where you fly a spaceship called a Jackal and have a robot buddy called Ethan who is endearingly written. It should be awesome... but it’s mostly slow and plodding, and by the time the pace picks up there’s not enough game left to wash the disappointment of the first two-thirds out of your mouth. In the campaign, you are the effortlessly charming Reyes, a United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA) Navy pilot with Tom Cruise-like features and swagger, and you're promoted to captain of a starship when the Settlement Defence Front (SDF) — a Mars-based terror organisation with significant resources — removes the previous captain from his command.  Every SDF quote would make a Sith Lord pause. “ You can tell the SDF are the bad guys because loading screens are littered with quotes from them, and every single one would make a Sith Lord pause. \"Freedom has no place in the light of our sun.\" That's a direct quote from the SDF High Council, and according to another loading screen the SDF has an Elite Propaganda Unit called The Veritas. If that's the propaganda the Veritas is letting out, imagine what other cartoonish evil they're hiding. Kit Harrington (Game of Thrones) leads them by way of a stereotypically evil British accent.   The entire cast works hard to keep you invested in the story. The dialogue is well written, even if the plot itself fails to make sense at times. For example, Staff Sergeant Omar (David Harewood of Homeland) sells his hatred of the robot E3N (Jeffrey Nordling from 24) like an android screwed him over on the Nostromo. And when he's best friends with E3N (or Ethan) in the next mission for unconvincing reasons, he sells that as well. The cast commit to their roles wholeheartedly.  Being that the SDF are literally freedom-haters and you are Joe America, it is your job to find and dismantle them, once and for all. Infinite Warfare contorts itself in an effort to nail that gung-ho, “Ooh-Rah” militaristic tone closely associated with the Call of Duty series, despite the science-fiction setting.  This is an action-movie universe where sound travels through space. “ Consistency is an issue which repeats itself throughout Infinite Warfare as it works hard to build out its Earth-versus-wayward-colonies fiction. It's heavily reminiscent of James S. A. Corey's The Expanse series, but it lacks the attention to detail necessary to make the science in the fiction stick. This is an action-movie universe where sound travels through space with ease, prolonged exposure to open space is survivable, and you can collide with things at hypervelocity without disintegrating. It acts like it wants to be a serious sci-fi story without giving up the dream of also being Star Wars. This is at its worst when you're shooting early on, because the ballistic weapons you start out with do too little damage to people in space.   This is a problem, because one of the few things Call of Duty can typically be counted on to deliver is the feel of a good shooter. Low time-to-kill (TTK) is one of the factors that creates the signature pace of the series, but Infinite Warfare messes with that. Too many enemies are armoured, increasing that TTK and forcing you to wait behind cover as you wear them down, slowing things dramatically. A cover-leaning system allows you to duck out without fully exposing yourself, but you still take a significant amount of damage as you acquire targets and shoot them – once to remove their helmet and again to put them down. On higher difficulties, it's safer to just wait behind cover until you’re regenerated and then charge back into action than to risk being beaned while leaning, rendering the cover system moot.  The tools to smooth out the combat are right there, but Infinite Ward doesn't want to let us use them. “ There's a wealth of weaponry and gadgetry available, but it's drip-fed to you at an unsatisfying pace throughout the campaign. Items like the Seeker drones and ATADs (automated robots designed to find your enemies and kill them) give you oodles of power while also feeling futuristic. Energy rifles, arcing laser cannons, and self-targeting shotguns demonstrate clever weapon design. But you spend most of your time without access to the stand-out heavy weapons (or without the ammunition to use them), which further increased my annoyance with the bullet-spongey enemies. The tools to smooth out the combat are right there, but Infinite Warfare doesn't want to let us use them.   As the story continues and your weapons get better, these problems solve themselves. Those energy weapons shred through the robots which litter the rear half of the campaign, and the pace picks up again as you careen towards the ending. Sadly, at five-and-a-half hours long, Infinite Warfare is just starting to feel good when it ends. In the final act, the action plays at a pace and tempo that few games can manage the way Call of Duty does. But prior to that final third, it feels like it's going on forever.  There just isn't five-and-a-half hours' worth of game in it. “ There just isn't five-and-a-half hours' worth of game in it. Compare it to last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, or even last week's Titanfall 2, and it seems ludicrous. Both have campaigns that are longer, but neither feels like they’re dragging along. They lack the flat spots peppered through the first two-thirds of Infinite Warfare, and both feature highly varied gameplay from moment to moment. Infinite Warfare, by contrast, is largely the same three gameplay loops repeated. You're either flying a Jackal (your dogfighting spaceship), shooting in corridors, or shooting in zero-G.   Part of the pacing problem comes from the fact that a significant portion of your time is spent treading water as you meander through the bridge of your capital ship, the Retribution. At the end of a mission you walk to the bridge – a 30-metre trek which exists to give you the option to watch a news story about a mission you just completed – and after you select your next mission, you walk yourself back down to the hangar bay. You stand on an elevator and engage in idle chitchat – it's reminiscent of Mass Effect's elevators, in that it's tedious and it's obviously hiding a loading screen behind the scenes.   I did the maths, and throughout the entire campaign there were roughly 28 combined minutes of walking to and from mission briefings and standing on elevators. When the other five hours are high-octane explosive action, half an hour of shipside downtime is extremely noticeable. It's filler, designed to pad out a single-player run that is lacking in real substance. Each time I found myself on an elevator it felt like those terrible episodes of Dragon Ball Z where Krillin and Tien would yap while Goku was just off screen, fighting the greatest fight of all time.   It combats the idea that Call of Duty is nothing but a linear corridor shooter. “ The Jackal side missions aren't much better. Infinite Warfare uses the briefing sessions to give you the opportunity to choose where you will fight next, giving you the opportunity to earn upgrades for your guns, your soldier, and your Jackal. It's a great idea, and it combats the idea that Call of Duty is nothing but a linear corridor shooter, but there aren't really enough missions or variety to make it worth the effort.  Some of them – the ground-tethered side missions – are actually good, offering some variation to the typical Call of Duty gameplay. Stealth is in play, and while that stealth gameplay isn't great thanks to dumb AI and a HUD which wasn't built for that style of play (a minimap would help so very much) the change of pace it creates is more than welcome.  But after you've struggled with the controls in one Jackal-focused mission, you've struggled with them all. The flying just isn't intuitive. You're able to shed too much speed too quickly, going directly from full thrust to a standstill in mere moments. Thrust is bound to an upward push of your left thumbstick and there is an element of analog control to it, but the moment you pull down on the thumbstick you kick into a slow reverse. Each time I did this in a dogfight I quickly started spinning over my Z axis, losing both my target and my orientation. Couple this with the fact that Infinite Warfare puts you in the shoes of an elite pilot without ever telling you how to properly fly – about three space missions in I was told I could press left or right on the D-pad to rotate on my X axis, and until then I'd been without this otherwise extremely useful tool.   There's also an issue with situational awareness in 3D space, because there's still no minimap in your HUD. That means you're reliant on danger indicators to tell you when you're being shot and from where. This isn't a huge problem, however, because the moment you lock onto an enemy you're *really* locked to them, and the ship does the majority of the flying for you. It's similar to Interdicting ships in Elite: Dangerous, except that in Infinite Warfare it's the entire dogfight instead of an exciting prelude to one. It makes every Jackal mission feel like the same thing with slightly different scenery: jump in, lock target, hold fire, switch. And the few times you get into an actual dogfight are over too quickly because you stop on a dime when you try to alter your thrust, dropping you out of the engagement.  It's difficult to work out where enemies are shooting you from. “ When you're in space but out of the ship, Infinite Warfare suffers again at the hands of its minimalist HUD. Whether you know it or not, so much of your own day-to-day orientation is handled by things other than your vision, but in a first-person shooter vision is really all you’ve got. Space-focused games have always struggled with this, and invariably their solution has been a 3D-oriented mini-map. By using you as the fixed point and displaying enemies based on their position in 3D space relative to you, Infinite Warfare could solve so many of its problems. Without one, and positioned against the backdrop of infinite darkness that is space, it can be frustratingly difficult to work out where enemies are shooting you from. Likewise, it's hard to find cover when your enemy can float above and behind you (as far as your perspective is concerned).  To solve this particular problem in a different, less effective way, Infinite Warfare highlights enemies for you at the beginning of an engagement, turning gunfights in zero-G into a memory game as you acquire as many as you can before the highlighting square disappears. Once gone, your only option is to look for tracer fire while floating in a disorienting vacuum and follow it back to its source.  This is a large part of Infinite Warfare's problem: for every great idea there's a Call of Duty trapping holding it back. And that's the mistake Infinity Ward has made – one of the same mistakes it made with Call of Duty: Ghosts three years ago, which was the series’ lowest point since The Big Red One. Infinite Warfare's campaign shows improvement over that game, but not much. Considering that if first-person shooter single-player campaigns are how you like to spend your time you're spoiled for choice this year, so there's little reason to spend it on this one.   Multiplayer  Multiplayer in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is where it shines. It's where the series has always shone, even when the single-player was worth playing. And thankfully, Infinity Ward does a much better job here. The key to success? Sticking close to the Black Ops 3 formula. Pick 10 is a fantastic system, because it's simple to understand while still allowing you to make your soldier your own. “ Infinite Warfare carries over the Pick 10 system, for example, with 10 points to pick your weapons, attachments, equipment and perks. This is a fantastic system, because it's simple to understand while still allowing you to make your soldier your own. Tough decisions, like whether to take extra equipment or deck out your gun with more attachments, give you something to do in between rounds – but it's not burdensome the way the Create-A-Soldier system was in Ghosts. Scorestreaks and Rigs (which are functionally the same as Black Ops 3’s Specialists) are kept separate from Pick 10, which means you're not giving up a weapon just to make sure you can take a UAV, and you know that every player has at least three perk-like abilities thanks to their Rig. Rigs define your basic character archetype. Synaptic is a speedy, mobile rig which focuses on hit-and-run style tactics, while Stryker is something of a builder, able to create turrets while alerting you to nearby enemies. The rigs are clearly identifiable in-game by their unique player model, but they're defined by their Payload and their Trait. FTL, another agile Rig, can equip the Eraser Payload to become highly lethal, using a pistol which evaporates enemies. Alternatively there are two payloads designed around escapability, like the Phase Shift which removes you from danger by putting you in an alternate dimension. But all FTLs can equip one of three perks to open up new possibilities: the Perception Trait, for example, allows you to know when someone is looking at you from off-screen, a replication of the Sixth Sense perk in Black Ops 3. In that sense, Rigs give you a rigid set of perks while inviting you to define your playstyle around them, which is a good thing. It allows you to work out how your enemy is playing without giving you an entire picture of what they're equipped with. By the same token, by using the Pick 10 system creatively you can still surprise your enemies with interesting combinations of perks and weapons.  Infinite Warfare plays a little slower than Black Ops 3, which I think was a necessary adjustment. Call of Duty has been getting faster and faster for years, but with Black Ops 3 it risked focusing on mobility to the extent that it raised Call of Duty's skill floor a little too high for my tastes. The balancing act for the series has always been based on allowing basically anyone to have fun while giving the elite players a high skill ceiling to reach for, and slowing things down just a touch is a good move in this sense.  Infinite Warfare's spawn system punishes those who leave their teammates to lone-wolf it. “ The only problem this slower pace creates is through the spawn system, which is noticeably worse than Black Ops 3. As it exists right now, Infinite Warfare's spawn system punishes those who leave their teammates to lone-wolf it. The way it works is that you will spawn back into the match depending on parameters laid out by Infinity Ward — they could be proximity to teammates, proximity to enemies, proximity to held objectives, anything — and if everything is going well, you'll have a few seconds to orient yourself before you get back into the fight. When things are not going well, you'll spawn directly in front of an enemy and die immediately. This is a problem with all games on small maps, especially as the teams spread out and mingle amongst one another. It can be extremely difficult for the spawn logic to determine a safe location, and spawning into death is a terribly unsatisfying way to die. And yet it’s happened to me multiple times over the past few days, usually when I'd run away from my group to try to get some cheeky flank kills. (Although the reverse happened too, where I'd sprint around a corner and an enemy would spawn and die before me).   Every match I’ve played thus far seems to use peer-to-peer (p2p) hosting. “ Another huge issue for Infinite Warfare is that in every match I’ve played thus far it seems to use peer-to-peer (p2p) hosting, where last year’s Black Ops 3 usually landed me on a dedicated server. Dedicated servers are essentially the base standard for shooters these days, and with good reason: with a dedicated multiplayer server, all players are treated essentially equal. The server stands in as the primary location for all information transfer, and the only difference available to players is in their personal infrastructure. With p2p-hosted games, the game is run and hosted from the one randomly chosen player's machine. The host has an advantage, because they are the server. Everyone else has the latency created by connecting to the server from a distance.  Dedicated servers also have the advantage of running dedicated hardware, and therein allowing the server to run at a higher tickrate. This means the information is processed by the server more times per second. Rainbow Six: Siege gave us a fantastic demonstration on the difference this can make: early on in Siege's life the servers ran at 30 hertz (at best), and as a result you would sometimes die to enemies you just couldn't see, or after you'd apparently already ducked back behind a wall. When the servers were upgraded to 60hz, instances of this decreased significantly (although they still occurred when players had pings over 200).  This disparity between what you see and what the game sees happens quite often in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and it's either because of lag on the end of the p2p host, or (if there is a dedicated server in the mix somewhere in Activision’s system) it's because the servers themselves aren't running at a tickrate similar to the speed the game runs at. The wonderful smoothness of having Infinite Warfare's multiplayer run at 60fps is negated a little if the servers (p2p or dedicated) can't keep up.   The map design is quite good in places, with the science-fiction setting of the campaign lending itself to a great deal of creativity. The designers do a good job of using the mobility features of the Rigs to provide options for higher-skilled players – many conflict areas have extra, sneakier entry points which are only available to players who can wall-run and double jump. The acrobatic gunplay this creates opportunities for is where Infinite Warfare is at its best, as great players clash mid-wall run like medieval knights on a vertical jousting field.  Maps like Mayday and Skydock lean heavily on wall-running to break up the map. Unfortunately, unlike in its wall-running competitor Titanfall 2, the areas where you can wall-run in Infinite Warfare are very strictly defined, in that not every flat surface can be wall-run upon and it's not always clear about whether you can or not. In practice this means that when you're pushed to the outskirts of a map, the narrow area of traversal turns you into a sitting duck — if your opponent appears ahead of you, you're unable to strafe and you're forced to run in a straight line at them.   Breakout is a map where this is less of an issue. It features a fairly traditional layout, with obvious lanes of conflict, varied sight line lengths, and many sneaky corners for cheeky camping opportunities. But it also uses wall-running to create less obvious routes for flanking. By relegating wall-running to flanking, the narrow corridors the walls create becomes less of an issue. It's not ideal – ideal would be a wall-running system which operated like Titanfall 2's, which empowers you with the ability to run on almost any vertical surface – but it's a great execution of the system as it has been implemented.  Frontier, which is closed off and features many tight corridors, is my least favourite map. Too many rounds of Frontier descend into automatic shotgun spamming spray-a-thons, as players crouch-slide in close and dispatch of their enemies before they can react, reducing the already quick time-to-kill to nanoseconds. On a map like Precinct or Throwback this strategy can still work, but it's restricted only the most agile of players thanks to a short maximum range on the shotgun's damage output.  This balance between map design and character loadouts is Infinite Warfare at its best. Since Call of Duty 4, the series has done a great job of letting you pick your poison, so to speak, by allowing you to learn the maps and create a soldier type which will enable you to best tackle that task. Infinite Warfare nails this philosophy with good map design, a low skill floor (and a high skill ceiling) and a variety of weapons which allows you to properly analyse a situation and then attack it.   Infinite Warfare's biggest multiplayer problems are solvable. “ I'm given hope by historical precedent that indicates Infinite Warfare's biggest multiplayer problems are solvable. Spawn logic can be tweaked – and I'm sure it will be –to minimise (if not eliminate) instances of players spawning behind you (or you in front of them). And the introduction of high-tickrate dedicated servers worked for Rainbow Six: Siege – there's no reason it wouldn't work here as well. Zombies in Spaceland  Zombies in Call of Duty has an (un)life of its own now. I count myself among the group of people who would happily to buy an annual update to the cooperative series-within-a-series (at a reasonable price). If you've been skipping the Zombies (and Zombie-like) modes in prior games in favour of the multiplayer, or if you’re new to Call of Duty, Infinite Warfare is the best place to start. Zombies in Spaceland dumps you and three other players into an abandoned theme park – its single map location – and then challenges you to live for as long as possible as it throws waves of undead park-goers, exploding zombie clowns, and fast-moving mutant boss zombies at you.  What makes Zombies in Spaceland work is simple: you learn by doing. Or perhaps it's “learn by dying.” Dying when social interaction is critical to the experience means more than it does in other circumstances, like in competitive multiplayer, because there's a sense of being in it together. If a teammate is downed you want to help them up to keep them playing, and if you die you feel like you're letting your team down. So where in competitive modes (where kills aren't the objective) you might happily respawn as fast as possible, in Zombies in Spaceland everyone operates as one to try to remain on their feet.   More than that, Zombies makes dying fun. When you drop in Spaceland and your teammates fail to get you up again, you’re warped to an afterlife arcade where you try to play and win your way back to life. Games like skeeball and water-pistol shooting provide an amusingly thematic way to challenge you to earn your way back into the 'real world', all while making sure you don't get a free pass straight back into it.  It's not enough to know where you need to go. “ The map lends itself to a silly sort of fun, with roller coaster rides, slippery slides, and David Hasselhoff DJing next to a cineplex. The traps around the world complement the mood, as tilt-a-whirl rides spin wildly to smash zombies and power-ups are spit out by carnival-style games. It loops back on itself repeatedly, adding to the required knowledge for those trapped inside the park. It's not enough to know where you need to go, because you need to know the fastest way to get there as well.  While still alive you earn progress through cash money, and this is where the delicate balancing act of survival is at its best. If you pay $1,000 to open a gate, you might not have enough to buy a new gun when you get through. And if you haven't the money for a gun, you're either going to have to use your weak starting pistol or you'll have to run all the way back to the beginning of the gauntlet to pick up a cheaper (and worse) weapon. If you choose to hold onto your money, you can frantically try to earn more by killing zombies or boarding up entry points — but in doing this, you're restricting the earnings potential of your fellow survivors as well.   Once I got into a rhythm with my co-op buddies, things started to click. Fate and Fortune cards are basically single-use Ultimate abilities, like the ability to throw infinite grenades for a period of time. If you can coordinate your use of those with your pals, you can really begin to dominate.  Nevertheless, you'll inevitably reach a point where raw skill can't overcome a sheer lack of understanding, and the tension critical to the Zombies experience returns. Suddenly you're frantically running away from a boss zombie while also trying to lure away undead to give a teammate the opportunity to revive another, conserving as much ammunition as you can. When you run out of ammo you buy the first gun you see, because it's better to have a sub-par gun than the default pistol. And eventually you'll die, just like the others. And then when you start again, you'll be armed with a little more knowledge, maybe a random friend you made along the way and a desire to make it a few waves further this time. It's not a complicated formula, but it works. And just as it did in the multiplayer, Infinity Ward does well to stick close to the recipe laid out by Treyarch. One area where it could improve is in the goofiness — Shadows of Evil, from Black Ops 3, new exactly how to balance menace and silliness to nail the B-Movie schtick essential to their Zombies games. Spaceland, on the other hand, leans a little too heavily on craziness.",

        "Content": "Look, I enjoy the realism and attention to detail of a FIFA game as much as the next person, but sometimes you just want to swallow the soccer ball, pop it out as an egg, and then bounce that egg downfield until it hatches and wizzes past the goalie. That’s just one of the incredibly silly moments that only the Mario Strikers series can provide, and Mario Strikers: Battle League is no exception. Trying to outmaneuver your friends and score a goal while engaging in a distressing amount of cartoon violence with no referee in sight had me howling with laughter one second and snarling in anger the next, and you can’t ask for much more than that. Although it’s been 15 years since Nintendo gave us the last Mario Strikers and shockingly little has been changed since then, that over-the-top mayhem and competitive intensity is a formula that holds up remarkably well. Mario's twisted version of soccer has two teams of four compete to kick, throw, headbutt, or butt-stomp a soccer ball into the rival team’s net in a highly chaotic fashion that only bears the faintest resemblance to the real-world sport that inspired it. The premise is simple to pick up and learn in a matter of seconds, but what’s impressive is how complex it can get as your skill and desire to win grows. Perfecting your power shots, learning to time your dodges, and figuring out how to best make use of on-field item pickups are all ways to make you a master out on the pitch. After a few hours of practice, it begins to feel similar to a well-tuned fighting game, where every action has a natural counter to it and each match becomes a test of your reflexes and ability to read your opponents’ intentions. That level of balance and depth is pleasantly surprising for what looks like a minigame you might find in Mario Party at first glance. Mario Strikers: Battle League Screenshots 10 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask A good example of that balance is in the ability to tackle enemy players to the ground at any time, immobilizing them for several seconds. That can feel pretty toxic if you’re playing against an especially rude team, and you might even be subjected to the completely awful experience of being repeatedly tackled even when the ball isn’t in your possession. But this scenario has a clever counter-measure: tackling someone who isn’t in the immediate vicinity of the ball grants that team a free item to be used immediately. So if the enemy is playing especially dirty, they’re also arming you with stuff like a bob-omb that can be lobbed back at them or an invincibility star that can give you free reign of the field for several seconds. In order to become a Battle League champion, you’ll need to learn the ins and outs of both those basic soccer techniques like passing, shooting, tackling, and handling the ball, as well as the ridiculous stuff like items and making use of your character’s special abilities and stats. While throwing a turtle shell at someone’s face brings no end of joy, the fundamentals still play a hugely important role in actually getting the ball in the net. For example, learning dodge at just the right moment grants you a short speed boost afterward, whereas getting the timing perfect when charging up your tackles or shots at the goalie makes them more effective – both of which can be extremely helpful in breaking through your opponents’ defenses. ...the fundamentals still play a hugely important role in actually getting the ball in the net. “ The characters you’ve chosen for your team are also an important factor in what you’ll be able to do in the heat of this fight of feet. If you’re playing as Toad, for example, you’ll be extremely fast but will also need to charge up all of your tackles if you want any hope of being able to take the ball away from someone beefy like Bowser. If you play as Donkey Kong on the other hand, you’ll be a face-slapping machine but also much slower. If a character doesn’t feel exactly the way you want them to, you can even buy gear with the coins you’ve earned from playing to augment their stats to be better in the areas you care about at the cost of being worse in others. Being able to tweak my Mario into a goalie’s worst nightmare with a maxed out Technique stat to curve my shots around them was extremely satisfying, and giving my Toad a full loadout of strength-enhancing gear so he could easily tackle some of the chunkiest enemies was enormously amusing. Plus, the gear actually changes each character visually, and dressing Rosalina up like she’s straight out of Tron just looks cool. The other major difference between characters is their Hyper Strike: a unique ultimate ability that lets you execute an absolutely ridiculous move to score points. These can be activated after picking up a floating orb that spawns on the pitch and include everything from Wario smashing the ball with his stinky butt to Rosalina literally kicking it into outer space until it comes crashing back down to the field – utter insanity. One of my favorites is Peach’s, who uses her charm to simply make the enemy fall in love with her so the goalie just voluntarily tosses the ball into his own net. Activating one of these moves requires clearing the field of enemy defenders so you can charge up your ability and play a short quicktime event to execute the move, but the risk involved is well worth it. Not only do you get to see a dope cutscene play out, but successfully pulling one off grants your team two points. This is all a lot of fun, but very little of Battle League strays far at all from what we’ve seen in the series before. Not only are all the central mechanics nearly identical to its predecessors on the Gamecube and Wii, but there are also fewer characters than in the past (just 10 total) which seems like an odd move. There’s no story mode or campaign of any kind either, and no game types aside from the standard one you play across every mode. It’s a pretty bare bones package all-in-all, even if that package is extremely replayable. The main offline mode is called Cup Battles, where you enter your team in a routine and extremely brief tournament against computer-controlled opponents with a trophy up for grabs if you can best the enemy. These tournaments are a great way to learn the ropes and build up your skills before playing with friends or in matches online, but they offer few surprises and only minor differences between each of the cups you can enter into – usually just different AI teams that use slightly tweaked strategies and items from each other. The good news is that some of the later cups offer a greatly increased difficulty for those looking for an increased challenge against the AI, but I wish there was more diversity in what each of the tournaments offer. ...the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight. “ Outside of the AI modes, it's pretty impressive that Battle League supports eight players on a single Switch, which makes it the perfect party game. It’s hard to beat the friendship-testing onslaught of dividing a room full of people against one another in a sport so immediately confrontational. That said, it’s a little disappointing that you can only play as one of the four runners on each team while the goalies are always computer-controlled, especially since those goalies are sometimes grossly incompetent and wildly inconsistent in their skill level from moment-to-moment. It would have been nice to let me assign that job to a real human I know I can trust, or can at least direct my rage at. But the biggest improvements Battle League makes over past entries is in its online multiplayer, which lets you join or manage a Strikers Club where you and your friends can compete against other clubs in a ranked playlist and claim seasonal rewards for reaching different divisions. Compared to the very limited online functionality available in the Wii-era Strikers, the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight. In my pre-release time with Battle League, I only briefly got to try out this mode, but so far it seems to have a surprising amount of bells and whistles to sustain a sweaty community of tryhards, which I fully intend to count myself among. My one gripe is that you can only join online matches with two players playing locally on the same Switch, which means you can’t take a full in-person hangout online without multiple systems.",

        "Content": "    Nintendo was in trouble. Its latest arcade game, Radar Scope, was a flop.  It was boring. Derivative. It was sinking NOA's ship - almost literally. It  was 1981, and thousands of Radar Scope upright cabinets were being delivered  by sea, traveling to the then-headquarters of Nintendo's American arm in New  York. As they made the journey to and through the Panama Canal, the company was in  a quandary. It needed a new game, and it needed it quickly. Its bank  accounts draining, there wasn't enough time to come up with an all-new  product, pack and ship it from Japan. The company would have to use what it had -  thousands of machines of Radar Scope. It'd have to improve the stinker. A young man named Shigeru Miyamoto had been working at Nintendo in Japan. He  hadn't been there long, and hadn't had much chance yet to show his quality.  He got it with Radar Scope. Called into the office of President Hiroshi  Yamauchi, the young Shigeru was tasked with improving the game. He accepted,  looked at what he had to work with, and promptly threw it out. Shigeru started from scratch, designing an all-new game that could be  installed as a retrofit on the Radar Scope board. Popeye was his  inspiration, as he sought to create a game starring the spinach-swallowing  sailor saving his sweetheart Olive Oil from the brutish bully Bluto. The  license, though, was unavailable. Nintendo was unproven. Miyamoto changed  his cast - Olive Oil became Pauline, the damsel in distress. Popeye became a  short and squatty hero in a red cap, called Jumpman. And Bluto he changed  into an ape - consulting an English-Japanese dictionary to find the right  way to say \"stubborn monkey,\" he ended up with the name Donkey Kong .  Donkey Kong created an all-new genre - the platformer.  Arcades of the day  were filled with space shooters or maze chases, but this game was different.    Here, players ran, climbed, and jumped.  It was a totally fresh  experience, guiding the hero along fractured girders and broken ladders,  jumping over barrels and wielding a giant mallet to eliminate enemies. Some  of the enviroments even had moving parts - elevators and conveyor belts that  added further novelty to the experience. It was like no game to ever come before, and the rest is history. Though  NOA's employees were skeptical of the game, it installed and modified the  Radar Scope cabinets into Donkey Kong machines and the game became a hit.  Second in popularity only to Pac-Man at its height, Donkey Kong went on to  inspire merchandising, sequels and even a cartoon show. The character  Jumpman was later renamed and is better known today as Mario, a mascot who  has gone on to have some moderate level of success for Nintendo himself. Donkey Kong was Nintendo's first big hit. It established the company's name  and provided their foundation. It introduced the company's most important mascot  character, without whom it would never have achieved the success and  longevity enjoyed in the ensuing 25 years. And its design still  holds up today.  Playing DK on the VC is a great, nostalgic experience - it  controls well with a Wiimote, Cube or Classic Controller, and you can see  the excellence of Miyamoto's early work shining through in the smallest  details. There's a lot of fun still to be had with this grand gorilla. And looking  back on the company's history, Donkey Kong is arguably Nintendo's most  important game. Don't download it. Don't download it, because this isn't the true Donkey Kong. This Virtual  Console release is of the NES version of the arcade classic, not the arcade  classic itself. Whereas the coin-op original had four full levels of play,  the NES conversion only has three - it's only 75% complete. And on top of that, the opening cutscene - where DK climbs the first stage  and stomps the girders into place - is removed. The interstitial animations  between stages - removed. The final scene, with Jumpman rescuing Pauline and  DK crashing to the ground below, actually is there. But nothing else. That's  kind of a big deal, since Donkey Kong was the first ever game to contain a  full narrative structure, telling a story with a beginning, middle and end.  Books have been written on this subject, I kid you not. But Nintendo, for whatever reason, has continued to promote this crippled  port for years. On the NES. On the e-Reader. On the GBA as part of the  Classic NES Series and in Animal Crossing on the GameCube. This is not the  complete Donkey Kong. Not the first masterpiece game that established  Shigeru Miyamoto's career. It's a cut, condensed and compromised conversion,  and its promotion really just needs to stop.",

        "Content": "Nearly 10 years ago, former Need for Speed developer Ghost Games copped a kicking for making its 2015 series reboot online-only, even in single player. In response, its 2019 follow-up Need for Speed Heat did not require a persistent online connection. Earlier this year, Ubisoft decommissioned The Crew, making it impossible for owners to play from now on – even by themselves. The move wasn’t received well. This very week Ubisoft has confirmed The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest will now get offline modes. In contrast to these course corrections, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown arrives in 2024 as another online-only racing game that seems to have little interest in being something that’s satisfying to play solo. It’s a baffling start and, despite a nice handling model and a lot of effort on display in its unique open world, it unfortunately doesn’t get any better. The original Test Drive Unlimited was a pioneer of MMO, open world racing. It was the pioneer, really, and remarkably ahead of its time. However, despite being fondly remembered for its trendsetting online philosophy, 2006’s Test Drive Unlimited still had a dedicated single-player mode (one that remains accessible and playable offline today). It simply layered its multiplayer mode over the top of it. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The always-online Solar Crown is not built like this, and it’s infinitely poorer for it. There are AI opponents, but there’s no dedicated single-player mode to speak of – just a map full of events that other players may or may not hop into at the same time as you. During my time with it, prior to the standard edition release date, another player joining my race has actually been an extremely rare occurrence. But the threat of it is always there, because there’s no way to opt out. This puts Solar Crown in a very weird place. It means that, even though my experience has almost exclusively been competing solo against the AI, I’m still burdened by all the foibles of online racing. This means lobby countdowns I can’t fully skip before starting a race, even though I don’t want to wait for anyone else and wish to start by myself. It means races I can’t even pause, which is an absurd problem to have when playing entirely against AI – and totally contemptuous of parents and anybody else with the audacity to ever need to… stop what they’re doing for a moment. It also means races don’t even have a simple, quick restart option; to restart you need to abandon the race entirely, re-enter the event, and sit through the same lobby period. Even when you’re the only human in an event, if there’s a connectivity issue during your race, you’ll be kicked out. If there’s a problem in free roam, you’ll be kicked out to the menu screen. Hell, if there’s some sort of server maintenance or technical snag when you boot up, you won’t be able to play at all. In my most recent session I haven’t been able to play for more than a few minutes at a time before being kicked out. Every online-only requirement feels like a punishment for playing it by yourself. You don’t want to play with other people? Too bad, you’re online anyway. Turn That Crown Upside Down Unfortunately, the racing itself is not strong enough to make these online quality-of-life sacrifices worthwhile. At its best, on Solar Crown’s most well-plotted race routes, the racing is… fine. At its worst, however, it’s tedious and unsatisfying. The AI opponents are a constant sore point, and they undermine the experience by being rubbish in some conditions and supernaturally gifted in others. Solar Crown features a handful of named difficulty levels for its AI opponents but, unlike other racing games, it does not let us manually select their strength. This means Solar Crown automatically bumps up the difficulty as we progress. The spike, however, from ‘Experienced’ to ‘Expert’ is hideously ill executed – so your reward for good performances against the ‘Experienced’ opposition is simply a bad time. Now, I should stress that you don’t actually need to win, or even podium, in Solar Crown’s races to earn credits; a better finishing position just results in a little extra gravy on top of a base payment for completing the race. There is, however, a list of secondary objectives that regularly do require you to be at the pointy end in specific events. This can be daunting against rival racers who – on some courses – will simply gallop away from you in cars that ostensibly have the same performance level as yours, recording race times that can be faster than the quickest human players on the current global leaderboards . Do you prefer your racing games open world or as self-contained races? Open world Individual races Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results This is a ridiculous problem to have, and it’s one you can’t solve by simply opting out of the Expert AI setting. Again, we don’t actually have the ability to adjust it. It’s also not as straightforward as selling a car you’ve discovered is uncompetitive in the current class you’re grinding through and buying something that seems quicker, because you can’t sell cars. If you’ve just dropped a ton of credits on something that’s not working out, it’s back to the grind until you can amass enough to try again. It’s set to be quite a grind, too; some of Solar Crown’s hypercars are priced at over 10 million credits , whereas a typical win only nets you around 20- to 30-odd thousand. There are no driving missions here like in the old TDU games; it’s just basic racing, repeated. As far as I’m concerned, if a game starts to feel like a job, something is amiss with the pace of progression. At any rate, the only solution is to complete and lose races , and wait until the automated difficulty decides to do you a favour and bump things down a notch – to a place where the AI racers aren’t capable of driving faster than the entire player base. This is a total waste of time, but it gets worse. After being stalled chasing the objective on one particular race, Solar Crown started slashing my payouts and XP for subsequent attempts. By the time I eventually completed the goal, the credits and XP had been cut to a pittance and were virtually worthless. Several days later I noticed the payouts had returned to normal, but nothing about an apparent cooldown period on rewards is communicated to us in-game. Why are we being strung along with come-back-later mechanics like mobile gamers? Solar Crown just doesn’t feel like it respects your time. The racing isn’t unsatisfying because it’s tough ; it’s unsatisfying because it’s inconsistent, and it often feels like the AI is cheating. “ At the other end of the spectrum, in wet weather conditions, off road, and on certain circuits, AI opponents can be counted on to be much weaker. The counter intuitive thing here, however, is that these instances of slow or boneheaded AI tended to arrive as moments of relief – especially in the wake of a race I’d lost by, say, not being the single fastest person on the planet . To clarify, the racing isn’t unsatisfying because it’s tough ; it’s unsatisfying because it’s inconsistent, and it often feels like the AI is cheating. There’s nothing fun about sinking a huge amount of credits into a car to put it at the top of a performance window and having it totally unable to compete against opponents at the exact same level. It’s even worse when cars with lower performance ratings are gapping you on straights. There are clearly strings being pulled to make this happen, and that’s just cheap. Is it better against humans? I can’t issue a verdict on that. While special edition Solar Crown buyers have been playing since last week, I’m really not encountering anybody. Only once have I started a race and been grouped with someone else apparently starting the same race a few seconds later. If anything, the racing was worse ; the AI bots that filled the remaining six slots in this case seemed twitchier, heavier, and drove like I wasn’t there. But beyond that, nada. There are dedicated ranked races on the map, but they don’t appear to be attracting anyone yet. I’ve sat in the lobbies for those and have seen no one join me. While other racing games will pool interested players into quick races, Solar Crown seems like it’s relying entirely on people just… deciding to trigger the same race at the same time. Stressed Drive Levelling up will eventually unlock new tyre compounds and pre-set driving modes that let us eek some more speed out of our cars, but there’s so much contradictory information in these options it’s hard to know what will ultimately help. At level 30, I decided to purchase a Nissan GT-R and scanned the driving modes before my first event. Dynamic mode, which claims to boost acceleration, only lowered my acceleration stat. Sport mode, which Solar Crown reports will lower my acceleration, actually raised it. So what do I go with? What’s going to help? Well, it’s slower than the rest of the field in either configuration, so who can say? It’s a mess. The annoyances continue. The world is particularly handsome at night in the neon bathed streets, but there are sections that suffer reproducible pop-in, or objects cars can clip through. When on foot, button prompts disappear the instant you run too close to the door you want to open or person you want to speak to. You can’t easily invert the camera – you have to manually remap the controls for forward and back on the stick. Locations I’ve already discovered and have unlocked fast travel to are becoming unavailable. I can no longer use them for fast travel, despite the roads around them clearly indicating I’ve been to them before (and Solar Crown ultimately knowing I’ve been there before, because it won’t re-reward XP for “re-discovering” them). Driving to places I’ve already unlocked is more wasted time, so it’s a bug a game that’s already filled with time-sucking, always-online caveats and non-adjustable difficulty settings definitely didn’t need. On top of that, roads driven on during races don’t actually count as driven on in your game; you have to drive over them in free-roam to add them to your tally. Is this intentional, or just another bug? Hard to say, but either way it’s more double handling. There are a lot of things I enjoy about Solar Crown’s Hong Kong, but it lacks atmosphere overall. “ It may sound by now that Solar Crown really gets nothing right, but that isn’t true. Crucially, it boasts a predictable and approachable handling model that’s easy to get to grips with. It’s arguably a little understeery, and the drastic speed reduction from hitting roadside destructables feels too heavy-handed for an arcade racer, but it drives quite well and is definitely a step up from the divisive feel of Test Drive Unlimited 2. There are also a lot of things I enjoy about Solar Crown’s Hong Kong map. There’s a good mix of variety in terms of road width, from extremely narrow one-way alleys and accessways, to snaking hillside roads reminiscent of KT Racing’s own WRC games, to wide freeways and tunnels. There’s an eye-catching level of complexity to Solar Crown’s on- and off-ramps, and I really love the look of the many underground, polished-concrete parking garages that lurk everywhere under the city – complete with working boom gates. Unfortunately, it lacks much in the way of atmosphere overall, and this version of Hong Kong certainly doesn’t feel like a living city in the same way it does in the likes of Sleeping Dogs. Sure, it’s an adjacent genre and the driving physics in Sleeping Dogs are sloppier than a soup sandwich, but it stands up as a world. In Solar Crown, people are rare and the futuristic augmented reality overlays are an eyesore. Virtual parking lane notifications are constant, ugly screen clutter, and the giant, identical AR lettering over key locations just makes everything feel the same. Of course, when you do enter dealerships – with their enormous layouts and sparse arrangements of cars – it’s evident they all look the same inside, anyway. They look nothing like the convincing dealerships in TDU1 and TDU2. The Best Racing Games Ever Tuna, no crust.

The car selection is a letdown, both compared to its current peers and the original Test Drive Unlimited games. In 2006’s Test Drive Unlimited, for instance, a majority of the cars featured were current models released within a few years of its arrival. Classic cars still appeared, but the line-up felt fresh and cutting edge. Solar Crown doesn’t really have that same flavour. Only a tiny sliver of the cars here are even from this decade, so there’s an unavoidable staleness. Japanese cars have always been significantly underrepresented in TDU, but if you were thinking the geographical proximity at play with Solar Crown might trigger an increase, it absolutely has not. We get a 2011 Nissan 370Z, and a 2009 GT-R. That’s it. There are some details I do really like, though, and there’s been some impressively granular work done regarding car sound. The hiss of wet asphalt or the bark of your exhaust note changing tone and volume as you wind down the window during the rain or in a tunnel is particularly lovely stuff. The visual effects for rain in cabin view still aren’t as good as the ones in the 10-year-old Driveclub, but I’ve been saying that about all racing games for a decade now.",

        "Subtitle": "Sticking to the game plan.",
        "Subheader": "By Mitchell Saltzman Updated: Jan 14, 2021 3:00 am Posted: Aug 14, 2020 7:01 am",
        "Content": "After laying down a clunky but promising foundation with their first UFC game in 2014, EA Vancouver has done a respectable job of iterating and improving on each new entry over the last six years. That tradition continues in EA Sports UFC 4. It focuses on making its many complex systems a little less intimidating for newcomers without ever taking away from the depth of its multi-layered combat, thanks to a new grapple assist system and a much improved career mode that does a better job of teaching the basics of the many facets of mixed martial arts. Some of the larger ambitions of career mode fall a bit flat and the ground game still feels like it could use some work, but all things considered, UFC 4 is a win for MMA fans.  Every IGN UFC Game Review 11 Images  Unlike UFC 3, which dramatically revamped the entire striking system, UFC 4 is more about small but necessary adjustments as opposed to grand overhauls. The biggest difference this time around is the clinch game, which no longer just feels like a stand-up version of the ground gameplay. Instead of having to navigate through clinch positions just to get to a spot where you can escape, all you have to do to break a clinch is move away from your opponent. You’ll likely still eat a few shots, but as long as you have room to back up, breaking a clinch is much easier to do. That said, if you get caught in a clinch with your back against the fence, you’ll find yourself in a very tough spot, especially against a fighter that excels there.  It’s a smart change, as it makes the clinch game feel like a natural extension of the standup combat rather than its own separate minigame. With this new system you can very organically go from strike to clinch, and from there decide whether you want to attack the head, attack the body, push the opponent up against the cage, or, for some fighters, even go for a standing submission ala Jon Jones vs Lyoto Machida. The clinch game now feels like a natural extension of the standup combat. “  The other big change this time around is with submissions, which has actually been split into two different types of minigames: one for chokes and one for joint submissions. Both minigames are essentially a race to be the first one to either fill up the submit meter or the escape meter. For chokes, the attacker must fill the submit meter by using the left stick to move a bar around a circle in an attempt to cover the defender's bar. The defender, meanwhile, fills their escape meter automatically as long as they're not covered by the attacker. For joints the concept is basically the same, except you use the triggers to move your respective bar left and right. The big challenge for the defender is that your bar increases in size the more you move, so just wildly spinning the control stick or spamming the shoulder buttons like a wild person doesn’t work. That rewards a more careful, cat and mouse-style mind game when compared to the much more erratic gate submission system of prior games.  Another really cool addition is that some fighters that are especially skilled on the ground can even gain opportunities to counter certain submissions with either a slam or even a counter-submission, like a Von Flue choke. Not only is this awesome because it’s very true to the actual UFC experience, but it also balances the risk/reward factor of going for a submission when you’re not in a dominant position somewhat.  Finally, EA Vancouver also introduced a grapple assist system for those that might not know their full guards from their half guards, their side controls from their mounts, or their rubber guards from their mouth guards. When using grapple assist, instead of transitioning to specific positions while on the ground, you can just choose to transition based on what it is you want to do. If you want to move to a position that allows you to get up, just keep on pressing up on the right stick until you’re able to get up. If you want to ground and pound, keep on pressing right to eventually transition to a position where you can do some ground and pound. And if you want to do a submission, just hold left and you’ll transition to a position that lets you perform a submission.  It’s not ideal, because sometimes you need that extra level of specificity to land better ground and pound or get access to better submissions, but for those who are just picking the game up for the first time, it’s a great shortcut to start having fun without having someone explain to them what all the different positions mean, which ones have submissions, and which ones you can get up from. Of course, there’s also the legacy control scheme along with a new hybrid control scheme that combines the two, allowing you to transition to specific positions with the right stick and use the more general assist transitions with the left stick, which is a nice compromise.  The ground game still feels largely unsatisfying in UFC 4. “  Outside of those big changes and a couple of other small control adjustments, the gameplay in UFC 4 is largely the same, which for the most part is fine. UFC 3 already did a great job of revamping striking, but the ground game still feels largely unsatisfying in UFC 4. Ground and pound strikes still lack impact, despite having dis-proportionally loud sound effects; the guessing game of transitions and transition denials is still incredibly unintuitive without the guide arrows, which are removed in online play regardless of whether you’re playing casually or in ranked; and there’s still no feedback provided to let you know why you failed a transition, leaving you to guess as to whether it was because you were too slow, you hit the wrong direction, your opponent had grapple advantage, or any of the other factors it could be.  The Life of a Fighter  UFC 4 treats its career mode as an onboarding tool to get new players very quickly up to speed with the basics, and in that way, it’s very successful. After getting your ass kicked in your very first amateur fight, you’re taken under the wing of fictional former UFC fighter, Coach Davis. Davis serves as an extended tutorial that walks you through the various facets of MMA, and importantly, after every lesson you’ll have an amateur fight against an opponent that specializes in that discipline, allowing you to really soak in what he teaches you.  After you get through all of your amateur fights, UFC 4’s career mode settles into the familiar groove established in UFC 3’s career mode. You get a fight offer, you choose how to spend your 100 weekly points leading up to it, and then you fight. The best new change this year is in the fighter evolution system that allows you to improve specific moves simply by landing them in a fight or in training. The more you use a move, the better it will get, letting you craft a fighter that truly feels unique to you. Bumping a move up to the next level also awards you with evolution points that you can use to improve your overall stats and add powerful perks that further define your strengths.  There’s a lot of stat building and decision making that takes place in between fights, but thankfully it’s all good fun because you really do see the effects of your training paying off. It also helps that the training itself is fun since it’s mostly two-minute sparring matches – even if it’s a little too easy to knock your training partners out cold.   Less effective is the emphasis on player choice in the story, which feels a little half-baked. Occasionally throughout your career, you’ll be given opportunities to choose how you respond to certain social media posts from fighters, or how you react to certain events, such as a fighter pulling out of a fight due to injury. The idea is that these decisions create rivalries and storylines between you and other fighters, but because all interactions are handled through short social media posts in a submenu, I never really cared about any of them. There is a gameplay element to it all, in that, if you have a bad relationship with a fighter, you won’t be able to invite them to your gym and learn one of their signature moves, but the trade off is that when you potentially fight down the line, there will be more hype to it. None of that ever really made much of a difference for me though, because there are already so many other fighters to invite to your gym, and the fighters that I did start a beef with early on never resurfaced once I started climbing the ranks.  A big historical problem for the UFC series was the huge difficulty spikes once you got into title contention, which thankfully are no longer an issue this time around. You’re able to set your difficulty right from the start, which stays pretty consistent all throughout as long as you’re being diligent about upgrading your fighter, though the moderate difficulty AI seems to not quite understand how to escape from submissions. You are also able choose whether you want to retry a fight, or accept the consequences of the loss and continue on with a blemish on your record, which is a nice choice to have, especially since some of your ultimate “Greatest of All Time” goals are tied to getting consecutive wins.  Mixed Martial Modes  UFC 4 thankfully removes the sleazy Ultimate Team Mode of prior UFC games, and though it doesn’t replace it with anything nearly as substantial, there are at least a couple of fun new stages that are refreshingly different. There’s a new backyard arena that feels especially fitting for cover athlete Jorge Masvidal, along with a very Bloodsport inspired Kumite arena, complete with over the top sound effects and cheesy music.  There’s also a new Blitz Mode that serves as a fun little distraction for online play. In Blitz, the rules are constantly changing every few hours. One ruleset might involve only having one round that lasts for one minute, another might have you playing a best of three game of knockout mode. It’s a cool idea, and one that I wish I got to spend more time with, though unfortunately there just weren’t that many people playing in during the EA Access First Trial period.  What's the Best Combat Sports (Boxing, MMA, Wrestling) Video Game Series? Fight Night UFC Undisputed EA Sports UFC WWE 2K Punch Out! Other Answer See Results  UFC 4 also introduces Daniel Cormier to the commentary team who does a wonderful job and serves as an excellent replacement for Joe Rogan, even though I could probably do without him and Coach Davis repeating the same line about fighting being chess instead of checkers over and over again.  Lastly, while UFC 4 still looks pretty good, it’s a little disappointing to see that so little has changed in the game’s looks over the last six years. While there are a few new animations added into the mix, these are largely the same takedowns, slams, and strikes that we’ve seen before. There’s a little bit more face deformation this time around during slow-mo replays, but knockouts are still lacking a certain magic that the Fight Night series captured a console generation ago.   Microtransaction Reaction  UFC 4 utilizes an in-game currency called UFC Points that can be purchased with real money in bundles costing between $.99 and $99.99. The points can only be used to buy cosmetic items for your custom fighter, such as unique tops, bottoms, gloves, mouth guards, emotes, taunts, and other accessories. These items can also be earned in game as a random reward for leveling up your profile through completing various challenges in both offline and online modes. Overall, it’s pretty standard fare as far as microtransactions go, and at least there’s a reasonable way to unlock items by just playing the game. ",

        "Title": "Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Swing and a miss.",
        "Subheader": "By Daemon Hatfield Updated: May 8, 2012 4:38 pm Posted: Feb 8, 2011 1:50 am",
        "Content": "Bionic Commando Rearmed, released in 2008, is a very special game. It took an already excellent NES classic and expertly updated it with modern pleasantries. The swinging mechanics and lack of ability to jump has always set Bionic Commando apart from other platformers. Developer Grin built on that uncommon foundation in 2008, adding new bosses, levels, and the rare video game soundtrack that I wanted to download to my iPod.  Its sequel, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 , does not feel special. Perhaps it's because it isn't a remake of a classic -- there was never a sequel to Bionic Commando on the NES. Whatever the reasons, this original adventure feels like the cheaper direct-to-video follow-up to a blockbuster action film. There's still some fun to be had, but it's been stripped of its individuality.    It's rather baffling that jumping has been added to Rearmed 2. Now you can leap and bound over levels with considerably more ease. Granted, you don't have to jump, and the game will make note of it and grant you an achievement or trophy if you make it through every level without using your legs to leave the ground. But now there isn't as much focus on interesting swinging challenges.  What swinging there is has been made more cumbersome by removing the ability to just hold the analog stick or d-pad in the direction you want to swing through and release -- now you have to tap a button to release, adding an extra step to the process.  The level design isn't exciting. When I would finish a level I didn't think, \"Wow, that was awesome!\" It was more of a \"Well, I just played a level in a video game.\" You're encouraged to do a lot of backtracking to previous areas to find new equipment after you've upgraded your skills, but returning isn't necessary.  A few of the upgrades are fun to play with, though, such as the Electro Claw, which can be used to shock enemies like a taser. Several passive upgrades have been added, such as health regeneration.  However, health regeneration is so valuable I never wanted to use anything else. Other new gameplay additions include brief sniper and helicopter-flying sequences, but all of these sequences lack depth.  There is one particularly cool boss fight against a machine called the Titan about midway through the game,but the other two large bosses are recycled multiple times with slight adjustments to their patterns. When you finally take down the evil dictator at the end, his warship explodes and falls off the screen in silence without any sound effects.    The original Bionic Commando Rearmed impressed with its high production values. Rearmed 2 feels more like a budget title. The music isn't quite as good, the controls don't feel perfect, and the story was forgotten as soon as I experienced it. I've just finished the game, for instance, and I really can't tell you what happened in any great detail. Some dictator was trying to launch a missile and the Bionic Commando had to run around and shoot people. That's all I remember. Those enemies you're shooting have very little variety – you're still facing the same brain-dead cronies in the final stages as you were in the beginning.  Two and a half years ago, Rearmed's visuals were quite impressive for a downloadable game, but since then, more and more great-looking games have been released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Rearmed 2's graphics still look like they're from 2008. I went back and played the first Rearmed again while working on this review, and I think it still looks better than this sequel. How does that work?  The story can be played through with a friend locally in its entirety, but adding a second Commando doesn't change the game at all. Outside of the story, the Challenge Rooms return, offering fun time challenge diversions. You are presented with a difficult obstacle course and must make it to the exit in as short a time as possible.  Made it in record time?  Upload your results to the leaderboards.  Good stuff.",

        "Subtitle": "A gorgeous, rewarding, and self-renewing driving experience that raises the open-world racing bar yet again.",
        "Subheader": "By Luke Reilly Updated: Apr 21, 2020 2:04 am Posted: Sep 25, 2018 7:01 am",
        "Content": "Forza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards. Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal. All of this is on top of what’s essentially the traditional Horizon experience: dozens, and dozens, and dozens of races and activities spread across a host of disciplines. Racing, rally, drift, drag, editing your own events with Horizon Blueprint: the lot. With this many cars, this much customisation, and a never-ending stream of things to do, it seems Forza Horizon 4 wants to prove being here for a good time AND a long time aren’t mutually exclusive. Midlands Madness This is all largely made possible by Horizon 4’s new default nature as an online, shared-world racer where all the other non-traffic cars cruising the open world are human players. We still race against AI – unless you elect to race with or against friends and such – but you’ll be sharing the open world itself with the rest of us, doing our own thing. It’s not unlike a more intimate version of The Crew, though the difference is it’s not compulsory. You can play entirely offline if you want, and being knocked offline for any reason isn’t an issue, either, because it’s smart enough to seamlessly transition between its offline and online state in the background while you continue playing. It happened to me a couple of times and there was no loss of progress at all. You can play entirely offline if you want, and being knocked offline for any reason isn’t an issue. “ Even as an antisocial grouch when it comes to multiplayer, I honestly found no good reason to remove myself from the online environment. Pausing, rewinding; that all still works, even online. And strangers are ghosted on contact, too – during both free roaming and Forzathon Live events – so no one can interrupt your cruising or stunt driving unless you link up and join a convoy with them, at which point collisions are in effect. It’s worthwhile to participate, too, because the points picked up from completing Forzathon challenges form a second in-game currency, separate from the regular credits earned racing. These ‘Forzathon points’ can be redeemed at a separate shop for rare cars and other vanity items, including emotes that seem to range from ‘memes from when Vine was still a thing’ to ‘yep, that’s that dance my kid does forty times a day.’ It’s a bit like the mileage exchange in GT Sport. It seems most of this stuff can also be won randomly as you level up and, while I’m not a big fan of slot-machine style prizes, it should be noted there are no microtransactions involved and no performance upgrades are gated behind it. Whether the piles of emotes, avatar clothing options, and novelty horns grab your fancy will be a matter of personal preference. As someone who’ll happily wear the same jeans and hoodie for a decade I’m a little numb to fashion, personally, but the GTA Online-style victory dances are pretty cute. A Crazy Shade of Winter There’s a glimpse of all four seasons during the four- to five-hour introduction phase, but once the prologue’s first “year” is over seasons will rotate weekly (online or offline). It’s been Autumn throughout the bulk of this review and it might just be my favourite season. There just seems to be so much detail, from the spectrum of colours in the trees as their leaves die off at different rates, to the soggy roadside puddles that persist in an environment that’s becoming too cool for them to evaporate. Winter is excellent, too. If you’ve played Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain, you’ll have a basic idea of what to expect. It’s not just the world turned white; the landscape takes on an entirely new identity. Every IGN Forza Game Review Ever 17 Images I can’t quite vouch for the more granular details of the environment that Playground Games nailed so well in Forza Horizon 3 because I don’t live in Britain, but overall Horizon 4’s Britain is just dazzling. It’s a place filled with quaint little towns, quiet farms, and snaking country roads lined with hedges and crumbling stone walls. Babbling brooks, dense forests, a wide beach, rocky mountaintops, castles, and other centuries-old structures are scattered all across the map. There also more life to it, with deer, rabbits, chickens, and some amazingly agile sheep in residence. The star of the map is Edinburgh, which is much prettier than Horizon 3’s Surfers Paradise. “ It’s gorgeous and I’ve enjoyed exploring it immensely. On Xbox One X I’ve opted to stick with the game’s default “Quality” mode (native 4K, HDR, 30 frames per second) because I’ve been content with playing Horizon games locked at 30 fps in the past, but there is also a “Performance” mode (which cranks up the framerate to 60 and sets the resolution at 1080p, also with HDR). Dawn and dusk in particular are incredible showcases for Horizon 4’s lighting, and it’s these times of day I most enjoy for some more gentle cruising. The overt distinctions between zones aren’t as stark as they are in Horizon 3’s Australia, which shifts from extremes like dry orange desert to dank rainforest, but a massive increase in elevation differences makes up for that. Having Horizon 4’s roads wind over so many hills results in more interesting driving. There’s also a wider difference between road types, which range from wide, modern motorways to narrow alleys and quirky junctions that could’ve been designed hundreds of years before the invention of internal combustion. The star of the map, however, is Edinburgh, which is much prettier than Horizon 3’s Surfers Paradise. Edinburgh in Horizon 4 is a beautiful place, oozing with history and boasting a really interesting road layout. It’s probably my favourite place to joyride. Petrolhead Paradise The supporting cast of cars is the biggest it’s ever been in the series, and also the most eclectic, with rides ranging from the 59-kilogram Peel P50 microcar to the ludicrously large Unimog, which is fun but so big it can actually cause the chase camera a spot of grief sometimes when passing under structures. As a car nerd I particularly enjoyed how exceedingly British the barn finds have been, representing a really respectful and well-rounded cross section of British car culture. Mitsubishi seem to have joined Toyota/Lexus in backing out of the Horizon series (for now, at least) but there are 450 cars from more than 100 other manufacturers in Horizon 4, so there are plenty of other options. Cars with special body kit options and other unique accessories are again sorted into their own tab for those keen to acquire vehicles with the most customisation options. Forza Motorsport 7’s new drift suspension and tuning options are present in Horizon 4, and drag tyres have also made their way across. There’s even a new track width option available for certain cars, which I’ve tried on a few older vehicles. Spacing the rears out on my A9X Torana certainly helps it look a lot more racey, rather than having the tyres under the wheel arches. Vulcan versus Vulcan (or, at least, something that looks a lot like one). Showcases are back and they’re some of the very best of the series so far. The Halo one will win hearts but I especially love the contest against the delta wing bomber, which is huge, fast, and looks breathtaking soaring so close to the ground. Bucket List challenges are gone, though they’ve been replaced by Horizon Stories, which are essentially the same events wrapped in a different context. One thread lets us loose as a movie stunt driver, while another sets us up with a YouTuber counting down her favourite racing games. This story, which overtly pays homage to the likes of Ridge Racer, Test Drive, Smuggler’s Run, and many more, is a pretty classy and unexpected in-game nod to some of the great racers that have ultimately inspired the Forza Horizon series. I do miss the old Bucket List style a little, though, as I did like running into random cars around the world (and also completing friends’ custom challenges). Horizon Blueprint is back, however, and you can create races in any season or time of day. This is a great way to dabble in seasons that may be several weeks away from occurring in the main game itself. You can also access Blueprint from the pause menu and play custom races on demand. Blueprint doesn’t feature a route creator yet but one is apparently on the way. Groove Music support is tragically gone following the death of the service, taking Horizon 3’s wonderful in-game OneDrive music support with it. The standalone app still works but it’s not quite the same. That’s the only terrible news in terms of audio, though, because the team have outdone themselves yet again. It’s all tremendous stuff, from the very subtle call of a crow in a quiet winter paddock to the monstrous anti-lag of an Escort Cosworth, which sounds like Satan choking on a popcorn maker.",

        "Title": "The Baconing Review",
        "Subtitle": "Not quite as tasty as the other white meat. ",
        "Subheader": "By Kristine Steimer Updated: May 4, 2012 4:25 pm Posted: Sep 2, 2011 12:21 am",
        "Content": "Despite the omission of DeathSpank's name from the title, The Baconing is very much a typical DeathSpank game. Besides the thong-wearing hero with a funny name, the action-adventure hybrid maintains the old formula of hack n' slash combat paired with puzzles and quests. This familiarity is both a good and bad thing, depending on your level of love for the franchise.  I loved the first DeathSpank , which was released a year ago. The unique art style, sense of humor and wacky characters captured my attention for hours on end. When DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue was announced and released a few months after the first, I fiddled with it for a couple hours before setting it down and forgetting about it completely.  Unfortunately, The Baconing had a similar effect on me. If I'd had a choice I would've stopped playing after a few hours. I don't want to paint the picture that it's a terrible game, but it certainly didn't grab me the way the first did.    Hacking away at piles upon piles of enemies is satisfying at first, but it can become a mindless endeavor. The team at HotHead tried to spice the combat formula up a bit by adding a couple new features, namely a shield and mounds of terrain for cover, but I was so used to playing it the old way that I didn't change my strategy up too much. That meant I died more often since I didn't hide behind my shield, but there's still not much penalty for dying so I didn't mind.  Like the other games, The Baconing's story is goofy: DeathSpank has claimed all the thongs of power, gets bored, puts them all on at once and then creates the AntiSpank (basically a really evil, robotic version of DeathSpank).  Before he can defeat it, he's told to burn the thongs one by one in the Fires of Bacon scattered around. Unfortunately, the entirety of the campaign feels more like a guided tour than an open world. You'll stick to a main path/area until you complete the task at hand (in this case, burning a thong in a bacon fire) and then move on. It's a very \"rinse, repeat\" style of gameplay, which I grew tired of.  Just like real bacon, behind the calories and fat there is some tasty goodness. The focus of this game is nabbing sweet loot, and there are lots of new weapons and armor sets to 'ooh' and 'ahh' at. The Weapons of Justice (basically souped up weapons with special power attacks) are pretty bad-ass, and include a dragon-assisted air assault and drills that pop up from the depths of the Earth to surprise your enemies.  There are five new effed up areas, including a twisted Disneyland rip-off, a retirement home for ancient Gods, a polluted lake and a leprechaun Las Vegas. They don't quite capture the magic of the first game's environments, but characters from the previous games make frequent cameos. HotHead's humor can also feel forced at times, for example, their depiction of Ganesha is more offensive than funny. I laughed out loud during the first game, but didn't at all during The Baconing.  This is a minor issue in the scheme of things, but the second to last boss in the game is one of the worst I've ever seen. You literally fight the same guy more than seven times, and the fight never evolves, it's the same every round. Not only did I want to throw my controller through the TV, I wanted to stop playing.  HotHead left two player co-op relatively untouched -- still offline only, you and the second player share a health bar. The new characters (Bob from Marketing and Tankko) are awesome, so it's a shame that most people won't be able to use them. Bob is a hammerhead shark in a business suit that shoots laser beams from his eyes and can dive underwater, while Tankko is a spider-human freak hybrid that can encase enemies in webs. In fact, they're more interesting than DeathSpank, so why aren't they starring in this game?",

        "Content": "I can typically play through shooters without missing the whole quicksave thing. Whether on PC or console, the Xbox-ification if you will of the FPS has made decent-to-good checkpointing de rigeur. It's not about skill (I think) -- modern shooters are just designed around the idea of paced encounters, and checkpoints work with that.  I quick-saved about 19 times in my first hour of Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter . That's a quick-save about every three minutes or so.    For many of you, I think that statement alone will explain whether The Second Encounter is a can of worms you want to open. For everyone else, let me be succinct: Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter is a relentless string of cheap shots, monster closets, instant deaths, bombastic weapons, and irreverently juvenile humor. Serious Sam is designed around ever escalating crescendos of over-the-top violence that will likely see you quicksaving mid-battle with the prescient expectation that a giant enemy will spring over that wall in the distance firing rockets that you couldn't possibly avoid in time that will kill you, instantly. If the idea of a die-rinse-repeat school of shooter design makes you want to hurt yourself, you can get off the Serious Sam train right now; if that sounds like a party to you, then read on.  The Second Encounter is, well, the second \"HD Remix\" remake using the Serious Engine 3, and given its nature as a $20.00 downloadable, it makes a decent enough impression visually. While levels are simple from a geometry perspective, they're huge, with atmospheric touches here and there. You can also pull out to third person, which can be quite useful. However, tilting the camera up exposes the limitations of this addition -- as much as two-thirds of my view was often obscured by tall grass or other bits of the environment. It does make the chainsaw more useful in more situations. PC players may have to consider when and where they use the third person view, as it appears to put a noticeable dent in framerates, though the game otherwise runs pretty well. At 2560 x 1600, my Core i7, Win7-64 system with dual GeForce GTX 260s managed to hit at or above 60 frames per second most of the time, and my home PC's aging 8800GT managed decent performance at 1920 x 1080 as well.  Unfortunately, the audio sounds even worse than its age would indicate. The Serious Sam property started as something between a budget and full retail title back in the early 00s, and strong sound design was never a priority. Full of stock sound effects straight from CD-ROM adventure titles almost a decade older than the original Second Encounter release, this HD remake might actually hurt your ears. It's even more unfortunate, then, that you absolutely need to hear what's going on in the game, given its propensity to spawn hordes of enemies upon even the most innocuous item pickup. It's all monster closets all the time in Serious Sam; you'll be more surprised when you're not ambushed than when you are. ",

        "Content": "Almost nothing moves on the Obra Dinn, but it’s still one of the most lively video game boats I’ve been on. Its crew may be long gone, but that doesn’t stop them from having interesting voices and complex stories to tell -- most of which involve horrific deaths. I’ve never played a game quite like Return of the Obra Dinn, but now that I have, all I want is more.  This investigative story skillfully straddles the line between an adventure game, a puzzle game, and a gruesome, supernatural, Moby Dick-themed version of Guess Who. At its core, it's a detective game, but you’re not out on a mission for justice or vengeance. You’re just an insurance evaluator whose job it is to assess the long-since-done damage of a merchant ship called the Obra Dinn, which has mysteriously reappeared after four years lost at sea.   Thankfully, that job is made a lot easier by a pocket watch that lets you view the exact moment somebody died, frozen in time. When you find a corpse aboard the ship, you can enter its memory and hear what that person heard for a few seconds before their death. Then there’s usually a bang or a crunch (or just one final exhale) and the grizzly moment of their doom snaps into view for you to explore and -- ideally -- piece together exactly what happened.  Return of the Obra Dinn doesn’t feel like the fake investigations of a game like The Witcher 3, instead empowering you to hunt for clues and answers like an actual detective. “  This is Return of the Obra Dinn’s main hook, and it’s one of the coolest mechanics I’ve seen in a long time. It doesn’t feel like the forced, fake investigation of games like The Witcher 3 or Marvel’s Spider-Man, instead empowering you to hunt for clues and answers that aren’t so obvious. You won’t find highlighted items or hints here, which makes Return of the Obra Dinn as challenging to take on as it is satisfying to complete.  Your overall goal is to fill out a book with the identities and ultimate fates of all of the Obra Dinn’s 60 passengers. Your book comes with a map of the ship, a manifest of names, and a sketch of everyone onboard, but you don’t start with any clue as to which name goes to which picture -- a daunting, but also extremely rewarding task. You can only figure out who is who by thinking critically and piecing together bits of information as you explore more death memories.  For example, you may hear one character refer to another by name, but it’s rarely that simple. Over the course of the roughly eight hours it took me to fill out my book, I used what accent people had, what type of hat or clothes they were wearing, where they died, the way others addressed them, the tasks they were doing, the people they were friends with, the bed they slept in, how their pictures were drawn, and a billion other little things to make the necessary connections.  14 Return of the Obra Dinn In-Game Screenshots 13 Images  Return of the Obra Dinn doesn’t teach you to use or look for any of that information, but it does do a great job of easing you into its tools and getting you motivated to hunt for the truth. Collecting nuggets of new info reminded me of a point-and-click adventure game, but instead of picking up various items that will inevitably be used in specific situations down the line, I was gathering tidbits about different characters that would hopefully help me solve more fates.  I had only guessed 15 of the 60 fates by the time I unlocked the last memory, but managed to solve the other 45 just by retracing my steps. “  As I unlocked more memories I started recognizing characters all over, giving me a clearer picture of who they were and how they might fit into the larger plot. I was stunned when I unlocked the final memory because I had only correctly identified 15 of the 60 fates by that point. But despite being given no new information, I was able to complete the last 45 just by revisiting memories and looking at events in a new, much more informed light.  I loved hunting for all the stuff I had missed, and I was shocked at just how much there was. Return of the Obra Dinn is so open-ended that it can be hard to understand what exactly you’re looking for at first, but I appreciate that it never felt like it was trying to trick me. That means if you see someone acting like the captain, they are probably the captain, not some seaman there just to throw you off. Honestly, it’s hard enough to fill out the book without any red herrings, which makes correctly putting the pieces together feel fair and well earned.  As those individual fates come together, the strange and enchanting story of what happened to the Obra Dinn comes into light. While there are 10 chapters to the book, you actually start by doing the final one and then jump around as you move backwards from there, and many of them are filled with delightful surprises. You often see the end of an individual scene first, then fill in gaps as you find more bodies -- and I enjoyed that there’s plenty that’s never explicitly explained or linked at all.   Return of the Obra Dinn is susceptible to a bit of brute force guessing here and there, but doing so always felt more tedious than just looking for clues like I was supposed to. Your guesses are only verified when you’ve put three correct fates in at once, preventing you from just trying every combination on a single name until you get it right without leaving you floundering in the dark hoping everything is going okay. It’s just the right amount of feedback.  The voice acting is exceptional, which let me rely on a character's intonation and expression as clues themselves. “  Some of the wording for the fates you choose from can be a little confusing, though. Parsing the difference between someone getting “speared” and “spiked” took just trying one to sort out, and at first I didn’t realize that “drowned” and “fell overboard” were two different things. But I really like that there are a wide variety of fates to pick from (many that aren’t used at all), even if that can complicate the very specific answers Return of the Obra Dinn is often looking for.  Confusion is also undoubtedly caused by the art style, which developer Lucas Pope describes as “1-bit.” There are only two colors on screen at any time and you can switch between a variety of pallets based on different classic computers. I really like the distinct and expressive nature of its low detail, “dithered” art style, but it does make everything harder to see. That can frustrate at times in a game about hunting for subtle clues, but I also love the flavor that comes along with it -- it’s not like a magical memory of a death from four years prior would be entirely clear.  That art is also coupled with some fantastic music and sound effects that make the Obra Dinn feel alive and full of character itself. The voice acting, of which there is a surprising amount, is also exceptional. It better be too, because I relied on the intonation, expression, and tone of different characters’ voices to help determine who they were way more than I was expecting. Something as blunt as an accent or as subtle as addressing another character as “sir” could help tell me whose fate I was exploring.  Every Color Palette in Return of the Obra Dinn 6 Images  I do wish Return of the Obra Dinn had made it just a little quicker to revisit previous memories, however. Your character moves fairly slow with no option to sprint, and you can only leave each memory by finding and exiting through a magic door, which can get a bit tedious. There’s also a ton of information to remember and sort through here, much of it qualitative and hard to categorize. But given the scope, your book does a remarkably good job of making all of that info digestible.  There are also a couple of tiny technical issues worth mentioning, but they’re far from deal breakers. Return of the Obra Dinn’s native resolution seems to be much smaller than 1080p, and while that doesn’t negatively impact its stylized visuals at all, it did cause my mouse sensitivity to skyrocket. You also can’t use ‘alt-tab’ to switch windows while it’s running, which made researching 19th-century naval hats online between memories more difficult.",

And I don't mean that purely in a masochistic way. I love a lot of difficult games, but what really sets this medieval colony builder apart is how its challenges all feel historical and authentic. And for a medieval history nerd like me, that really sells the experience – even when parts of it clearly necessitate the early access label. Farthest Frontier drops you into one of four pleasant-seeming biomes with a dozen weary settlers looking to make a new life for themselves. The basics of building and running a settlement are simple enough, and fairly familiar if you've played other survival city-builders: gather wood, build houses, find food, and defend yourself from wolves and bears. The really interesting wrinkle here is that all food eventually spoils. Even the stockpile you start with won't last much beyond the first winter, meaning you can't just harvest everything in sight and not have to worry about it for a long time. At least, not at first. Farthest Frontier Early Access Gameplay Screenshots 16 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask This simple change is the core of why Farthest Frontier feels so authentic, and why I found its challenges so novel and satisfying. It forced me to think more like the way an actual medieval, agricultural society would think, eventually leading me down a lot of the same paths they traveled in real life. There are interesting trade-offs at every step of the way. Grain can be stored a lot longer than other crops, but it also can't be eaten on its own – you need to turn it into flour, and then bread, which requires two extra buildings. It also depletes soil fertility a lot faster than other crops. That’s part of Farthest Frontier’s seriously detailed agriculture system. Every plot of land you can grow on has ratings for fertility, rocks, weeds, and even the ratio of sand to clay content. These can all be influenced with various jobs, and it makes crop rotation essential because planting the same thing over and over will often end up leaving the land barren after a while. I was actually looking up articles on medieval field rotation practices as I played, which is about as close to my personal happy place as I can get playing this type of game. Yeah, I know. I'm a dork. The Middle Ages wouldn't feel right without a healthy dose of suffering. “ You'll also have to deal with drought, frost, wild animals eating your crops, and diseases like mildew, the solutions to which make your settlement look and feel more believable over time. It's refreshing, honestly, when so many games have abstract mechanics that lead me to make silly decisions for the sake of getting things running smoothly. It can feel like a lot to manage sometimes, but I got into a headspace of embracing the chaos and sometimes even laughing at the misfortune of my villagers. Call me heartless, but it's the Middle Ages. It wouldn't feel right without a healthy dose of suffering. Sometimes, though, it can be vexing in less enjoyable ways. There's some sort of a built-in taxation system that's never explained that well. You generate gold from certain buildings, though it's unclear which ones unless you read all of the descriptions individually. Every year, some amount of gold is taken as a tax, without much explanation of why you're paying the amount you are. Some jobs also cost gold to maintain – notably the military. But even when I had no soldier jobs assigned and all my military buildings turned off, sometimes I'd be charged for them anyway, which was frustrating. It might just be a bug. This is early access after all. What's the best city builder game/series of the past 10 years? Tropico Frostpunk SimCity Cities: Skylines Anno Surviving Mars Other - Tell us in the comments Answer See Results I was glad I paid those soldiers when I did need them, however, because infrequent bandit raids can leave your homes in ruins and your stores of food and gold plundered. Walls and watchtowers help prevent this, though on default settings, I often found the amount I needed to spend to deal with attackers eventually became a bit absurd. Keeping a positive gold balance just didn't seem possible after a while, and I was only able to avoid bankruptcy by trading away luxury items every year. I feel like I'm missing some facet of how to manage the gold economy, but ages of poking through menus and reading tooltips didn't give me an answer. However, even in the worst-case scenario, bandits won't completely ruin your colony. It's always possible to bounce back, since new migrants will always be lining up to join you as long as you're keeping everyone relatively happy. So if the frustration of maintaining a large defensive force got to be too much, I could just ignore it and treat the bandits as another natural disaster I'd have to clean up after now and then. I really like the look of Farthest Frontier, too. It's realistic but saturated, readable but detailed. Zooming in on each little homestead reveals laundry hanging in the wind. Vibrant forests, fields, and rivers look like places I'd love to get lost in. And with the changing of the seasons, summer green gives way to autumnal orange and then the frosty, foreboding white of winter. The whole world feels so alive, which is something I was desperately missing in some similar games like Banished . One area I really hope gets tightened up during early access is performance. Once I got over 200 population, which is required to unlock the highest level of your town center, I started to notice some regular, though not constant, chugging and hitching, even on my Ryzen 7 3700X and GTX 3080 -powered system. Optimization is often one of the last things to get nailed down in an early access game, so I can mostly forgive it for now. But it does mean that my motivation to keep playing a bigger colony past a certain size started to take a dive along with my stable framerate.",

        "Title": "Samurai Shodown Review",
        "Subtitle": "A Slash From the Past.",
        "Subheader": "By Mitchell Saltzman Updated: Apr 28, 2020 10:20 pm Posted: Jun 24, 2019 1:00 pm",
        "Content": "While it may not be a household name like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, Samurai Shodown is a storied fighting game series with a legacy to uphold. The 2019 version, which is simply titled Samurai Shodown, does a great job of bringing its unique brand of methodical footsies-based 2D duels into this modern era of fighters.  Samurai Shodown finds itself on the fighting game spectrum somewhere in between Street Fighter and Divekick, meaning it’s not about combos, juggles, block strings, frame traps, or other high-level fighting game techniques. Instead, it strips all of that away, leaving a game that is laser focused on careful positioning, reading your opponent, and brutally punishing their mistakes.  This level of simplicity definitely has its appeal, and Samurai Shodown strikes a good balance between approachability and deeper mechanics that helps separate those who just mash special and heavy attacks from those who take the time to learn. Nuances like the best times to deflect, when to spot dodge, when to trigger rage explosions, when to use Lightning Blade attacks, and when to close your eyes, cross your fingers, and use a Darli Dagger punch to pull a victory out of thin air are all part of the mix.  Back to Basics  Despite the graphical facelift, not much has changed in the decade since the last Samurai Shodown with regards to the basics of combat. There’s a great and easily understandable logic behind each of Samurai Shodown’s four buttons: light attacks and kicks are quick and can interrupt slower attacks, medium attacks generally have long reach and can serve as great pokes in the neutral, and heavy attacks are huge, slow swings that deal appropriately massive damage but also come with a significant risk. Getting a heavy attack blocked generally means you’re open to eating a huge punish, but what’s wonderful about Samurai Shodown, is the fact that mind games are prevalent at just about every juncture.  As an example: Let's say my heavy just got blocked, which is typically very bad. But, if I predict that the opponent is going to retaliate with their own medium or heavy, I can use a deflect to cancel the block stun animation, knock the sword out of their hands, and score a counter for myself. On the other end of that though, if they predict I’m going to do deflect, instead of using a heavy strike, they can utilize a move that can’t be deflected, like their one-time-use super-special move and deal about 80% of my life as damage.  And that’s one of the things that makes Samurai Shodown so much fun. You get massively rewarded for good reads and massively punished for big mistakes, and while that’s true in other fighters too, it’s on another level here. There's an extraordinarily tense style of fighting that is unlike just about anything else in the genre.  There's an extraordinarily tense style of fighting that is unlike just about anything else in the genre “  There are a few elements on top of the four-button simplicity that add some extra depth. Returning from previous Samurai Shodowns is the rage gauge, which increases as you take damage or land well-timed “Just Guards.” Maxing it out increases the strength of your attacks for a short while and also gives you access to your weapon-flipping super-move, which not only does huge damage but also disarms your opponent, forcing them to scramble to pick their sword up off the ground. Alone, the rage gauge is a great comeback mechanic, but what makes it extra special is the ability to use a rage explosion at any time to instantly gain full rage and the ability to use the devastating lightning blade attack.  The trade-off is that once you trigger a rage explosion, you lose your rage gauge for the remainder of the match, which puts it in a good spot as a big risk vs reward trump card. My only issue with the whole system is that I wish the rage gauge had some sort of timer or something to let you know when it’s about to run out, because there’s nothing worse than having an opening for a weapon flipping super, inputting it, and then realizing that your rage had just expired.  If you get disarmed, you're at a huge disadvantage, but you're not completely helpless. Each character has a unique set of punches and kicks, with some characters even still having access to their command grabs even while weaponless. The coolest part about trying to fight while disarmed though, is when you're able to perform a deflect at just the right time to catch their sword with your bare hands, disarm them, and even the playing field.  The Seven Samurai… Plus Nine  Samurai Shodown’s cast of 16 wildly different characters is one of the best things it has going for it. Each one is brimming with personality, from the returning screen-filling Texan ninja, Earthquake, to the brand-new clumsy Chinese warrior Wu Ruixiang, who summons a dragon on accident for her super move and fumbles around looking for her glasses when she’s disarmed. It’s adorable.  There are a ton of interesting small details to each character as well. The seven-sword-wielding Yoshitora has a ridiculously overpowered special move that he can only use if he manages to land all six of his other special moves in a round; Nakoruru can hang on to her bird and freely fly around or shoot towards her opponent on a split-second’s notice; and then there’s the aforementioned Darli Dagger, who can deal 60 to 70% damage with an unarmed armored punch.   You can learn a little bit about each of these characters through a traditional, by which I mean outdated, story/arcade mode that gives each character an intro, a conversation between themselves and a rival character, and an ending – and that’s it. That may have been fine in 2005, but the bar has been raised for fighting game story modes since then, not only by big-budget games like Mortal Kombat and Injustice, but also by Guilty Gear Xrd, BlazBlue, and SoulCalibur 6. The worst part of it all, though, is the 30 seconds of a boring black loading screen that happens between each match. That’s far too long for a fighting game.  Hitting the Dojo  Along with Story Mode, Samurai Shodown’s set of modes is pretty standard. There’s a basic tutorial that teaches you about the various mechanics; a score-driven gauntlet, survival, and time-trial modes. There’s offline versus and online versus for both casual and ranked play, with the casual option sporting rooms for up to 10 players; and finally a Dojo mode that allows you to play against ghosts of other players, which are created based on their playstyle. Or at least, that’s the idea, but the reality is... not very impressive. I don’t know how many fights you need to play to really program your ghost to behave like a real person, but every ghost I’ve played essentially just jumped up and down, never approached, and utilized special moves seemingly at random.  I did get to test the netcode while playing against a buddy in casual play, and the results were remarkably smooth. However, the real test will be at launch when you’re able to match against all sorts of connections, so I’ll keep an eye out.   How's The Switch Version?  Updated February 25, 2020.  The Switch version of Samurai Shodown, which came out on February 25, 2020, is a completely respectable port. It plays smooth on both handheld and docked, and while it looks expectedly softer than its counterparts on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, its aesthetically pleasing art style still shines through. The one detriment to the Switch version is the fact that the load times are significantly longer on the Switch, which is a bit of a bummer, but it's not a dealbreaker by any stretch. ",

        "Content": "MOBAs are, by and large, hardcore PC games that require hundreds of hours of practice to master – but Awesomenauts Assemble! proves they don't have to be. This simpler, but still fun and competitive take borrows core ideas from the game type popularized by DOTA and League of Legends, like defensive towers, respawning NPC minions, and a cast of unique playable characters, and rolls them into a fast-paced platformer. It's something more than a “me too” game.  You might not guess, at a glance, that Awesomenauts is a MOBA, but the genre’s skeleton supports its gameplay. Pushing through waves of AI-controlled minions to destroy another team’s base works well with the compressed layout of the levels. The back-and-forth, offensive-to-defensive flow stays fast and fun when there aren’t huge, open spaces separating the vertically arranged “lanes.” Buying better items on any character is also easy thanks to a free skill that lets you teleport back to base. It’s not as deep as some other MOBAs, but the scaled-back size feels appropriate on a console.  The vertical level design also changes how combat unfolds, allowing for sneaky drops and quick escapes. Jumping and dropping between these lanes feels super quick and natural with a controller, and it’s more dynamic than most other MOBAs where movement is largely limitd by what items and skills you have  After you manage to knock down the first turrets, dying and respawning starts to feel tedious. You can teleport back to your base, but there’s no equivalent for getting back into the field. Prepare to spend a lot of time double jumping toward the front lines.  Awesomenauts’ simpler take on MOBA gameplay is appropriately paired with a light-hearted, silly style encompassing its art and sound. Lonestar, the drawl-talking, rocket boot-wearing sheriff, summons holographic bulls to push enemies away. A Soviet space monkey flies using a jetpack, plus he can slow time. There’s little consistency to be found between the dozen playable heroes, but each looks great in its own right, and their diverse skills make them all useful in different situations.  Sometimes it’s best to “push” a lane as quickly as possible. In that instance, the rampaging holographic bull is a fine choice. If enemies split up and try to push a few lanes on their own, the stealthy assassin character can pick them off. There are healers, tanky brawlers, and other classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to learn. Finding the ones that work best for you, and then rounding out your team with two other friends, is a lot of fun, and discovering different team compositions for different maps gives Awesomenauts longer legs. Awesomenauts definitely isn’t bad when played alone, but it’s best when played with friends. It allows three-player split screen on the PS4, both online and off. Awesomenauts Assemble! includes new characters and skins that weren't in the original 2012 release for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, but updated matchmaking is the only huge improvement. Matches connect quickly, whether queuing alone or with a team, and I never felt like my opponents were out of my league. Awesomenauts also lowers the ranking of players who abandon a game early, which is a good deterrent that keeps games from ending prematurely.",

        "Content": "Way back in 2004, when the PC game world was buzzing in anticipation of games like Half-Life 2 and Doom 3, Codemasters and 1C published an intriguing RTS called Perimeter that flew under the radar of many gamers. Perimeter was jam-packed with all sorts of cool ideas that bucked the traditional RTS formula; instead of trying to crush the enemy, you were simply trying to shape a landscape, an experience that looked very cool thanks to voxel technology that created incredibly original and dynamic worlds. While the game garnered respectable reviews, a common criticism was that it was a bit too complex and difficult for its own good. Unfortunately, it seems like the series has taken a huge step backward in an attempt to address those issues in Perimeter II: New Earth .  The first game dealt with the exodus of humanity from Earth, after the discovery of technology that allowed travel between dimensions. The problem was that this unleashed some kind of powerful, unstoppable foe called the Scourge that could assume the shape of our worst fears, as it was affected by our thoughts. Instead of blasting off into space, Battlestar Galactica-style, humanity locked itself into floating cities and then began jumping through different dimensions. Each dimension had a world that was shaped by human thoughts (there was even a pizza world), and the goal was to create a networked energy grid that allowed the floating city to move to the next dimensional portal. Along the way, you had to battle the Scourge using developed technologies and build units and defenses. The high-concept nature of the story drew comparisons to Solaris, the great work of Polish science fiction that dealt with similar themes.   Check out the shock wave. In Perimeter II, humanity has finally found a New Earth and settled it, but the bad news is that somewhere along the long journey it split into two warring factions, the Exodus and the Harkback. The thing is that they've become opposites of one another, right down to the terrain they prefer. The Exodus can only build on land, while the Harkback can only build on water. Thus, depending on the side you play as, you're looking to either raise the land or sink it. And despite being able to travel through dimensional space, it seems these factions have structures so fragile that if they get wet or if they're raised out of water they take damage. There you have the central crux of the game; you're trying to either stay dry or keep wet in each battle.  You do this by building energy cores that can either raise land or immerse it. However, a major feature of the first game has been done away with, as you no longer have to make sure that these energy cores network together to form a grid. That means you could plunk one down anywhere and it provides power for all those structures around it, but it makes Perimeter II feel much more like a generic RTS. In fact, gone is the idea of shepherding a huge floating city across the landscape; instead, you're back to the familiar RTS basics of building a base, researching technologies, and trying to wipe out the other team before they can wipe you out, which is a retreat from what made the first game stand out.  It seems like a lot of the cool ideas have been stripped out. Take for instance military units. In Perimeter, your units were fluid, in that they were a bit like the liquid terminator in Terminator 2. You might have a bunch of tiny units, but they could melt together and transform into fewer, but more powerful units. The amount of flexibility was considerable, and it let you adapt your strategies on the fly. Here, you can only build certain units with certain factories, but they can't merge together; they can merely transform between air and land states.   The Harkback like water. A lot. Perimeter II does add some powerful abilities that are customizable depending if you can discover and dig up special crystals from the ground. These abilities let you detonate a nuclear-type explosion that sends shock waves through the ground (a neat effect thanks to the voxel terrain) to cloaking your units to make them invisible. These abilities are upgradable, as well, so they can become overpowering. In fact, they are overpowering; I beat one mission in about ninety seconds by simply dropping an upgraded nuke on the enemy base. However, even the nuke missions can still be frustrating, even on easy difficulty. Once entrenched, the enemy can be as tough to kill as cockroaches; as soon as you destroy them, they begin to rebuild immediately. You have to pound them over and over and over again to fully knock them out. It gets tedious fast, and the AI doesn't really adapt well. It's just tough to kill.  Compounding this are other issues. The controls feel clumsy and the graphics have regressed; the once intricate and original structure designs have been replaced by blocky structures. The voxel-based environments are a lot more bland and generic. Yes, the original Perimeter had frame rate issues running on machines at the time, but there's no reason why a modern system couldn't handle it today. Even the interface design has gone backward; it's as barebones as can be. Then there's the story, which is told through electronically filtered voiceovers that could best be described as word salad. What was once high concept sci-fi feels like the tedious meanderings of a bunch of crazy people. And, finally, the multiplayer lacks a server browser, so unless you know the direct IP of someone else in the world who plays this game online (and good luck with that), you're out of luck.",

        "Title": "Madden NFL 24 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Out of contention.",
        "Subheader": "By Will Borger Updated: May 19, 2024 9:04 am Posted: Aug 23, 2023 2:12 am",
        "Content": "Madden NFL 24 reminds me of the Marvin Lewis-coached Bengals. Lewis led Cincinnati’s football team to the most wins of any coach in the history of the franchise, and they made the playoffs seven times during his tenure, including a stretch where they made the playoffs for five straight years. They never won any of those playoff games, though. Not one. Some of the losses were close. Some were heartbreakers that the Bengals gave away. Lewis’ teams were almost always good, or at least decent, but they were never good enough – and after a while it became clear that they never would be. Three years after his departure the Bengals would play in the Super Bowl, led by a new head coach in Zac Taylor and the recently drafted Joe Burrow. It’s amazing how quickly things can change in the NFL when organizations decide to try something new. Like Lewis’ Bengals, Madden NFL 24 is good, or at least decent, but never quite good enough to make it feel like a winning year for this series. After something of a soft reboot last year, Madden NFL 24 is focused mostly on refinement, while attempting to address several sore spots among fans in what has been widely referred to as a “make or break year.” And while several notable improvements have been made, it still feels like what the series has been known for in recent years: a great on-field experience desperately searching for a way to make everything else work. Unfortunately, while you can see flashes of greatness and the play is usually passable, it’s hard to shake the feeling that things won’t get meaningfully better until somebody at EA gives EA Tiburon the time and money to make some serious, meaningful changes. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Let’s start with the good stuff. One of the biggest improvements is to FieldSENSE, where the existing Hit Everything system has been combined with new animations that take player size and strength into account. EA Tiburon claims it has added or adjusted more than 1,700 tackle animations, and I believe it, because the new animations look fantastic. There are new contested-catch animations, wrap-up tackles, and my personal favorite, scoops, where large defensive players will pick up offensive players by the legs before slamming them back down to the field. Football is a violent sport, and the new animations depict that in ways that feel realistic. When a big hit happens on the field you feel it, just like you do when you see it during a game – just, you know, without the weird guilt about whether you should enjoy watching it or not. You get fewer of those “Oh, come on! You could have caught that!” moments. “ This year also brings improvements to the Skill-Based Passing system, adding new animations that better represent the scenarios players are in when catching passes. My favorites are the new diving catches, which look spectacular and make those seemingly out-of-reach balls more likely to be caught. It also means Madden NFL 24 is better at tracking player momentum, so hitting your receivers at the right point in their routes is more important – they need to have enough time to turn upfield or juke defenders. These are great changes; you get fewer of those “Oh, come on! You could have caught that !” moments, and plays just look and feel more authentic  when you see them executed. As an added bonus, more improvisational QBs – like cover star Josh Allen and everyone’s favorite Kermit the Frog impersonator, Patrick Mahomes – are more likely to use jumping and diving passes to make plays when the situation calls for it. Combine all of this with the redone player skeletons and player models that (almost, sorry Cam Heyward) always look like they’re stepped off the gridiron and onto your TV screen, and Madden NFL 24 is easily the best-looking and best-animated the series has ever been. It’s a genuinely impressive accomplishment, and it feels like you’re always on the verge of seeing something incredibly cool go down – just like the real NFL. What's this year's big game matchup? Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles Kansas City Chiefs vs. San Francisco 49ers Buffalo Bills vs. Philadelphia Eagles Buffalo Bills vs. San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Bengals vs. Philadelphia Eagles Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results This year’s edition also refines post-play reactions from players, and once again, they look excellent.  You’ll see them do kamehamehas, recreate the Spider-Man pointing meme, cheer, hang their heads, the whole nine yards. I’ve put nearly 40 hours into Madden NFL 24 since its release, and I’m still seeing new reactions. Refs are even back on the field this year (after being bizarrely absent for the last few) and we’ve got both male and female officials this time. Yes, there’s the odd janky animation when players collide, but they’re pretty rare. Madden NFL 24 absolutely nails the on-field presentation. EA has made noticeable improvements to the AI. “ EA has also made noticeable improvements to the AI, with the biggest probably being to AI blocking. Part of this is because of the expansion of the FieldSENSE animation system, which is being applied to blockers for the first time. Now, blockers are differentiated from one another and will make better decisions when blocking. That means more double-teams, more chip blocking, and more working together to push the pile, which in turn means a better experience in the run and passing game. This is one of those inside baseball (football?), under-the-hood changes that new and more casual players probably won’t notice, but if playing previous Madden games has ever had you screaming “why would you do that?” at your offensive line like I have, it’s an immediate improvement. It’s just one of the many revamps to Madden’s AI across the board. Another place you’re likely to notice it is against the AI quarterbacks, who will use more audibles and hot routes and play more like their real-life counterparts. That means that players like Patrick Mahomes are more likely to dial up big, highlight-reel-worthy plays in stressful situations, running QBs like Lamar Jackson will try to escape the pocket under pressure, and more cautious quarterbacks like Kirk Cousins will check the ball down. But it’s not just quarterbacks: run defenders will recognize if you call the same play several times and hit their gaps more quickly, secondaries will play short crosses and slants more aggressively and responsively, and running backs are better at finding holes, using cutback lanes, and navigating space. What We Said About Madden NFL 23 Madden fans will tell you that it hasn’t been a great decade for EA’s football sim. Like the NFL itself, the profits have continued to grow, but the product has suffered. Madden NFL 23, though, provides a glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel with a handful of smart enhancements to animations, AI, and passing mechanics that make subtle but meaningful improvements to the moment-to-moment football on the field. To be clear, Madden still has a long way to go to catch up with other sports sims, the majority of which are more refined, less buggy, and have a clearer identity. After playing Madden NFL 23, though, I finally have a little optimism that it’s on the right path — maybe not an emphatic “Boom!”, but clear forward progress for a series that so desperately needs it. – Kat Bailey, August 19, 2022 Score: 7 Read the full Madden NFL 23 review All of this adds up to a Madden where AI players are simultaneously much smarter, but also more capable of making plausible mistakes if that’s what their real-world counterparts would do. You’re more likely to see clutch big plays, goal line stands, breakout runs, and everything in between. It makes for a more exciting, more realistic game, and the best on-field experience I’ve had with Madden in several years. Note, though, these upgrades are almost all tied to the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC versions. If you’re playing on last-generation consoles, you’re out of luck. And then you get off the field, and that’s where things start to fall apart. “ And then you get off the field, and that’s where things start to fall apart. The first place you’ll notice this is in the menus, which are some of the laggiest I’ve ever seen in a video game. It’s not a problem everywhere – the main menu tends to work pretty well – but get into Ultimate Team or Superstar and things take absolutely forever to load. Even exiting a mode and choosing another one can take several seconds, which seems like way too long for this kind of thing. Madden NFL 24’s menus also have an input lag problem. Sometimes it takes several seconds for your selections to register… if they do at all. This means selecting the option you want multiple times, and in several cases, selecting something you don’t want by accident. This is a minor problem if you go into Ultimate Team when you wanted Franchise Mode, but it’s a real issue when it happens in-game and you call a play you didn’t mean to. It’s rarer when you’re on the field, but it does happen. Even if you’re just playing solo, it makes changing your lineup or opening packs in Ultimate Team a chore, and choosing your options in Superstar or Franchise mode take much longer than they should. Every IGN Madden NFL Game Review Ever 76 Images The problems persist when you finally get into the mode you want. One of the most touted additions to Madden NFL 24 is the return of minigames, which have been absent since Madden NFL 13. There are 26 minigames in total and they’re… fine. Some of them, like Rushing Attack, which charges you with taking control of a running back and scoring as many touchdowns as possible, are a lot of fun, and it’s easy to see why fans wanted it back. Others, like Backfield Survival, which adds obstacles on the field and asks you to run around the field for as long as possible without getting sacked, are goofy fun that help you build Stick skills. But a lot of them just feel pointless. Yeah, Passing Skeleton will teach you how to quickly identify the open receiver, but since the best way to win is to build your multiplier by completing passes, it quickly devolves into just throwing short passes. Target Passing, on the other hand, teaches you absolutely nothing and is absolutely maddening (no pun intended). The goal is to use your receivers to line up your throws to break targets scattered across the field, but even with the precision pass mechanic added last year, it feels more like a crapshoot than a test of actual skill. Worse, many of them are just variants that do things like add more defenders or put you at a different place on the field. Cull the variants and you’re down to just 15 unique minigames, and several of them wear out their welcome very quickly. I never wanted to play it again, but I didn’t have much choice. “ The real problem is that these min-games are now how you build player skills in Franchise, Training Camp, and Superstar modes. That would be fine if you could do them once and then keep re-using your highest score, as you could with older training options, but you can’t. If you want the full benefits you’ll have to play them every time. By the time I finished Superstar, I could do the Passing Skeleton mini-game in my sleep. I never wanted to play it again, but since the other options to level up my created QB were variants of Target Passing, a mini-game I hated, I didn’t have much choice if I wanted to level up at a decent rate. It sucked. Speaking of Superstar, it’s back as the replacement for Face of the Franchise and it’s also…fine. You can create a QB, HB, WR, LB, or CB, and guide them from the Combine – fairly generic mini-games you’ll play once and never see again – interview with teams, and get drafted. There’s a very simple storyline here, but nothing about it is as interesting as what Longshot or even Face of the Franchise did a few years ago. Madden NFL 24 - First Reveal Screenshots 9 Images The Combine is kind of fun, but it’s a one-off, and once you’re into the season it plays out as a fairly standard career mode where your character, the Madden Chosen One, tries to guide their franchise to the Super Bowl and earn the coveted Madden 99 Overall rating. It’s uninspired but fine, though it has its share of problems. Playing anything other than a QB means your career is often out of your control, and the whole thing is pretty generic. The most interesting thing in Superstar is Superstar Showdown, which replaces The Yard. Here, you can take your avatar online and compete in 3v3 and 6v6 games in an arena. It’s a neat novelty, but like all but a few of the minigames, it wears off fairly quickly. Other modes have seen updates, too. Franchise sees the return of Training Camp, which uses the minigames and lets you prep your team for the season. It’s a nice addition, but you only spend a little time in it each season. Otherwise, the additions are mostly quality-of-life changes – more trade slots, commissioner settings, coach talent trees, new relocation options, and so on – that don’t do much to address Franchise’s biggest problem: how barebones all of it feels due to the lack options enjoyed by the franchise modes in sports sims. Madden NFL 24 is much like Madden always is. “ Beyond that, Madden NFL 24 is much like Madden always is. There’s Ultimate Team, of course, and the combination of challenges, online play, and team building can be fun even if you don’t open your wallet the way you’re pushed to, quick play, the Pro Bowl (which is buried in quick play and easily missed), Madden’s excellent Skill Trainer, and so on. If you’ve played Madden in the past few years, you’ve seen it all before. And that’s Madden 24’s biggest flaw, really. Once you step off the field, it’s just plain dull. There’s a lot of good on-field additions this year, and the cross-platform implementation EA has added works wonderfully, as does the game’s netcode (I played a near-flawless game with someone on the other side of the US), but unless you’re in love with the act of playing Madden, there’s just not much here to reinvigorate it. Madden desperately, desperately needs a ground-up refresh, and you can tell EA Tiburon is trying, but the yearly nature of the series, and the sheer dominance of the money-printing Ultimate Team over everything else, means a lot of these changes are like putting a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound, especially when the UI is this painful to navigate.

The infamous card-collecting mode (pioneered by FIFA) has been a sore point with fans for years, especially now that the perception that it’s prioritized over traditional modes like Franchise have taken hold. Even so, its overwhelming popularity also makes it an unavoidable part of Madden’s culture. MUT has a bigger focus this year. It's still very much about grinding solo challenges, opening card packs, and acquiring awards to upgrade your players. There are two more seasons available, so it’s easier grind out a good team without spending money, and new players will probably have an easier time getting into it thanks to some streamlining. If you’re patient and dedicated, it’s not too hard to acquire a very good team through grinding, but of course the power curve tends to get out of control by the time the Super Bowl rolls around. And if you want to skip the grind, you can always spend money to get an advantage over your opponents. Because of course you can.",

        "Title": "Kill la Kill The Game: IF Review",
        "Subtitle": "Anime Mash-Up… Not in a fun way",
        "Subheader": "By Mike Epstein Updated: Apr 28, 2020 10:05 pm Posted: Jul 26, 2019 1:00 pm",
        "Content": "At first glance, Kill la Kill The Game: IF passes the fighting game smell test. With sharp cel-shaded cutscenes, including loving recreations of critical moments from the beloved Hiroyuki Imaishi anime series and the endorsement of its animation studio Trigger, developer APlus and publisher Arc System Works want you to see and get excited about the prospect of an authentic, official Kill la Kill game. Unfortunately, authenticity isn’t everything. Kill la Kill The Game: IF feels like a stripped-down version of the prototypical 3D anime fighter. Its loose, mashy fighting fails to create the opportunities for strategic depth I’ve come to expect in great fighting games. Meanwhile, its story and single-player modes feel less than substantial.  Kill la Kill The Game: IF is a fairly basic version of what we've seen in other 3D anime fighting games like Jump Force or the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm series. Unlike those games, Kill la Kill's matches are one-on-one duels, and take place on dull, flat arenas. The fighting is very simple, with each character using his or her own versions of the same three attacks: a close-range punch or strike, a chargeable long-distance projectile or dash attack, and a slow-moving heavy hit that breaks your opponent’s guard. Fighters also have flashy, powerful versions of each attack called deathblows, which are limited by a special meter. They do more damage, though not so much that pulling one off feels particularly satisfying, even if they come with a short cutscene intro to make them feel more epic.   Though the controls are simple, the characters attack styles are not completely identical. Certain characters have variations that may push you to approach a fight in specific, sometimes unintuitive ways. For example, Ira Gamagoori, a BDSM-inspired character who whips himself to build up power, takes a very small amount of damage when he blocks to build up his strength, which then makes his attacks more powerful. Other character’s eccentricities are much smaller - Uzu Sanageyama, the oversized, armored fighter with a wooden sword, has a charged version of his heavy attack that teleports directly behind his opponent. Unfortunately, there are no character-specific tutorials to help you learn each of their variations, so you will need to figure out how each character works through trial and error.  Though the attacks and fighting styles distinguish one character from another, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that you’re just mashing your way to victory. “  Though the attacks and fighting styles distinguish one character from another, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that you’re just mashing your way to victory. There’s a system in place where blocks beat attacks, guard breaks beat guards, and dodges beat guard breaks, but with an air dash that can reach your opponent from any distance and a lot of single-button combos, it still feels like just rushing in and mashing an attack button is the optimal strategy. You can spend half your special meter to burst out of combos using the Bloody Valor system, a mid-match minigame-style mechanic, but it doesn’t do a great job of teaching you this. If you don’t know it, or recently used Bloody Valor already, then trading strings of hits doesn’t feel particularly enthralling when dishing it out, and can be exasperating when you have to take it.  Bloody Valor is ostensibly a “comeback” tool, offering some recourse when you’re in a one-sided fight, but it does more harm than good. It's a rock-paper-scissors-style power-up mechanic, letting you spend half of your special meter to gamble for a battlefield advantage (such as healing your wounds or recharging your super meter) and raise your Ketsui level, which makes you generally more powerful. If you initiate Bloody Valor and win, you do it again to gain an even larger advantage. If you can win multiple challenges in a row, you’ll charge up a match-ending super move called a Lost Fiber Secret Art.   And if you start a Bloody Valor and lose? You lose a little health. There’s little incentive not to try it as often as possible, especially if you’re outmatched, which breaks up the flow of the fight in an unwelcome way. I’m not a fan of injecting random, tide-turning game mechanics into fighting games. Putting stat boosts and a match-winning attack at the end of a minigame separates the prospect of winning from your skill in combat, and undermines the fight as a whole.  The best defense may be Kill la Kill The Game: IF’s incomprehensible camera. Rather than following your character, the camera floats freely around the arena allowing your fighter to move out of focus or even all the way to the background, making it difficult to keep track of what you’re doing. There were times, particularly while playing the story mode, when I lost track of my fighter because the camera didn’t move as anticipated. There’s no auto-center button or way to turn the seemingly randomized camera off. You have to learn to go with the flow, which… I’d rather not. Fighting games are intense enough when you can keep track of the action.  Once upon a time at Honnouji Academy...  Despite being a fighting game, and therefore inherently multiplayer-focused, Kill la Kill The Game: IF puts single-player first. Its primary mode is its story-driven campaigns, a pair of abridged retellings of the original anime series’ final two-thirds -with some key differences that bring the playable fighters to blows in ways the original story wouldn’t allow. You should know right from the get-go: It’s all fan service, and you’re expected to know the whole Kill la Kill saga before you start, which makes sense for a tie-in game but feels limiting.   Though the campaigns are short - each one takes about three hours to complete - both feel like they drag on for far too long. The campaigns follow Satsuki Kiryuin and Ryuko Matoi, respectively, and are only ten fights apiece, including a mix of standard one-on-one matches, three-way duels, and brawler-esque engagements with dozens of generic “cover” opponents. The multi-character fights and brawls add some variety, but all three types are used repeatedly so they don’t feel especially refreshing by the end. Plus, that wayward camera has a tendency to make some of the fights borderline unreadable.  Long cutscenes separate each match, full of expository dialogue that rushes you through the plot. “  The real issue with the campaigns are the wait times between each fight. Long cutscenes separate each match, full of expository dialogue that rushes you through the plot. Though the cutscenes look good and are well shot, it doesn’t feel like much is happening if you know major plot points already, and isn’t effective storytelling if it’s new to you. Instead, the changes sprinkled throughout feel like they exist to facilitate fights, rather than make the story interesting in a new way.  The poor balance of cutscene to combat also seems to be in service of the story. During the campaigns, you’re restricted to the protagonists’ perspectives, to the point where you wind up watching fights take place in cutscenes rather than playing them yourself. In some cases, you watch multiple scenes and progress through entire chapters of the story without fighting at all.  Even if it weren’t mostly recounting events fans already know - key moments from the anime like the Naturals Election and the Great Culture and Sports Festival take up multiple chapters - the perpetual wait to pick up your controller and start playing tested my patience to the point where I wasn’t particularly interested in watching.  36 Images  While I didn’t love how long and redundant the cutscenes were, I will say there were very well made. Kill la Kill The Game: IF employs an elegant cel-shaded art style both in gameplay and cutscenes. It isn’t as inventive as the multi-faceted art style of the anime, but it’s clean, looks good, and really does feel like watching an anime in its rare, exciting moments. In cutscenes, the art gets an aesthetic boost from strong cinematography, which makes many sequences, especially action scenes, look striking.  But the story fails to give you additional insight into the characters or world of the anime series. Despite the fact that it was “supervised” by the Kill la Kill anime scriptwriter Kazuki Nakashima, giving it an air of canonical importance, IF's story bends over backwards to make sure you know that what happens is of absolutely no consequence to the story you already know.  The story is clearly the centerpiece of Kill la Kill The Game: IF, so much so that you are required to play at least some of it before doing anything else - the training and local versus modes only unlock after completing the first chapter. Online play isn’t available until after chapter six. I, and I think most fighting game fans would agree, that this is a cardinal sin. There will always be people who just want to jump into fighting with friends or simply don’t care about the campaign. Forcing you to consume even a small part of it feels, quite frankly, out of touch.   A Note On Online Play  Kill la Kill The Game: IF offers sturdy but sparse online support. Players have access to casual unranked play, which relies primarily on lobbies and trading codes to sync up with specific players. There’s also a ranked mode that uses more traditional matchmaking where your wins and losses get recorded on global leaderboards. Separating the different types of matchmaking feels needlessly restrictive and may make it harder for players to find matches one way or the other. On the plus side, in the five matches I was able to play on PlayStation 4 ahead of launch I experienced no serious lag or connection issues.   You'll also unlock new modes, various collectibles, and other characters as you progress, growing the paltry starting roster of six fighters to a still meager ten, including secondary versions of the two story protagonists. Two more characters are coming as free DLC later “this summer,” but even 12 characters feels light when the anime is jam-packed with weird, wonderful supporting characters who could add variety and personality to the lineup.  In addition to the story mode, Kill la Kill The Game: IF has a few extra single-player modes, including a training room, a single-player Survival Challenge mode where you continue fighting opponents until you die, and Covers Challenge, which is a wave-based brawler mode where you fight groups of generic enemies similar to some of the fights from the story campaigns. Though these modes present options to play solo using any fighter, including the more interesting characters not usable in the main campaigns, they lose their luster quickly with such a small roster.",

        "Content": "A detective, a robot, and a drag queen walk into a bar. That’s not the start of a joke, it’s an actual level in Murder by Numbers, a charming visual novel/mystery-puzzler that’s chock-full of charismatic characters and colorful locations. It may land just shy of reaching the admittedly high bars set by its inspirations, but I still had a great time solving this series of ‘90s-style whodunnits.  Screenshots from Murder by Numbers:  9 Images  Murder by Numbers’ premise can be quickly summed up as “Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney mixed with Picross,” and if you’re the kind of person who read that and immediately let out a thirsty “ Ooo, ” then chances are you can probably just stop reading now and buy this game. It accomplishes that simple brief with flying colors, to the point where I can easily recommend it for either of its parts, let alone the sum of them together.  Rise Like a Phoenix  You play as Honor, a TV actress unexpectedly thrust into life as a detective, accompanied by an adorable, scan-happy robot named SCOUT. Honor is an excellent protagonist: smart as a whip but a touch too overzealous for her own good. Watching her grow into a more confident person and adapt to an unexpected new profession as she helps solve a series of murders is genuinely rewarding. Meanwhile, the way in which SCOUT’s strange story unfurls is a little more hamfisted (it is a robot nonchalantly flying around Hollywood, after all), but their peppy and endearingly naive demeanor brings vital levity to some otherwise heavy scenarios.  All of Murder by Numbers is set during the ‘90s, and developer Mediatonic has done a fantastic job of capturing and then intentionally exaggerating the iconic look and feel of that decade. Neon colors and wild geometric patterns brighten every area you visit, even defining the style of its UI and menus. Be it a TV set, a fancy award show, or just Honor’s messy apartment, every location backdrop feels distinct and lively – despite actually being conspicuously devoid of any characters who aren’t taking part in the foreground conversation.  Characters are beaming with personality, and most are dressed like they could be walking down a Fashion Week runway that same day. “  Thankfully, the characters you interact with are also beaming with personality. Most of them – and there are quite a few – are dressed like they could be walking down a Fashion Week runway that same day, and I don’t think I saw a single character I didn’t love the look of. The character designs, both visually and how the roles they play are weaved into the story of each case to guide you along or throw you off the scent, are top notch.  That said, Murder by Numbers does make the somewhat tiring decision to have a majority of the people you interact with be strangely agitating. I know you’re investigating a murder, but so many of your conversations will either be angry, impatient, or flippant, often making SCOUT’s charming jokes an oasis of optimism in a dessert of negativity. There are certainly pleasant and empowering moments, but like in life, you gotta go through the lows before you make it to the highs.   Overcoming life’s lows is a running theme of the overall plot, a story that’s more mature than the generally lighthearted Phoenix Wright games. We join Honor at what is essentially the darkest point of her life and watch as she struggles to find her footing again – dealing with a shitty ex-husband, gaining confidence in a new job, and unpacking lots of well-traveled baggage. The smaller stories that make up each of Murder by Numbers’ four cases follow similar themes, intertwining with Honor’s journey while being independently entertaining (if somewhat predictable) mysteries to guess at as you interview suspects and gather evidence.  While the Phoenix Wright DNA is undeniably clear here, there’s certainly a lot less of its actual active crime-solving. The story is more on rails in Murder by Numbers, and your job is mostly to find evidence and show it to the right person to move that train along. It’s still fun, but you won’t be given those high-stakes opportunities to yell “OBJECTION!” in the same satisfying way, making most of the big revelations feel like the script’s instead of your own.  Grid Lock  Instead of cleverly connecting evidence, you’ll be doing some quite literal puzzle-solving in the form of Picross challenges. SCOUT will occasionally be given the option to scan for clues, which is a fairly uninteresting task that puts an ugly green filter over a location’s otherwise lovely backdrop and has you hunt for an arbitrary spot where your cross hair turns red. It’s a boring but mercifully short process, and finding something launches you into a Picross puzzle where the real fun begins.  Full disclosure: I flippin’ love Picross, and this is some good Picross. If you’re unaware, Picross is a visual puzzle in the same realm as Sudoku – you are given a grid with numbers on each line and have to use those numbers to fill in the grid and reveal an image – in this case, a piece of evidence SCOUT is scanning. That “scanning” flavor is really just an excuse to shoehorn in these puzzles, but it’s a cute excuse all the same.  Anyone who unironically loved the Sugar Rush theme song from Wreck-It Ralph will likely be obsessed with this soundtrack. “  While Murder by Numbers is missing a couple of the desirable features I’ve come to rely on from developer Jupiter’s best-in-class Picross S series (small things, like a timer or a way to easily count squares), it’s the closest competitor that I’ve played in terms of polish. It does a decent job of teaching newcomers as well, with plenty of helpful hint systems if you’re more interested in the story and want to breeze past the puzzles.  However, one area it absolutely surpasses Jupiter is music. The songs here are fantastic and varied enough to keep me listening for a long time – by contrast, I rarely play Jupiter’s Picross games without unplugging my headphones and listening to Spotify instead. The best way I can describe Murder by Numbers’ bubbly soundtrack is that anyone who unironically loved the Sugar Rush theme song from Wreck-It Ralph will likely be obsessed. I certainly am.   You’ll be listening to these songs a lot too, as there are dozens and dozens of puzzles to solve spread across the four cases and beyond – it took me about 15 hours to beat the story, though a few of those were spent doing optional puzzles as well. After an easier introduction, their difficulty stays in roughly the same neighborhood throughout too. Its 10x10 to 15x15 grid size range is the perfect sweet spot for providing puzzles that were big enough to make me think without ever threatening to stop me dead in my tracks when I was eager to continue the story.  On the flip side, if I just wanted to solve some Picross puzzles, progressing through the cases unlocks loads of optional ones in the main menu. I’d often dip into these when I needed a break from the dialogue, which made for a welcome retreat. However, unlocking them is strangely tied to a “score” for each case puzzle, which is basically determined by whether or not you use hints. I wish I could revisit specific case puzzles after finishing that case, or see any I may have missed within it, because otherwise unlocking the last of the optional puzzles means annoyingly replaying the entirety of that case.",

        "Content": "Kairosoft's pint-sized soccer management sim Pocket League Story gives gamers full control of a fledgling soccer club, and the tools needed to turn it into worldwide legend. Like all Kairosoft titles, Pocket League Story is a fantastic experience, but it lacks the depth of some of the company's best.  You'll have to buy the green grass for your own stadium.  It's up to you as general manager to turn a rec-league soccer team into World Champions within the game's eight-year time limit. Based on how well-trained your players are, how many sponsors you've accrued, and how many wins you've notched, at game's end you can set a new high score and adorn the title screen with a golden trophy.  During a match, you hold very little control over the outcome. You can tap a player to unleash their \"Aura\" at special times, but generally you're left gripping your device, passively watching the tiny drama play out before your eyes. A game between closely matched teams contains all the highs and lows of a real match, and some nail biters play out until the last second.  Like all Kairosoft titles, the fun comes not from directly controlling the action, but instead by successfully managing finances, research points, and other resources to create an efficient, goal-scoring machine.   Goal! Well, maybe. Research points come in four flavors: strength, tactical, idea, and hearts. These can be divvied up amongst players training, recruiting sponsors, and holding fan events. The quirk is, no matter how terrible your team fares, if you have the cash you can attract any superstar player to your team and any sponsor to your cause. In reality, while some Premier League teams might throw cash around in this manner, a losing team with only a few hundred fans shouldn't be able to attract a World Class superstar. This unbalances the game, most noticeably the second time through.  After your first playthrough, each character you've trained to higher levels keeps their stats – so you'll have the opportunity the second time around to nab cheap recruits who've retained their training. Thus, the second time around a lot of the challenge goes out the window -- think hat trick after hat trick for the duration of your team's career. It's fun to watch your team trounce their opponents 14-0 once or twice, but the overkill gets tiresome. While a few late-game matches provide a consistent challenge, Pocket League Story is too mindless after the first loop.  Kairosoft distills the sport into workable management by removing a few key aspects of the game, for better or worse. Elements like penalties or injuries would have helped the simulation feel more complete.",

        "Subheader": "By IGN Staff Updated: Nov 21, 2018 9:34 pm Posted: Jan 28, 1999 2:00 am",
        "Content": "Clutching a bit of hope from out a well of trepidation, our gamer approaches the package cautiously. He--and 90% of the time he is a he--opens the box, boldly emblazoned with the NASCAR logo. It's a pinball game! And not just a pinball game, but a NASCAR pinball game! Within is a CD, a 20-page manual tucked in the jewel case, while from out the denuded box tumbles a series of cardboard advertisements, hawking further wares. Flat out baffled by the use of the word \"Ultra\" in the title, and somewhat unsure what the term \"3D\" actually means in the context of a prone 2D pinball game, our gamer nonetheless installs the game, all 50 megabytes. And what does he find? Little pinball tables dressed up like NASCAR garages and tracks, as if this were some sort of racing game. Using the Windows palette and a few audio clips from TV, 3D Ultra NASCAR Pinball tries to recreate the Big Race, hopes to capture the essence of sitting in the grandstands under a hot, beating sun with thousands of shirtless fans swigging Old Milwaukee, cheering the logo-plastered cars as they whip by, lap after lap; the cars vibrating the very molecules of the air with the constant hum of their high performance engines, tingeing the fan's sweat with their reek of scorched tires and gasoline; and the fans, paper cups in hand, the reek of fuel oil in their nostrils, watch the race in beery somnolence, but secretly, secretly they wish for a spectacular end-over-end crash that sends tires flying and flames leaping in a fiery paroxysm of death and destruction; a primal carnage of twisted steel and crushed bodies... Well there is none of that here. This is a barebones pinball game with a bankable license. You get the logos of NASCAR, its drivers and its corporate sponsors, but nothing of its striving and thunder. One of the more deplorable trends in the game industry today (one of only many deplorable trends in the game industry today) is a pernicious little virus called cross marketing. This means to take a license, any license, and graft it upon something else, however inappropriate. This game performs this feat twice over. Once, by crossing pinball with stock cars. Twice, by letting the crass commercialism of stock car racing bleed over to the computer screen. NASCAR drivers must support their expensive hobby with blatant commercial advertisements, so that some of the most advanced cars on the planet are painted up likes boxes of McDonald's French Fries. And because this is a NASCAR game, Sierra saw fit to include the \"authentic\" NASCAR details, right down to odious advertisements for Corn Flakes and hamburgers. I am reminded of nothing so much as that old game show \"The Price is Right\", where commercial products like cake mix and car wax become the stars of the show. So next time, why should Sierra even bother with the trappings of the NASCAR drivers? Why not make a pinball game that is simply a series of corporate advertisements--begin by exploring the McDonald land table, advance to the bowl of Corn Flakes, finish up in Nike Town? But anyway. When stripped of its cross marketing trappings, when judged solely as a pinball game, 3-D Ultra NASCAR Pinball reveals itself as a mediocre, sub-par affair. But that's true of most pinball games on the market. Pinball, though but a little niche in the many-cornered world of PC gaming, is entirely owned by Empire's peerless Pro Pinball series. These wild-eyed fanatics know more of the history, physics, and appeal of pinball than anyone I've ever met. I had one of them talk to me about pinball until I was politely backing away, seeking an exit. To them, pinball is not some crude antecedent to videogames proper, an outdated telegraph to today's eventual telephone, but rather a cunning, crafty art in and of itself. None of that obsessive, passionate attention to detail manifests in Sierra's line of pinball games, and never has: like most of the other also-rans in pinball, the series is known for its mushy physics, flat presentation, fuzzy detail, and its failure to even employ basic tactics, like scrolling the screen. Picture a real pinball table in your mind. It is three or four times as long as it is wide! To recreate this on the computer screen, which is wider than it is tall, you must scroll the table! Otherwise, if you cram the whole table on one screen, you force the gamer to squint, as if he was playing pinball from twenty feet across the room. Certainly the ball mechanics, resolution, and customizability of the controls has been improved this time around, as this is the series' fourth outing, but overall the thing is still more reminiscent of some aging piece of shareware than something from one of the larger game publishers. Is there anything to like? Dated technology and nefarious ploys aside, the actual design itself is clever. First, you play a table in your \"garage\", where you must hit the ball against some particular spots in order to simulate \"fixing your brakes\" or \"inflating your tires\". Then you advance to the \"qualifying lap\"; the better you do the better your pole position in the ensuing big race. During the race, you are adjured to make certain plays--knock the ball into the First Lap gate, then sequentially into the Second Lap gate, etc., in order to move your \"car\" further up in the standings. This is mildly entertaining for a little while, but ends up feeling linear and restrictive. Not that it's bad to play with the design of pinball--certainly in a computer recreation, slavish simulation of something as essentially uninteresting as pinball is hardly mandatory; in fact it is good that the designer tries to have other, interesting things going on. But this particular game is too pat and timid, and its backbone--its physics and graphics--are so dated, that the entire outing drifts quickly out of memory. Cheapen the mix further with McMarketing, and the whole thing crumbles. It's certainly not worth $20, or your attention.  --Jason Bates",

        "Content": "Back in 2014, I reviewed Hatoful Boyfriend on PC and gave it an 8.0 (for \"Great\") for its ability to make its silly premise meaningful through strong writing and great characters. Here’s what I said then: \"Hatoful Boyfriend doesn’t pass up on the stereotypical male roles of a dating sim -- the shy guy, the playful bully, the best friend, and the popular guy, just to name a few -- but it pushes its characters past their stereotypes and led me to care and sympathize with each bird’s story. Surprisingly, it’s not awkward to date the birds. Better yet, the protagonist is just as interesting as the birds she pursues. As a self-proclaimed hunter-gatherer and the only human in the school, it’s fun to learn about her interests and personality as she interacts with the birds.\"  Above: Watch us play the PC version. While most of Hatoful Boyfriend remains the same as its PC original, the cross-buy enabled PS4 and Vita versions bring a funny new bird into the equation. Like the other eight dateable avians, the flamboyant golden pheasant Tohri Nishikikouji is well written and fun to interact with. Through Tohri we learn new information about Hatoful Boyfriend's most villainous partridge, doctor Shuu Iwamine. Tohri is out for revenge against Shuu for a past incident in a lab, and spends much of his time explaining his hatred for the doctor and comically plotting revenge with outrageous death rays. The pheasant is entertaining, but this new path is valuable because it, like the other paths, provides more context for Hatoful Boyfriend's surprisingly twisted world and further helps set the stage for the darker Bad Boys Love path. Note that the Vita version of Hatoful Boyfriend has some infrequent technical issues that aren't game-breaking, but certainly annoying. Every now and then music will turn into an annoying crackling sound, and some of the transitions between scenes will stutter while in the fast forward mode. These issues did not occur in the PS4 version. Both versions feature simple, easy-to-use controls. The Vita version does allow you to swipe through options with its touch screen, but ultimately it doesn’t make much of a difference. However, the cross-save feature is useful for jumping back and forth between the big screen and mobile play - being able to take my PS4 saves with me on the train is great.

        "Content": "2001 kicked off a new direction for the Mega Man franchise on Game Boy Advance.  Taking the roll of an action RPG – and one with a killer battle system and plenty of depth – Mega Man Battle Network wasn't the game diehard Mega fans wanted, but it was awesome nonetheless.  Fast-forward eight years and nine games later and the soul of Battle Network remains in the Mega Man Star Force series.  Now normally I wouldn't go all personal-like in a review – a game is what it is, and the reviewer shouldn't matter – but given the repetitive nature of the Battle Network/Star Force series it's worth a quick aside.  For those of you that love the series to death, or for anyone that hasn't experienced Battle Network before, Mega Man Star Force 3: Black Ace and Red Joker are going to be entertaining offerings that push serious depth in nearly every way possible.  For many people out there though – myself included, having dug the original three Battle Network games before stepping away due to repetition – the franchise just isn't moving fast enough, and Star Force's \"buy/don't buy\" is really a matter of just how much more Battle Network you can take.  The Star Force series picks up where the GBA franchise left off, replacing Lan with another kid (Geo Stellar) donning like-styled clothes, a snooty girl friend, an overweight buddy, and a slew of groupies from around school.  Mega Man.exe is replaced with Omega-Xis, an oddly bad-tempered alien, and rather than \"jacking\" into the net to solve problems the hunter team of Geo and Omega \"pulse\" in or out of the \"wave world.\"  Battle Chips are now cards, the wave world overlays on top of the real world rather than being an alternate highway of net-based paths, and turning into Mega Man can be done at any time by hitting the R button, though the same standard net-battle rules apply when it comes to virus busting.  That's just the start of a long list of repetitive \"other world\" changes that have been made when moving from Network to Star Force, and as far as game-to-game between the DS franchise goes you're getting the same world as the previous two Star Force offerings.  The odd thing is, even though Star Force 3 is nearly identical to the first two games – minus a few changes – and feels just like Battle Network did back in my old busting days (when hunters had to walk up hill both ways just to find a jack-in port; boy, you new-fangled youngsters have it made in the shade with that \"wave world\" thing – it's still a lot of fun, and extremely deep.  Making its debut this time around is a new noise system, which allows players to actually morph the look of Mega Man as battles rage on.  It's comes with a similar concept in mind as the Style, Soul Unison, and Cross systems that Capcom has used over the years, but it comes with varying results.  For every new touch screen design or 3D effect, there's a whole slew of old content and concepts.  Both versions of Star Force 3 are better and finding certain forms, and that ends up playing into what powers you'll get throughout the game.  Both Joker and Ace exclusive forms are pretty similar overall – if you want a huge explanation, you can find it on the amazingly populated fan forums out there – but the amount of grind that can come with busting specifically for more noise means added customization and depth to the game.  I've seen a fair share of gamers out there pissed that they can't get the form they want with the version they've got, but I took them as they came and enjoyed the amount of variation in the noise system.  It certainly varies things up for online play.  As for the rest of the core game though, it's another issue of \"more of the same\" for Capcom's RPG series.  You've got the same 3D battles when virus busting – which I have to say aren't quite as visually polished or generally appealing than the classic 2D version in Battle Network – more side quests and Elementary School fodder to deal with at the beginning, as well as the same overall pace and style in storytelling.  One minor annoyance I had with the original series was that there was an obvious beginning and end point to any actual scripted events – the game's story isn't actually real-time, but rather fades out from gameplay, fades in what is essentially a pre-made story sequence, and then fades back to gameplay again – is still alive and well, though I'm sure I'm in the minority when it comes to complaints based on that.  It just feels cheap though, and it's one of dozens of things still found in the Star Force/Battle Network formula that hasn't improved or evolved as the years go on.  I was 16 when the franchise started, and now nine years later it feels like I'm running through the same levels, fighting the same enemies, and doing the same quests I was while sneaking GBA time away in Biology class.  For those that are still very much into the series, however, Star Force 3 is going to bring just as many hours -if not more, now that the noise system has added considerable girth to the game - to a well-established, immersive experience.  The Wi-Fi is strong (though you'll need to deal with some random disconnections from sore losers ) there are plenty of side quests, 100 different forms within the noise system, a huge array of battle cards, and the continued use of the Brother Band system rewards players for connecting with friends locally or online; a nice touch for a series that is in desperate need of more innovation.

        "Content": "Rayman Origins is special, rare and precious. Somewhere in the last few years, the classic notion of games being benign and whimsical escapist fantasies was lost in favor of battered, war torn landscapes and desolate dystopian apocalypse. Vibrant worlds turned to rot and grit, smiles turned to screams, and it seemed that by and large, gaming  lost its innocence.  Is it possible for a game in this era to recapture the magic that inspired this industry to begin, while still proving itself a capable, full-fledged experience under modern scrutiny? In the case of Ubisoft's Rayman Origins, the answer is \"slapsolutely.\"    In many ways, what we have here is this generation's most artistically cohesive package, with perfectly imagined visual direction that never ceases to induce smiles. It's as if art director Michel Ancel drew a single, whimsical napkin sketch and then built an entire world around it, consistently expanding on but never once backing down from his original vision. Plant life unfurls around you, fiery pillars collapse, and avalanches give way to lush landscapes for your goofy characters to happily slap each other around. It's fantastic vibrant chaos that's exquisite on the eyes, with buttery smooth animation and a rock solid frame-rate.   There are moments of total madness where the background elements mesh with the foreground causing occasional confusion, but Rayman's biggest visionary downside is that it's almost distractingly beautiful. l want to stop to take it all in, but instead I hop and bop and collect everything I can in a mad dash to the goal. Luckily, most stages buck this trend by becoming more meticulously calculated affairs, where you (and some friends!) strategically grab Lums, (Rayman's answer to coins) and explore hidden corners of the worlds to conquer secret sub areas at your own pace.   Mosqheat-os!  There is never a shortage of people gathering around me to revel in how incredible Rayman looks on a nice television, and mastering stages in all their glory delivers a fluid, magnificent spectacle. Single player gets the job done and will absolutely satiate any cravings you have for an awesome and unique side-scrolling gaming experience, especially in the absence of a traditional 2D Mario title this year. But the real sweet spot here is grabbing two or three friends and just kicking some ass through these exuberant environments. You'll laugh, you'll curse each other out and you'll partake in some of the most fun local multiplayer action of this generation, hands down.  Rayman and his friends Globox and the Teensies don't rely on power-ups in the traditional sense here. Rather, each new world provides a new ability or attack to learn, and those moves stay with you forever, leaving plenty of opportunities to return to older stages and fly through them with more style and finesse. Each world offers plenty of insane locales. From the nightmarish cauldrons of pepper-obsessed chefs to the dark and murky underwater caverns brimming with vivid and ferocious sea life, there is plenty to see here. You'll take to the backs of giant mosquitos in ever-evolving side scrolling shooter stages as buzzing orchestras hum away. You'll swirl under oceans in the closest a video game has ever come to replicating the orchestrated synchronized swimming scenes in a Busby Berkeley film (Google it).  Experienced players will unlock unique treasure chest chase levels; non-stop \"screw up once and you're dead\" speed-runs that will test your dexterity and twitch reflexes as much as test they your patience. Rayman is tough, a near brutal challenge at times but it never fully inspires controller throwing, rage quitting anger thanks largely in part to its liberal use of checkpoints and its \"you're so damn lovable that I can't stay mad at you for long\" behavior. There are a few trial and error moments, but by and large this is a showcase of your own nimbleness, finesse and wit and it rewards your skills oh so handsomely.   Help your friends! Or just slap them.  Sadly, the past few years seem to have convinced some critics all that \"artsy\" platforming games ought to be short affairs, best suited  for the flimsy world of DLC. Rayman is much, much better than that.  There are a magnitude of stages to explore here, epic boss fights, unlockable character skins, hidden stages galore and hours upon hours of frantic fun. The notion that imaginative visuals and matinee-priced entry fees need be mutually exclusive is one Rayman Origins continues to dispel as hour after hour of gaming joy continue to ramp up in both sheer scope and in grand gratification. Rayman Origins takes on a genre mastery of ground work laid down decades ago and elevates it to astronomical new standards. It's a spectacular living painting that's as much fun to play as it is to look at, and it's a total triumph. Your move, video game industry. ",

        "Title": "The Surge: A Walk in the Park DLC Review",

        "Subheader": "By Jon Ryan Updated: Dec 6, 2017 1:57 pm Posted: Dec 5, 2017 4:03 am",
        "Content": "I mostly enjoyed my time with The Surge (read the full review ) when it came out back in May, and I’m glad to have an excuse to jump back into its bleak-yet-bright sci-fi world. While the A Walk in the Park DLC might not add much to or dramatically change up the gameplay, it offers more of the same solid combat and exploration in a colorfully creepy new setting. A Walk in the Park retroactively inserts its new area early into the existing storyline (near the beginning, so if you start a new campaign or New Game + you don’t have to go far to see it), essentially adding an optional six- to eight-hour side mission. Building on The Surge’s tale of robots run amok, it takes some cues from Westworld, The Simpsons, and Jurassic Park and sends you into Creo World, an oh-so-cleverly-named amusement park that serves as a “fun zone” for Creo’s employees. After the mysterious energy spike that caused all of Creo’s tech to go haywire, though, it’s now less “corporate funland” and more “everything-is-terrible-and-also-wanting-to-murder-you-land.” It includes all the staples of the Amusement Park From Hell­, from crashed (or crashing) roller coasters to robotic cartoon mascots hellbent on your destruction. Although these mascots aren’t especially funny parodies of lame corporate mascots (it didn’t feel like The Surge took the gag far enough) these big-headed doofuses provide some much-needed levity, which lightens the mood of an otherwise grim and straight-faced game. As was the case in the main campaign, the environmental design is particularly strong - even though I love them, the grisly renderings of how bad an amusement park accident can get had me wondering how willing I am to get onto a real-life roller coaster again. There are some clever funny yet creepy moments during the second half. “ Your objectives aren’t all that creative - it’s the usual turn on the power, locate survivors, etc - but there are some clever funny yet creepy moments during the second half of the expansion, such as when some of the AI-controlled attractions get a little too smart for their CPUs. The storytelling is easier to follow here because A Walk in the Park takes some time out of combat to relay it instead of trying to shout it over intense fighting like in the main campaign. The biggest change to moment-to-moment combat are the handful of new enemy types, in addition to bloodthirsty animatronics. While there weren’t any that really made me say “wow,” they helped keep me on my toes despite my familiarity with the solid combat system. Some possess new abilities, like the techno-zombified emergency responders that can self-heal, which help keep combat from getting old. I only wanted to change up my inventory once or twice. “ All of these new enemy types mean a wide variety of new armors and weapons to harvest, collect, and craft. Some are more ridiculous than others, like the mascot heads that you can make your own, but the others offer unique bonuses like additional item charges or bonus crushing damage. That said, all of A Walk in the Park’s new equipment has the same problem with being ineffectual as the main game’s set, which was made even worse because I was playing through on New Game + (as many of you may be if you’re coming back for more of The Surge). Most of these new items weren’t nearly as powerful as the gear I arrived in Creo World with, so they’re pretty useless unless you want to spend a few hours grinding for scrap and parts to upgrade them from their base level. I didn’t want to do that, meaning I only wanted to change up my inventory once or twice. Because the setting is so strong and the action holds up on a basic level, it’s not like these drawbacks ruined my experience. After riding all the rides and gorging myself on fried robot dough, it’s safe to say that a ticket to Creo World satisfies the urge for more bot-chopping action.",

        "Content": "I'm not sure I've seen a more original premise for a city builder than \"grow a frontier boomtown populated entirely by retrofuturistic steam-powered robots\" in a long time. That makes SteamWorld Build a refreshing drink of water in a trackless desert compared to the many, many trend-chasing builders we've seen over the last few years – and while you build a town above, it sets itself apart further by having you simultaneously excavate a mine below in search of both mineral resources and pieces of ancient technology that can be used to escape your dying planet. It's a short, sweet city builder that doesn't do too much new beyond that setup, but uses the parts it has to make a fun whole I know I'll revisit in the future. As has been the case for a decade, the SteamWorld games have a really well-established palette of character designs, colors, and even sounds to draw from. The result is a game world stylistically on par with much larger, more established franchises — like the Warcraft universe — that adapts really well to different genres without losing its visual distinction, personality, and setting. That’s still true in SteamWorld Build, where the goofily stylized robots that chug along to the same twangy country-western guitar tracks with the same silly voices are as charming as ever. It's a planet of steam-powered robots that all have accents like a Scandinavian person pretending to be from the old west, and by God does it still work here. SteamWorld Build Screenshots 9 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask SteamWorld Build's central rules are nothing new in a city builder. You provide citizens with services and produce goods, both of which let you eventually upgrade those same citizens to higher tiers – Settlers to Engineers to Aristobots to Scientists – and unlock new buildings that offer even more stuff for that next tier of bots. If you’re looking for a deep simulation of each citizen's needs, you won't find anything like that here, but the simplicity is a strength in its own ways. Fans of series like Anno will pretty quickly get what SteamWorld Build is doing and almost surely enjoy it, as will those like me who remember the older Impressions City Building series. Services are routed to your metallic folk through a basic system of distance: Everything moves over roads you’ll lay down, and any house in range of a service building immediately has access to it. Goods are produced at a specific rate, and you can stockpile some, but mostly you'll rely on having just as much coming in as going out, trading excess away at your town’s train station. There’s a simple yet satisfying loop as you expand both above and below. “ But it’s not entirely cut and dry, as your town simultaneously spreads underground. You’ll recruit miners, prospectors, and mechanics to excavate, extract, and improve your mining works. At first you’ll focus on finding easily-removed chunks of ore in dirt and rock, but later you have to supply expendable tools like pickaxes and drills to remove harder stone obstructions. And while the resources you find above initially support the mine works, eventually that flip-flops as the town needs the oil, water, and old tech you excavate below. There’s a simple yet satisfying loop as engineers from the town help you recruit mechanics to work underneath it, who then install and maintain auto-extracting machines on resource veins you find, growing your tunnels further so you can expand more, and faster, both above and below. What genre should SteamWorld do next? Top-Down Action Roguelike RTS 3D Platformer Fighting Game Story-Driven Walking Sim Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results You'll eventually need security bots to keep the underground works functional and safe from whatever monstrous bugs and ancient threats you might dig up. They’ll help protect your miners proactively, but you can also build traps and turrets to scare off enemies and defend your static base. It's a sort of Dungeon Keeper lite, where the threats generally aren't threats at all until you dig them up on purpose, letting you take on fights at your own pace – at least, at first. That's on top of a welcome range of difficulty settings that can make enemies anything from pushovers to a real, consistent threat. That’s a strong design decision for the kind of lowkey city builder SteamWorld Build is, where disruptive attacks could end up feeling more annoying than challenging. The fact that it uses enemies as speed bumps to smooth out the pace of progression instead of a constant gauntlet to worry about is nice. Upgrades aren't complex enough to provide diverse builds each run. “ As you dig and build, the train station aboveground also gets regular visits from out-of-towners. In classic old west fashion, this is a source of both money and things you can't otherwise make yourself: Building upgrades. Most buildings have an open slot or two to boost them, such as warehouses getting more storage space and workers to haul goods, resource producers getting a chance to make bonus items, or even just new picks and guns for the bots in the mines. You can also trade away excess goods for cash, which is nice. These upgrades are very simple, not complex enough to provide diverse build strategies to each new run, but they support your experience in a key way: If you don't enjoy figuring out ideal production rates, for example, you can just invest in bonus production and not think about your underperforming cactus juice farms ever again. From start to finish, it only took me about eight hours to build a town, excavate the mines, and construct a rocket to escape SteamWorld. This is a quick and simple city builder, which is both its greatest strength and what holds it back from being so much more. There are five maps with different terrain to work around, but the decisions you have to make while doing so aren’t otherwise going to change very much. You'll build the same stuff every time with little variation. Making your way through the production chain and exploring those maps is plenty of fun – but it's just the one kind of fun, not a deep and engaging puzzle that unfolds and draws you deeper over time. It does get a lot of beginner-friendliness and approachability from its decision to embrace simplicity. That's evident, for example, in the fact that developer The Station has actually managed to deliver competent controller support, unlike a lot of other city builders that only vaguely succeed at it.

Each map can be played with a randomly generated underground layer, which is a nice touch that keeps the mine-building fresh. Beating a map also unlocks a permanent upgrade to future towns' infrastructure, like a boosted train station that has shipments come more often. Nothing too special, but it is a bit of a victory lap that cuts down on busywork that'd be annoying to repeat. It's also a space-saving convenience that frees up time to make your towns pretty with decorations. Nothing like a neatly-appointed rail line to keep up steambot morale.",

        "Content": "Minecraft has become a phenomenon over the past five years, and now the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are some of the best places to play it. Though it may look primitive at a glance, your options in this virtual sandbox world are limited only by your imagination.  Cobbling together a first home out of dirt and stone feels great; building a castle with a moat, a dining hall, and a working underground rail system feels even greater. That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of exploring underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, tense, and one of gaming’s most expressive creative outlets.   Minecraft’s randomly generated worlds are composed of these big blocky cubes of dirt, stone, sand, and dozens of other materials. The blocks are colorful, distinct, and memorable thanks to simple but charming textures. What makes them great is how they enable creativity. Piece by piece you’ll rearrange and refine the pristine, primordial world into whatever you want. It could be a mountainside home, a huge tree house, a skyscraper, or any other creation you can envision. This is a power we rarely see in games, and the freedom it offers is, at first, daunting.  In Survival mode, each block must be chipped at and collected by hand from an open world. What initially feels like a tedious task becomes the basis for Minecraft’s rewarding core gameplay. I had to gather, transport, and place each piece of my home myself, so it was impossible not to feel a fierce sense of pride and ownership over it and all my other creations, big and small.  Land Grab  When the sun goes down, Minecraft’s bad guys come for you. They are scary and dangerous… for maybe an hour. Once you obtain the simple items needed to ward them off, they become almost completely non-threatening. This feels immediately disappointing. Why have enemies at all if they become laughable in no time?  But later, as my ambitions for building outgrew my resources on hand, my quest for new materials drove me deeper underground. Down there I realized those same enemies that are easy to defeat on the surface felt far more challenging to fight in the confines of a rocky corridor where they could ambush me. The amount of danger I was in was tied to how far from my base I roamed.  Losing everything I carried to a Creeper who got the drop on me was a heartbreaking lesson, but the excitement of exploring new places and the risk it entails provided a constant tension. All the while, gathering new blocks and items sent my mind reeling with more ideas for landscaping and home decoration.   Those goals don’t change when you bring friends in, but whether you’re cooperating or trying to outdo each other with larger, grander creations, having other people there makes Minecraft more rewarding. The PS4 and Xbox One versions of Minecraft allow two- to four-player split-screen play, and there’s an online mode that accommodates up to eight. Joining other people’s worlds is easy, too, thanks to a simple, easy-to-use lobby.  Unlike in the sometimes-cramped PS3 and 360 versions, the improved power of the new-generation consoles can handle vast worlds. They're 36 times larger, in fact, and there's plenty of room to spread out and build, even in a full eight-player game.  Learn a Craft  If you thought Minecraft was just about stacking blocks, the tutorial will wipe away that perception quickly. The quick and comprehensive introduction fully explains the basics of gathering, building, and crafting, and different stations around the tutorial world teach you how to enchant items, brew potions, start a garden, set up working electrical circuits, ride a boat, build golems, and more.  There’s a huge number of activities going on here.  The crafting interface conveniently includes recipes for every item, and it highlights the items you don’t yet have in your inventory. With dozens and dozens of combinations available, the built-in recipes keeps you playing rather than hunting through wiki guides and memorizing recipes.   Minecraft’s many items and systems are too numerous to list in entirety, but a few stand out. As you kill things and mine certain materials, you’ll earn experience orbs which can be spent on enchantments. It makes mining and fighting things faster, easier, and more fun. The same can be said for potions, which heal you, grant resistance to fire, and more. Light RPG elements like these add depth to Minecraft without bloating the interface with skill trees or stat screens.  Don't Suffer For Your Art  Under all that adventuring is Minecraft’s brilliant builder toy. Creative Mode basically enables all the cheat codes and lets you play with it freely, turning off monster damage, letting you fly, and giving you endless supplies of all the materials to build to your heart’s content. Without having to work and fight for them, my creations in this mode felt a little hollow. Still, Creative Mode is as much fun as a bottomless tub of LEGOs, and between the fun of flexing my own imagination and checking out the amazing projects other people have constructed, it’s full of possibilities.",

        "Content": "Hudson's My Aquarium 2 is the third virtual fishtank simulator to ship into the Wii Shop. The first was the original My Aquarium from two years ago. The second was Nintendo's first-party response, AquaSpace , that arrived less than a month ago. And, now, the third. Though it doesn't really matter which one you get, among this group. They're all pretty much the same.  Like My Aquarium 1 and AquaSpace before it, My Aquarium 2 gives you a handful of digital seascapes to shape and populate with various types of fish. You can change the lighting, the decorative objects, and the texture on the floors and backgrounds of each of eight different fishtanks. Then you can add and remove any combination of underwater wildlife you want -- even putting species together in the same tank that normally couldn't co-exist in the real world.  But, again, both of the previous WiiWare aquarium sims did the same thing. It's hard to figure out just what exactly makes this a \"sequel\" instead of just a rehash. Maybe the larger tank sizes? You can create some really vast, XXL aquariums this time around -- spaces large enough to keep massive creatures like whales inside, instead of being restricted to just the more reasonably sized species that could actually fit in your home. AquaSpace didn't have that, so that's something.  Even that feature feels held back, though, by the inclusion of several DLC packages that won't go live for several more months -- you won't have access to some of the coolest sealife and decorative objects unless you wait, and then pay more money to get them.",

        "Subheader": "By Leah B. Jackson Posted: Nov 23, 2013 3:11 am",
        "Content": "In Zoo Tycoon, nothing is more important than your animals. Whether you're simply watching an elegant giraffe leaning over a pool to drink water or marveling at the adorable baby elephants romping around, every species in this menagerie is delightful. But unlike the original Zoo Tycoon games for PC, the Xbox One version’s poorly laid out menus and worse Kinect functionality make them hard to enjoy.  You learn how to become a zookeeper through 10 in-depth training missions that clearly explain the most important aspects of the job – building exhibits and managing the layout – while not overwhelming you with details. This is where you learn to swap between the neat third-person exploration mode and the top-down Tycoon mode. It’s also the first time you get a taste of the inefficient menus you must consistently flip through to conduct zoo business, no matter which of the three modes you’re playing.  While menus are a consistent and important part of every sim, especially the older Zoo Tycoon games on PC, they’re poorly designed for the Xbox One. There are nice page-turning sound effects and some extra educational information, but that's where the praise ends.  For example, to keep your animals happy you’re required to place animal-care options like a feeder and bathing station in every exhibit, along with some enrichment options for them to play with. That nostalgic process is made harder than it needs to be by the cumbersome menu design, which makes it aggravating to move from one build option to another. There’s no option to build multiple instances of the same item either, so if you place one tree (or anything) and want to place a second, you’re forced to go back through the menus every time.  Building new locations automatically adds the most accessible paths for your guests to get there, which, while convenient, takes away some creative freedom. Considering I'm supposed to be making the zoo of my dreams, it's annoying that I’m unable to decorate how I please. Making sure all of your cute animals are happy is a perpetual priority, as is raising your zoo’s fame. Timed scenarios only give you 15 to 45 minutes to complete everything on a checklist, sometimes leaving little time to sit back and enjoy the exhibits you’ve built. Stopping to smell the roses once in a while might’ve made always having the same few objectives tacked on to otherwise-unique missions get repetitive a little less rapidly.  Yet it's research, which is undoubtedly important for real-life animal conservation efforts, that's the worst part of Zoo Tycoon. In Campaign and Challenge, you have to research just about everything, including animals, concessions, facilities, decorations, scenery, exhibits, all the way down to how you advertise your Zoo, before you can build or do it. Researching can take anywhere from five seconds to two minutes, but you never know how long until after you select it, and you can only ever research one thing at a time. Having to sit there and wait for a lion exhibit I want to finish researching so that I can research the lion, as well as all of the individual enrichments, one at a time, is a major frustration.  I expected Campaign Mode to roar louder than the other two, but its 20 levels all feel too similar to one another – and to the tutorial – and boredom sets in quickly. Their rewards are just as thin, with only a couple of decorations and a location to unlock for use in the other two modes. Challenge Mode tests your ability to make the most of your resources by plopping you in a location with a set budget, along with periodic objectives. But if you’ve ever balanced a checkbook, the difficulty here doesn’t live up to the mode’s name. Freeform Mode is the only place where Zoo Tycoon spreads its wings and refreshingly lets go of the confines of money and research. The only goals are to enjoy yourself, the animals, and build whatever you want at your own pace and progression comes at a rewarding pace.  Multiplayer allows you and up to three friends to work together in any of the three modes, but unless you’re using headsets it can be hard to coordinate. Everyone can contribute to tasks for completion, so getting objectives done is easier than ever. It’s also fun to ride around with friends in buggies in third-person view. But you can still only research one thing at a time which seems limiting when you have extra people waiting around for certain things to finish researching.  Again, though, it all comes back to the animals, and in theory, Kinect offers a whole new way to interact with them. They’re a disappointment. You can build three Kinect-capable interactions in your zoo, but they only work for specific animals. Feeding and washing animals with Kinect can be frustrating because the camera didn’t always pick up my movements, but the facial recognition is incredible when it works. While it can only be used with chimps and big cats, they can distinguish when you’re blinking or opening your mouth and mirror your actions. I loved playing with my baby chimps… but it’s always faster and easier to use the controller to manipulate the animals than Kinect.",

        "Content": "We love a good rhythm game. The Nintendo DS is perfect for the genre, and multiple games have already done well using a pretty simple formula of tapping in time with music. Perhaps trying to appeal to the rhythm impaired, or just the musically curious, Success developed Rhythm 'n Notes , an educational music program. Like a lot of education software, the title is not fun at all. Unfortunately, it's not even educational either.  Rhythm 'n Notes is hosted by a simple little cartoon girl named Tsumami. She's the obligatory character that all brain games also feel the need to have. She doesn't do much, but she is always there.  There are two parts to Rhythm 'n Notes: A rhythm section and a notes section. The game is split between these two categories, each with its own lesson sets. Players complete the lessons to move on to progressively more advance ones. No curveballs here. It's an educational tool.  What the game fails to do however, is make any attempt to actually educate the player. We started up the Notes section and it sent us to Chord Lesson 01. The game plays a chord, and then asks the player to identify it. Problem is: we haven't even heard the three different chords. How are we 'supposed to know if that was CEF or CBA?   Rhythm. Notes. Done. The game features a freeplay mode to players can listen to the chords before going into the test, but the game doesn't direct the player there first. Nor does Rhythm 'n Notes actually try to teach the player what their listening for. The differences between the chords are usually pretty subtle, since their in the same family. If this Tsumami chick that is hosts the game perhaps came in and told us the defining characteristics of each chord, so that we could listen for that slight rise in the end, or whatever, then maybe we wouldn't feel like idiots.  The biggest travesty is that the music quality is actually pretty poor. It would be perfectly fine for some other game's background music, but this is a game that is trying to teach the player to recognize notes and chords. It shouldn't sound like a Playskool Baby's First Keyboard.  Rhythm 'n Notes is also unforgiving in its difficulty. To progress at all, players have to score 100 percent on the lesson, then score 100 percent on a test right after (which is just the lesson, again.)  It took hours just to progress through a few lessons in the game, and we're fairly musically inclined. After making it through a few lessons we went back to the first one and found that we didn't even retain the knowledge of those chords. It takes all of our concentration just to focus on the three at hand, forget about learning them all.  The Rhythm section is the polar opposite, proving to be extremely easy. Players start off small, drumming simple 1/4 beats on a can, but move on to bigger, actual percussion pieces, like the timpani.  These lessons are far too basic to be any fun. And really, it's just the very basic mechanic behind DS rhythm games, which are already popular. Maybe if the Rhythm section had some songs, or made an effort to feel more like a game, it would be more fun. Elite Beat Agents will help players develop a sense of rhythm far better than this game will, plus it's a lot more fun and has real songs.",

        "Content": "Imagineer's last racer for N64, MRC offered a cool mixture of both off- and on-road racing. Unfortunately, the excellent track layouts and pleasing arcade physics were ultimately marred by three major flaws: The lack of tracks, blurry graphics, and a boring two-player mode. When we first heard about the semi-sequel, GT64 Championship Edition, and saw the first screen-shots, we were excited. Surely Imagineer had learned from its mistakes in MRC and would serve up a deep, challenging racer. Unfortunately, the truth is that GT64 is a worse game than MRC.  Gameplay GT 64 handles much differently from MRC. The steering and vehicle physics are more in tune with Sony's Grand Turismo . You won't be able to speed through tight turns without easing up on the gas pedal and strategically follow the (invisible) racing line. Players choose from 14 official GT racing teams with their fully licensed cars (Supra, NSX, and more). Before jumping into the races, you can tweak transmission, steering, brakes, tires, suspension, spoilers and the gear ratio. So far, so good But once you jump into the races, you will probably be appalled by what you see. You drive against seven other cars in the one-player mode, of which you will see a maximum of three on screen at the same time. The handling and car graphics aren't even all that bad ¿--but everything else is simply sub par. MRC was fun, right? But it was also dreadfully short. Three tracks simply won't last very long. So how many does GT64 have, a game released in late 1998? Three. To be fair, there is a short and a long version of each track (Japan, Europe, USA) -- but almost every other N64 racer has 10 or more tracks nowadays or at least offers different road conditions to make things more interesting. GT64 simply doesn't have what it takes in the gameplay department. Once you have driven each course once, it gets boring faster than staring into a tub of lard. It doesn't help that GT64's Championship Mode forces you to qualify for each race by driving a full three laps on the often over-long tracks in an attempt to prolong the play experience. Sorry, but racing three tracks alone on the same track over and over again before racing the same tracks for another three laps against a gang of lacking AI drones is not our idea of fun. The two-player (vs. only) mode is even worse, with slow controls and choppy framerates. No steering wheel support, either.  Graphics Some games have amazing music, causing the graphics engine to slow down a little. Other games draw tons of cars and track detail on screen which causes the engine to slow down. Some run in hi-res or feature specular highlighting, lots of alpha-channeled objects, reflection mapping or lightsourcing and in response run a little slower. GT64 has none of these features. Heck, it doesn't even have music during gameplay. We're still not sure why this game has such abysmal framerates, but trust us when we're saying that MRC runs a whole lot faster. To make things worse, GT64 is blurry and riddled with tons of pop-up and sloppily designed textures that don't quite line up. Weather conditions? Uh, sure. How about some grey fog? What a shame. The cars actually look quite good and the hood-view camera option is excellent.  Sound Bad music, but only during the menu and opening screens. As soon as the game starts, all you hear is the whining of the engines, which isn't even that great. Apart from that, there's tire screeching and the occasional \"tock\" if you hit an obstacle. GT64 will not be remembered for its sound either, that's for sure.",

        "Content": "You know, most \"party\" style games get a bad rap for not being Mario Party, but with good cause because rarely does a developer match the same level of fun in its own four player mini-game/board game design. Countless games such as Sonic Shuffle, Pac-Man Fever, even the original PlayStation Crash Bash tried the formula and, ultimately couldn't come up to the mark set by Nintendo's ever-moving series. The reason Crash Boom Bang ! sucks has nothing to do with any comparison to Nintendo's series. This DS game is just flat-out awful -- confusing design, boring mini-games, clunky controls, awkward animation. It's just terrible all the way through. And it isn't for a lack of trying, because Dimps clearly put some development effort into the package. It's just a bunch of bad ideas strung together with very little...no, scratch that, nothing good holding it together.  The concept behind Crash Boom Bang! is exactly what Mario Party is: a bunch of multiplayer mini-game challenges tied up with a dice-rolling board game. Players can either compete against other people who own the game, or battle against computer controlled opponents instead. But when you realize just how absolutely lame this game is in single player, it's not a very good advertisement to convince other player to put an investment down for their own copy.  First of all, the game simply drops you directly into the action and assumes you know what the hell's going on. This would be fine if it was a straightforward design, but since this board game is so convoluted with items and random events from the opposition, it does far more to confuse than to inform. Before you can roll the dice you have to look in your inventory where you can use an item...if you want to. The tutorial -- or lack thereof -- leads you to believe that you have to use these items, but the descriptions don't really tell you what they do or how to use them. What the hell's a tricycle for? Or a passport? Or a compass? Or a power crystal?  So this is all just confusion before the dice rolls for the first time. We then move into the actual control and action of the game -- the user interface is almost entirely touch screen driven, but the navigation is absolutely retarded and restrictive. And, for some odd reason, the one main control -- rolling the dice -- has to be performed by a button press. That might seem a little trivial, but when it's a game that's exclusively touch screen controls, that's just poor planning. But that simply personifies the entire package: poor planning.  Like any boardgame driven mini-game design, the spaces dictate the game to play. Land on a mini-game space and it's off to some random challenge -- and in this game, there are forty different designs. Honestly, I've seen more than a couple dozen of them and there's not a single \"gem\" in the bunch. Blow up a balloon up to a point before it bursts by huffing into the microphone. Catch falling wompa fruit by tapping the screen near its shadow. Put together a car using one of the most awkward controlling pick-up-and-drop-item interfaces ever conceived. Keep a feather floating in the air by, you guessed it, huffing into the microphone. Speed your giant sphere down a track in a sloppy trackball-controlling racer. All of them are dull, drab, pointless, and couldn't stand on their own as a \"fun\" DS challenge.  Sometimes you won't be involved in playing the game -- you'll play the part of the spectator. Here, you can take bets on who will win the game, and, theoretically, help your chosen \"horse\" or hurt that player's opponent by using the incredibly clunky and nearly broken chat program to send messages to them. What's really horrible about not being involved is that not only do you have to sit through boring challenges and wait for your turn, in single player you'll occasionally have to sit there are wait as the computer \"simulates\" the game unseen. I can certainly accept waiting in a multiplayer network, but when you simply have to sit around for the game to tally up computer opponent's score, emulating their competing with a \"Please Wait\" screen is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable.  And the fact that games can go on forever is simply terrible design. In the single player adventure you can only move on if you snag hidden tablets scattered under random spots that can only be collected if someone lands on that space. That particular game won't end until all of them have been found...and in one instance, a game went on for several hours before every one had been uncovered. Without the ability to save a game in progress hurts this production greatly especially when you have to play through all single player modes to unlock items. That is, if you really want these lame, boring games to play outside of the main adventure.",

        "Content": "Aside from a few minor tweaks and a new look, Metroid: Samus Returns doesn’t do anything new to the series; and that’s probably for the best. Metroid has made a few wrong turns since the Metroid Prime Trilogy, with sub-par spinoffs like Federation Force and disappointing games like Other M leaving fans like myself longing for a return to the Super Metroid-style 2D adventure. Samus Returns may technically be 3D, but its 2D platforming gameplay still looks and feels like classic Metroid, and it plays even better. This should sound familiar to Metroid Fans: In Samus Returns you explore a mesmerizing subterranean cavern with interconnecting passages that lead to dead ends as often as they lead to exciting new areas. As you explore, you upgrade your arsenal with mostly rehashed mods and beams from previous games that allow you to shoot new blocks, open special doors, or roll up ceilings, and jump over other physical obstacles. Eventually, those dead ends won’t seem so dead anymore – a satisfying feeling that became the foundation for an entire genre of map design, from Castlevania to Cave Story. And like the best Metroid games, there are no other characters and no dialogue in Samus Returns. It’s just a lady, an arm cannon, and a bounty, avoiding the pitfalls of adding other bounty hunters, space marines, and (ugh) father figures that only hurt otherwise-good Metroid games. (I’m looking at you, Adam.) In a year when Breath of the Wild so radically reimagined Zelda, it’s surprising to get such a formulaic Metroid adventure. It’s also surprisingly satisfying, while it lasts. I found myself wanting more, even though I’d just spent 13 hours 100-percenting it. That might’ve taken considerably longer, because Samus Returns has the biggest map of any Metroid outside of the Prime games, but probing every corner of it is made artificially easier with a new skill that reveals nearby rooms and secrets with the tap of a button. It’s basically a built-in cheat that I don’t recommend using your first time through. It might make Samus Returns friendlier for newcomers, but I relished the hours I spent poring over the maps of previous Metroids, and this feature sacrifices those moments at the altar of accessibility. Samus looks awesome, and 3D allows for much more detail in her movements. “ While 3D will never be as pretty as SNES-style sprites for me, I really came around on the 3D presentation. First of all, Samus looks awesome, and 3D allows for much more detail in her movements: She bends to fire down the barrel of her arm cannon and shoots over her shoulder like a badass. Second, each 2D space you move around in serves as a little window into a lush background that greatly adds to the atmosphere. Crystal caverns and rushing waterfalls glisten in the background, a large cavern opens to reveal a vast subterranean Chozo ruin, and creepy aliens laze about in the backgrounds of levels. The beauty of these backgrounds often encouraged me to turn on the 3D slider to get the full effect. I especially appreciated the glimpse into the ruins of the Chozo civilization, the bird people who raised Samus and who were instrumental in unleashing Metroids into the galaxy, sealing their civilization’s fate. You can also unlock 3D scenes of Chozo history, accessible in the main menu. Within the game, however, there’s little to absorb lore-wise. There’s no Prime-style scanning of hieroglyphs, let alone wildlife, and I miss the world-building detail of those prior Metroid adventures. A desperate counter can often mean the difference between life and death. “ In gameplay, Samus Returns distinguishes itself from the old-school Metroid games it pays homage to by adding some new moves, the coolest of which is a timed counter attack. It’s an acquired taste, because you have to come to a full stop to perform a counter; the beginning of Samus Returns has you do this a lot, slowing down the otherwise-blazing pace of the action. Luckily, deeper in the campaign your weapon upgrades allow you to slice through enemies quickly, leaving counter attacks as an optional way to grind for more Aeion (which recharges special abilities). In boss fights it becomes even more useful, and a desperate counter can often mean the difference between life and death. That’s where I learned to love the new move. One particularly large boss only offered the chance at a counter after a complicated series of dodges and attacks, making the fight almost Punch-Out!!-like in its complexity. Thanks to a few more subtle tweaks, Samus’ returning moves feel better than ever, as well. Shots are more precise when augmented by a new laser sight, she turns instantly in the air, and she can dash quickly through the levels, which are brilliantly designed to minimize time spent retreading old ground and maximize exploration. For example, an area filled with twisty little passages you navigate with careful bomb jumps early in the campaign can be utterly obliterated by a new weapon later, allowing you to just waltz through it. Every IGN Metroid Review 14 Images Like Metroid Prime, Samus Returns cleverly places equal focus on exploration and combat, though combat does tend to get a little repetitive. You’ll see the same ugly bug faces a lot, because your ultimate goal is to kill 40 Metroid minibosses to unlock all the areas. You fight the same boss a dozen times, and then a slightly bigger version a dozen more. However, later on the bosses not only get much bigger, but they also get varied behavior. You won’t only fight Metroids, either: One miniboss is cleverly hidden, and later on some of those beasts in the background come forward to cause trouble. The bosses get really hard – which I loved – but my long, repeated battles with some bosses raised a problem with Samus Returns’ controls. Samus’s complicated weapon options have you working the 3DS shoulder buttons, slider, and face buttons in a downright painful way. After a few tries at a tough boss, I had to put the 3DS down to rest. I’ve put in a lot of hours on 3DS games, including some tough ones, and Samus Returns ranks up there with Kid Icarus: Uprising as a top hand-cramper.",

        "Content": "Final Fantasy: Type-0 had me in tears after watching a chocobo bleed to death in the opening scene, and for the next 40 hours I would experience everything from sadness to disbelief as the thin but reverent story unfolded. During that same time, the zippy action-based combat made running around the world of Orience a lively experience, though viewed through an occasionally obstinate camera. Type-0 has a strange dichotomy of action and emotion, but it comes together to create a roleplaying game that works on multiple levels. Everything in Type-0 is tied to war, which makes for some intriguing presentation of the usual Final Fantasy features. Magic comes in the form of fire bombs, lightning missiles, and ice bullets, while the story progresses via military campaigns that involve liberating towns, defending bases, and invading cities. Even chocobos are bred for war; I liked that by capturing birds in the wild and correctly breeding them, you can hatch combat-ready chocobos that help fight in sorties, or can race across the world map to quickly arrive at a destination. The tale of an elite group of young cadets fighting an aggressive military empire serves as a reminder that it’s the young who die in war, and who are the first to be forgotten. Class Zero ’s emotional struggles – like watching friends die on the battlefield and then feeling guilty because they’re unable to remember them, is incredibly moving. Unfortunately, the cringe-worthy voice acting in the English-language version sometimes distracted from the solemnity, especially when the class loudmouth Nine kept adding “yo” and “hey” after every bloody sentence. Luckily, there are humorous moments sprinkled in to lighten the mood and keep the story from getting too dark; I laughed out loud when a saucy cadet named Carla sweet-talked a military instructor, then turned around to brag about her manipulation skills.  Campaigns that involve running through city streets or infiltrating fortresses were pretty fun, but I had a hard time with the real-time strategy missions that popped up here and there. I nearly rage quit one operation because the stubborn camera and clunky controls made it hard for me to move around the battlefield. These annoying mechanical issues were inherited from the original PSP version of Type-0 (which was released exclusively in Japan back in 2011), along with a few other noticeable limitations: NPCs have blocky faces, wall textures are blurred and jaggy, and dungeons and towns are little more than long, monochromatic corridors. I was so bored by most environments that I stopped caring about them halfway through the story. More Reviews Dec 6, 2017 Rocket League Review – Updated Dec 6, 2017 - What a save! What a save!

This is especially apparent in the central hub area of Akademia, where marble floors gleam with a fine polish, and beams of sunlight stream brightly through large glass windows.  CGI cutscenes are especially well done, with detailed animations of Eidolons soaring through the sky, and brutal close-ups of soldiers being slaughtered on the ground. Developer Hexa Drive did a great job bringing these powerful scenes to full-sized TV screens. Final Fantasy Type-0’s best feature, though, is the rapid, action-based combat that allows you to mix and match party members to create versatile three-man squads on the battlefield. Each member of Class Zero has their own distinct weapons, abilities, combat styles, and speeds, which makes them feel like real individuals: Jack is slow-moving but can easily slice through monsters with his sword, Seven can nimbly dodge enemy soldiers while using her chain whip to deal out vicious attacks, and Rem can use her Undying Wish spell to temporarily prevent cadets from falling on the battlefield. And if one of your team members does fall, you can immediately summon another cadet from Class Zero’s reserves to replace them, or call on a powerful Eidolon to help thin out enemy ranks. (Eidolons tend to be unwieldy, though, and require the sacrifice of one of your party members in order to summon them.) You can even request NPC support units from Akademia to help you on campaigns, which is a nice way to earn special points that can be used to acquire rare items. 38 Images Whether I was fighting mundane soldiers or taking on more exciting enemies like poison-spitting serpents and giant, angry snow beasts, I felt powerful because the combat was always super fast paced. In fact, many victories were achieved in less than a minute using the handy \"kill sight\" and \"break sight\" features, which allow cadets to heavily damage or even instantly kill an enemy with a well-timed attack.  Levelling up so many cadets in order to make sure they were all combat ready required a lot of patience, but I didn’t mind since Type-0 includes a nice array of ways to beef up your characters. You can accept side quests from NPCs, train at Akademia’s battle arena, increase magic skills by attending a lecture, participate in random battles on the world map, or re-do story campaigns accessed from the main menu. It may seem like it’s easy to overpower Class Zero, but almost everything you do is tied to the limited amount of free time you have between military campaigns. This clever bit of time management forced me to think carefully about which activities I participated in: did I want to spend two hours talking to an NPC, or leave Akademia and lose six hours so I could go on a monster hunt? Time was of the essence, and I enjoyed having to use it wisely. Finally, I had a little bit of an issue with the convoluted ending, which requires a second playthrough and a lot of reading up on Orience’s lore to fully comprehend. I didn’t mind relying on the in-game compendium for some things, but having to bend over backwards to understand what’s going on didn’t add anything to the story.",

        "Content": "A virtual dog or cat game? OK. Digital monsters or other kinds of fantasy creatures? Also fine. But when you get to the point where you're looking at, interacting with and taking care of simulated human babies, the concept behind the pet care genre begins to get just a bit too creepy.  A few months ago the DS saw the release of the first game to try that idea, with Ubisoft's Imagine: Babyz . And while the gameplay of that title fell short, the visual presentation at least kept things relatively comfortable by presenting its human children in a stylized, cartoony form. Baby Pals isn't so lucky. This second digital babysitting design on the DS is more playable than Ubisoft's product was, but it's also much more disturbing – its babies are meant to look realistic, but instead come across as vacant and eerie.  You won't want to spend too much time staring into his or her lifeless eyes, even when you're beginning the game and choosing, from a customization menu, what color those eyes should be. And what skin tone, head size and body dimensions they should have. You can make your pick of gender, too, though the choice seems to be mostly arbitrary – the selection doesn't affect the baby's body at all, only minor aspects of its face.  Gender issues are also where Baby Pals makes itself even more unappealing, and, worse, inappropriate, because two of the game's mini-game designs display your virtual child completely nude on the screen. Imagine: Babyz at least had the sense to obscure its babies' nether regions creatively to facilitate the inclusion of a diaper-changing mini-game design. But here, no such attempt is made – you're left with a completely exposed (though, thankfully, anatomically incorrect) child that's closest equivalent must be something like handing your son a naked Barbie doll.   Notice how no official screenshots were released of the diaper-changing or bath-taking mini-games. Yeah.  It's such a confusing and questionable inclusion that that element alone would give me pause in recommending Baby Pals to anyone. And there's an E rating on the box? Even more odd to make sense of.  The rest of the Baby Pals experience is more tame. You can, aside from playing the \"take a bath\" and \"change the diaper\" mini-games, also choose from a variety of other childcare activities. There's feeding. There's teaching. There's playing with toys, and there's lulling your baby to sleep.  Feeding plays out like a lite version of Cooking Mama or Imagine: Master Chef , in that you first prepare a variety of simple dishes like Pureed Bananas or Apple Rice Pudding by slicing, mixing and blending ingredients and then sit your kiddo down in a high chair to spoon it into their mouth. Ever played \"Airplane\" with a hungry baby that wasn't cooperating with your attempts to feed them? There you go. That's the idea.  Teaching is the way to make progress, of sorts, through the \"adventure\" of Baby Pals – most of the mode is locked in the beginning, but over time you're allowed to begin teaching your youngster to distinguish between different colors, crawl, walk, and the like. It's a fair design, too, though it may give you some trouble if you have difficulty distinguishing between different colors yourself.  Playing with toys is probably the most basic, as you just hold different objects in front of the kid and wait for him or her to grab at them. And you've got a patty cake design that plays out like a game of Simon, a simple implementation of Peek-a-boo that you can see a screen of up above, and a design wherein you guide little cartoon sheep through a garden in order to help your baby go to bed.  All of these elements together end up working well, and none are plagued with the touch screen unresponsiveness that the similar mini-games of Imagine: Babyz had.  So Baby Pals would be, overall, the more playable and less frustrating of the two.  But it really all comes back to the disturbing elements of presentation in the end, because they're unavoidable as you continue playing. Your baby has Needs meters, one of which is Cleanliness, so you'll be forced to play the mini-games featuring the disturbing, inappropriate nudity over and over again as you continue with the title. And those lifeless, ever-staring eyes never let up either – they pierce your very soul with their persistence, even popping back open immediately after a successful completion of the \"go to sleep\" mini-game. Disturbing, disturbing, disturbing.",

        "Content": "As a follow-up of sorts to last year's Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, developer Beenox brings us another dose of web-slinging action in the form of Spider-Man: Edge of Time for the Wii and 3DS. Though the game has some things going for it, it ultimately doesn't live up to its predecessor. If you're looking for the definitive Spider-Man experience, it seems you're going to have to hold out for a radioactive spider bite. Like most Spider-Man titles, Edge of Time largely centers around random bad guy beat-downs and loads of web slinging. Both are inherently fun, but both have been done better in the past. The swinging (which, let's be honest, is the main course when it comes to Spidey games) is fast, stylish, and elegant... until you encounter a wall. Walls are a tremendous pain for Spidey in this game. He has trouble interacting with them in various ways - crawling around corners pains him greatly and he awkwardly bounces off walls when swinging. It's weird, and takes away from these otherwise satisfying mechanics.  Prepare for Spider-Man action.  As for fighting, up close and ranged attacks are repetitive but fun to pull off. The new moves you learn along the way, however, are something of a disappointment. Honestly, Spider-Man had cooler moves at his disposal in some of his original PlayStation games - which is pretty pathetic when you think about it. The camera in Edge of Time is usually passable, but it occasionally twists around at inconvenient times and doesn't show the enemies you're trying to fight. Again, walls are a huge issue. When wall-crawling, the camera often goes berserk, appearing suddenly inside of Spider-Man, causing many of his polygons to pop in and out of existence. The sudden view change is completely disorienting. The 3DS version also suffers from the inability to use the D-pad and circle pad at the same time, making it hard to adjust the camera while moving. The pacing of Edge of Time is one of its strong points. While there are a ton of random beat 'em up segments, they're more engaging than you would expect from a title such as this. It also helps that they're broken up by lots of different activities that are all pushed along well by the storytelling.  You can do it, Spidey!  The story and voice acting are satisfactory at best. Nothing too spectacular here, though including some of the voices from old Spider-Man cartoons, as well as from past Spidey games, was a nice touch. The story is fun, but the time gimmick makes absolutely no sense. What happens in the future should never alter the past, but in this game it does. A small detail, but such little complaints add up and ultimately detract from an otherwise fitting narrative. One thing that separates the 3DS version from the Wii one is the dual screen functionality, but unfortunately this felt really rushed. At certain moments it concurrently shows both wall-crawler's points in time, but these parts are awkwardly choreographed, with one of the two Spideys just standing there not doing much of anything most of the time. It's a huge waste of the technology, and brings the whole presentation down.",

        "Content": "All right gang. It's time to put down the mouse, get up out of that chair, head down to your local videogame retailer, and finally put down the money for a NeoGeo Pocket Color. Once you wrap your paws around the system and give SNK vs. Capcom : Match of the Millenium a whirl, you'll finally experience why the system should co-exist with the dominating force that is the Game Boy Color. This is portable fighting at its finest.  Features   Fighter featuring characters from SNK and Capcom games  Dreamcast link compatible  Link-cable support for two players  For NeoGeo Pocket Color  Match of the Millenium is essentially a combination fighter, mixing two of the industries biggest 2D fighting champions in one single game. You want to know who's in the game? Here's the initial list:   There are other characters to uncover, but you've gotta find them first. And that's a lot of the fun right there. Don't expect much of a departure in terms of a fighting engine from the existing fighters on the system ¿ in fact, Match of the Millennium utilizes the same graphics engine as Fatal Fury , Samurai Shodown , and King of Fighters R2 . In other words, you're going to get super-deformed fighters, and a letterboxed arena (black bars cropping off the top and bottom of the playing field. It might sound like I'm slamming the game, but in reality these two elements work extremely well for the style of game Match of the Millenium offers. The black bars might be a programming cheat to get the game to flow smooth and fast, but they also make it easy to see the health bar at the top and the power bars the bottom. The super-deformed style also suits the game, since it's a fighter in pocket form ¿ besides, these characters have been squashed and squeezed before, whether it's from Super Puzzle Fighter or Pocket Fighters from Capcom, or the existing fighting games on the NeoGeo Pocket Color. In other words, goofy as it looks, the game feels very natural. This doesn't mean that the game looks just like the other fighters on the system. Not by a longshot. Existing SNK characters have been given an overhaul with somewhat more detail (they're slightly larger than their existing counterparts) and more frames of animation. The only real downside to the graphics is the fact that only one character, Zangief, has flesh-toned skin ¿ all the rest are as white as albinos. You can really see the sprite color limitation of the system in this game, since most characters only consist of four or less colors (white, black, and the occasional splash of detail). But the backgrounds and cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous and are dripping with vibrancy. You might remember a few backgrounds that have been given the handheld treatment, like Ryu's stage for example. And many backgrounds are also given life through a bit of animation, like candles flickering or the neon signs cycling through their lights. The minor details given are astounding. And the gameplay? Hoo, brother ¿ got a few hours? The game is basically broken down into two segments ¿ the fighting game, and the extras that append to the fighting game. The single player game is a multi-match fighting game that takes you through the game's silly storyline, and up to the fight against a mutant Ryu or Iori. Each character has his or her own rival that will jump in at the middle of the \"quest\" for a little one-match one-on-one (and that same character wraps up the storyline for each of the fighters..and trust me when I say that the tiny plots can get a little confusing). Fights can be the familiar best-of-three battles, a one-match brawl, a two-on-two tag-team battle where you can have either fighter jump in at any time, or a three-on-three team match. There are a few one-on-two and one-on-three bouts that show up in the one-player mode, but it's a set order and you'll know exactly when they show up after a couple plays through. At the end of the game, the computer will randomly punch out a number of squares from a nine-tile grid ¿ if you reveal the entire picture underneath, you earn that character. This is another clever way SNK gets gamers to keep playing its games ¿ the only way you're going to reveal these characters is if you keep playing. The fighting technique of the game is an amalgamation of moves from both SNK and Capcom, but the controls are very Capcom-esque. Because the NeoGeo only has two action buttons (an obvious design flaw right from the start ¿ especially when it's named after a console system with FOUR buttons), moves are sensitive to how long you hold the kick or punch button. The longer you hold it, the stronger (and slower) the move. This mimics the three punch/three kick buttons of the Capcom style fighter, and this has been moved somewhat to the SNK fighters as well. The only complaint comes from the cycloid controller on the system ¿ it's not easy to find the diagonals for the jump-in or out movement, since you have to guess where the midpoint contacts are on that joystick. You can also pull off power combo moves as you take on hits or you nail your opponent ¿ much like the Alpha combos of Street Fighter Alpha. The only thing I really miss is the icon that tells you how you KO'ed your opponent. The game also features an \"Olympic Mode.\" Here's where the game gets milked even further ¿ pick a team (SNK or Capcom) and compete in seven different events. Think you can go up against 100 one-round fights? How many opponents can you defeat in the 10-round, one-hit-KO challenge? How long will it take you to beat five opponents? There are also four unique mini-games that are tailored for the two teams ¿ the Capcom games feature a cool Ghost 'n Goblins task where you must hop back and forth grabbing treasure, and a Dance Dance Revolution style-challenge where you have Felicia groove to the rhythm. The SNK challenges put you in a Metal Slug mini-game where you try and take out alien UFOs (which really look like naked women's breasts...I'm not kidding), as well as the Samurai Shodown stage bonus where you hack down practice dummies in a dojo. These mini-games are small, but they add so much to the replay value of this fighting cartridge. More options means more play time. And just like almost EVERY NeoGeo Pocket Color game on the market, Match of the Millennium also features link-cable support. Two player matches are where it's at, folks. If this game doesn't make you try and find a buddy with a system, nothing will. You can create your own personal character (from the existing library of fighters, natch), and give that character his or her own specific win quote ¿ what a way to stick it to your buddy when you win...",

        "Content": "I never thought Smash Bros.’ intense four-player multiplayer battles needed more fighters, but eight-player brawls have become one of my favorite modes in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Eight-player battles are local-only,  which is an unfortunate limitation, but if you get a group of friends together you’ll fill these big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness happening in every corner. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing on a rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax that’s genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: it’s bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series. Smash Bros. Wii U wraps more than 30 years of gaming history together into an approachable brawler. Every fighter in the 49-strong roster uses the same button-presses to execute attacks and special moves, but each has their own distinct style that’s fun to learn. It makes them simple to pick up and play, but also challenging to master. Bowser, for example, uses burly strikes and kicks to pummel foes into submission, while Smash Bros. newcomer Duck Hunt uses a tricky move set of clay-pigeon projectiles, explosive barrels, and attacks that make playful references to the 8-bit era. Add in iconic characters like Mega Man, Samus Aran, Captain Falcon, Fox McCloud, Animal Crossing’s Villager, Pac-Man, Wii Fit Trainer, Link, Mario himself, and dozens of others, and you’ve got something for pretty much anybody who’s ever loved a video game. The attention to detail in every part of Super Smash Bros. is fantastic, and all of it is delivered at a speedy and smooth 60 frames per second. Mega Man walks using his signature awkward sideways-shuffle, and the new Mario Kart Circuit arena captures the zero-gravity look and feel of a Mario Kart 8 track. Items like the deadly Bullet Bill or POW Block stir up old-school Super Mario Bros. memories while also sending a satisfying wallop to opponents. With so many tiny details and references to observe, it’ll take lots of hours to see everything Smash Wii U has to offer. Excellent moment-to-moment combat is the real jewel of this game, and the many ways it can be played, from the Wii U GamePad to classic GameCube controllers with an adapter, make it a gift that keeps on giving. The action scales incredibly well: two-player duels are tense, while eight players all trying to Smash each other out of the ring is complete chaos. Turning items off removes the random element, turning it into more of a test of skill. But that’s just the beginning. The constant variety of the multiple modes keeps me playing. Event mode, for instance, makes learning new characters’ moves easy by putting them in playful solo or co-op adventures. One of these is “Keep ‘Em Off the Ship,” in which you play as Falco and go up to smash a squad of parachuting Mr. Game & Watch enemies out of the ring, and it provided me some great training for how to use the speedy character’s aerial attacks. The mission text makes some hilarious references to video game history, but the skills I picked up hold equal value, and the addition of two-player co-op makes it even more fun. Modes like Classic, Special Orders, and All-Star take a similar approach, using diverse matches, fun scenarios, and specific rules to set up creative encounters, but each allows you to choose the level of risk and reward. Special Orders allow you to spend accumulated Smash coins on special event matches, where winning unlocks another trophy or a handy piece of custom equipment; the higher the difficulty, the better the prizes. However, losing comes at a hefty price torching most (or in some cases all) of the stakes, giving these matches special tension. Nearly every mode of Super Smash Bros. offers a set of unlockable rewards, and the only parts about unlocking them that aren’t satisfying are the awkward menus and, more importantly, the stingy drop rates for custom special moves. Those swappable special moves alter the speed of Mario’s Fireball or the properties of other special attacks, so they’re pretty important and fun to mess with. The prospect of new custom equipment, special moves, beautifully rendered trophies, and more kept me playing for hours, even though Super Smash Bros. didn’t really give me enough direction for how to actually unlock the prizes I wanted. The only mode that’s a snooze is Smash Tour, which is effectively a mediocre virtual board game with too many boring parts. Four players take turns gathering up stat buffs, items, and characters in a build up to a final battle, which is a cool concept, but Smash Tour’s approach distills the essence of this amazing brawler game into painfully short matches full of random elements that just don’t have the same satisfying payoff or feeling of accomplishment. Super Smash Wii U’s online modes offer lots of match types to play with, from tense 1-on-1 showdowns without items, to 2v2 faceoffs in Team Smash, with up to two fighters playing from the same console. Just like in Mario Kart 8, getting friends together can be a little bit of a hassle involving text messages because Nintendo’s system doesn’t allow for notifications. But once you’re all set up, you can launch private matches with friends and unleash characters with customized movesets, or watch other players’ strategies through handy replay and spectator modes. Sadly, eight-player Smash doesn’t make the cut online, but four players is more than enough for a good brawl. This is also the first game to integrate with Nintendo’s new toys-to-life, called amiibo. There are no figures in the box, so this is an extra purchase, but if you do buy in they’ll add another, much smaller avenue of variety to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Computer-controlled figure players will stand in as opponents, and each one learns to defend itself as it levels over time. The investment required to reach max level is small (maybe three hours) and having a brutally tuned A.I. to unleash on your friends is fun to watch – but of course, sometimes my amiibo made some questionable decisions. I’ve seen my fully leveled Mario figure wreck opponents, but I’ve also watched in horror as it totally gave away the match. I’m proud of my amiibo, but sometimes it’s like dealing with a child that only listens half the time. title=More%20Reviews%20On%20IGN&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=review-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article",

        "Content": "After over a month on the market the N-Gage finally has its first sports title: MLB Slam ! The new baseball title features five single player modes including an expansive 162 game season mode, wireless two-player gaming, and the complete roster of MLB players with current stats. Developer Hexacto Games has attempted to include multiple game modes and extras to make a well-rounded portable baseball experience, but despite of all the bells and whistles MLB Slam! suffers from dull and unintuitive gameplay that will fail to please all but the most desperate of N-Gage sports fanatics.  Features  Five single player modes Two-player wireless multiplayer Full roster of MLB players Current player stats Dream Team creation mode  Whether you pick Quick Match, Spring Training, Full Season, Post Season, or Homerun Derby, the only thing that really changes are the teams and the number of games. You are still left with a very stripped-down pitch and hit game where the outfield and base running are left almost entirely under the control of the computer. While there are a handful of pitching styles intended to keep your opponent guessing, the computer hits or misses at random, making the task of choosing a slider, curveball, or fastball unnecessary. We were able to win entire games without ever changing the speed or style of our pitch. Needless to say this results in an extremely tedious time at the pitcher's mound. Once the computer makes a hit the player's role in the game diminishes even further, and your closest outfielder automatically runs after and often catches the ball for you. All that's left up to the player is to choose which base to throw to. Things get a little more interesting at the batting plate. Connecting with the ball is a simple matter of lining up a curser with the pitch. By pressing the 8 button you can put more power behind your swing, but as a result your swing curser becomes smaller and more difficult to line up with the ball. Paying attention to the batter's stats comes in handy, as attempting power hits with lesser skilled players can be disastrous. Relying on your reflexes and staying aware of your batter's abilities are the most engaging aspects of MLB Slam! Unfortunately the fun stops there and the computer takes control of the base running. Full Season mode will take you through the entirety of a MLB season, including inter-league and post season games. You can play a season with your favorite MLB teams, or with your own handpicked roster in Dream Team mode. Dream Team is a fairly simple recruit-and-trade mode that makes season games a little more interesting by putting money and player value on the line. While the N-Gage is supposed to represent a technological leap in graphics for portables, MLB Slam! is a stumble backwards. Extremely simplified character models, static, flat looking stadium environments, and choppy animations are reminiscent of the ancient days of 8-bit gaming. Camera perspectives are limited to two basic views--behind the batter and a top-down view of the field. The top-down perspective also has a major flaw; there are no icons to indicate player positions when they escape the view of the camera. Multiple times we found ourselves starring at a solitary ball, not knowing where the off-screen players where or which direction to press to run and retrieve it, turning a simple error into a helpless situation. Umpire calls, bat cracks and crowd cheers make up most of the audio effects in MLB Slam! There is no music, commentators, or classic baseball organ tunes blaring across the stadium (probably for the better). Overall sound design conforms with the rest of the game in being barely average, and won't be missed if you play without it.",

        "Content": "I wanted to love Test Drive Unlimited 2 . I really did. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. Doesn't it all sound fantastic? The ideas that went into Test Drive Unlimited 2 are appealing in every way, but the execution is completely off. This open-world driving experience is riddled with problems and even the driving itself is far from perfect.  At the start of Test Drive, you're a down-on-your-luck valet who just got fired for sleeping on the job. But for some reason, the rich gal who got you fired decides to hire you as a temporary chauffer. Her wager: if you get her to a studio taping she has to attend, you can enter Solar Crown -- a luxurious racing competition that takes place across Ibiza.  Spoilers: you enter the competition and join the ranks of the Solar Crown pro racers. Go you!    These opening cutscenes serve two purposes: they introduce you to Test Drive's story, and they illustrate just how atrocious the character models are. Although driving is the most important aspect of Test Drive, the characters look and animate poorly. These antiquated models \"come to life\" with some bad voice acting, too. The voice clips will annoy at first and then grow to intolerable levels as they're repeated constantly.  Ugly character models and bad voice acting are just a few of the many shortcomings found in Test Drive Unlimited 2. It crashed when I tried to change the paint job in my new apartment. Environments popped-in when I drove across the island. My car has quite literally dropped into the ocean when I was nowhere near water. There isn't even a camera invert option for wandering around in the first-person view.  If you're the kind of gamer who can tolerate such issues, you'll be more likely to appreciate the ideas in Test Drive. You can drive almost anywhere in Ibiza, buy and customize new cars, help random strangers for cash, and interact with other players cruising around the island. As you play, you level up meters that gauge your progression in four separate categories: Competition, Discovery, Collection, and Social. Leveling these aspects of your character enhances your Global level, and earning new levels unlocks new content in the game like avatar customization options, car upgrades, and more.  But this freedom to explore and enjoy Ibiza (and later Hawaii) is limited. Drive to a remote corner of the island, and you often can't do anything once you get there. Your character can only leave the car at predetermined points, and there's no environmental interaction or objectives besides taking photographs and finding hidden car wrecks. With such a massive island to explore, I wish there was more I could do on it.  When it comes to the actual driving, there are just as many conflicting issues. I respect the game's attempt to bridge the gap between arcade-style racing and realistic simulation controls. But ultimately the cars in Test Drive lack the visceral quality that real vehicles possess. I didn't feel like I was driving a powerful machine; I felt like I was controlling a toy.  Gameplay problems aside, there are technical issues that spoiled my experience. There were several occasions where, at the start of a single-player race, my opponents would suddenly spawn ahead of my car and speed off. I'd call that an unfair advantage. I was also frustrated with how Test Drive handles the \"return to road\" feature that can be activated if you find yourself too far off course. I've missed critical checkpoints thanks to that feature.   Check our media gallery for more screenshots of Test Drive Unlimited 2.  Not all is without hope. Test Drive Unlimited 2's multiplayer functionality is intriguing and, when it works, fun. At one point as I drove through a city I saw a small group of players (all sporting supercars) driving around together. That's awesome. I also appreciate the ability to instantly challenge any player just by flashing my lights at them. You can even bet your own virtual money on the outcome.  The problem here is that the Test Drive servers have been problematic since launch. All three versions of the game seem to be experiencing issues, which is disappointing. The online stability could improve with patching, but my heart goes out to the folks who were ready to play right after launch and couldn't.  \"It's a shame\" should be the motto for Test Drive Unlimited 2. On paper, this is the kind of experience I'd love to play. The amount of road to explore and the amount of competitions to enter make me froth at the mouth. But the awful characters, bland driving and the general lack of polish keep Test Drive from being the definitive \"racer-lifestyle emulator\" it set out to be.",

        "Content": "I don't even know where to begin.  I've played many video games in my time, across numerous platforms.  From NES to the new Nintendo Wii, from Intellivision to Xbox 360 - and I can say without exaggeration, that this is one of the worst games I've ever played.  Everything about it screams \"I'm under a deadline!  I really need at least 3 months to write the script, debug the code, render beautiful art, and record inspired voice work.  But you know what?  My kid has really been nagging me to play catch with him.  Let's just wrap up the whole development cycle sometime this weekend.  Is that good for you folks?\"  And undoubtedly the collective response from the entire development team of two people and a monkey would be a mixture of various grunts and applause in affirmation.   Set in the small fictional country of Palinero, Brigade E5 forces players to create a squad of mercenaries to keep the country from falling into the depths of a civil war, and ideally keep everyone from killing each other and destroying all the ugly buildings.  The player is afforded the opportunity to experience the game from three differing viewpoints of the civil strife.  The developers, Aperion, decided to implement an \"innovative\" combat system called Smart Pause Mode, whereupon the action is abruptly halted when the player must make some sort of tactical decision.  Not only is this jarring to the action, but it also seems completely arbitrary when the game chooses to \"smart\"-ly pause.  One of your mercs might be in the midst of firing off one of the game's many weapons, only for the game to pause four rounds into a clip.  The game starts off somewhat promisingly through its pre-rendered introductory movies.  It appears as if the developers have put some thought into the background story and have every intention of immersing players into a fiction, beautifully realized world.  Boy was that na¿ve.  The moment the animated characters open their mouths, you're treated to a lackluster display of voice-acting talent.  I could honestly visualize in my head the voice actors' darting eyes as they held the script in one hand, and reached for the door to the hallway with the other.  This is typical of the game, the idea that everything was simply rushed out the door as quickly as possible, without actualizing any of the game's alleged \"features\".   Beginning with the tutorial would often be the smart way to jump into a new game.  I'm not sure if it's a blessing in disguise, the tutorial is merely text based, forcing the player to read a bounty of information on how to use the awkwardly designed camera controls and interface.  It almost seems like the developers assessed what works in most RTS games and then went backwards to undo any real sense of control or immersion.  The interface is unnecessarily complex, often making it difficult to understand what is going on, let alone how you're going to complete the mission's objectives.  After suffering through the marginally helpful tutorial, I ventured into my first mission.  I had just been ejected from my jeep and needed to rendezvous with a fellow mercenary outside an enemy base.  This is where everything falls apart.  The game has a unique blend of Real Time and Turn Based strategy that seem to cancel each other out and create some sort of dark matter, sub-atomic anti-game.  Ok fine that doesn't really make much sense, but neither does the interface.  The commands are executed simply enough - the player clicks where the character should go, on whom he should fire, or by what he should take cover.  The cool part is you don't need to click once for a set path, you can make multiple points for a complicated movement, including firing or taking cover.  This is great on paper, but a combination of poor path-finding and faulty AI make the game difficult to play.   The incredibly irritating techno-heavy metal music starts pumping as two enemies approach.  It appears as if I can take cover behind a tree twenty yards away.  I click.  Oh snap!  Halfway there the game decides to pause and asks me to make another command decision.  How about you finish going where I told you to, punk?  A few more steps and I'm behind the tree, taking out my assault rifle, and preparing to dispatch some enemy that appeared out of absolutely nowhere.  As I ran to the tree, the enemy decided to lay face down in the mud, without any cover whatsoever, and point his gun forty degrees away from me.  Popping out from behind the tree, the aim meter slowly climbs to 100 and my mercenary fires at the enemy some 15 yards away.  Bang bang bang - Pause.  Yes, I would like to fire again.  After clicking four more times and emptying half a clip, the enemy is still alive and well in the open.  Frustrated, I decide to rush him - despite the fact he has a dominating position and could put five bullets in my face as soon as I leap out.  Not so much.  I run right up to him as he keeps sporadically firing at me.  In a shocking turn of events, whilst lying, he turns around and begins to crawl away.  Pause.  Bang bang!  Sweet I shot him in the ass and now he kind of slumps to the side a little bit.  I'm not sure if he's readjusting his boxers or bleeding to death.  I'm not really sure I care either.   Sometimes if games have absolutely breathtaking graphics, one might be able to overlook various other shortcomings.  Unfortunately there really is no saving grace for E5.  In most places, Goldeneye for N64 puts this game to shame.  The textures are terribly low-res, buildings are preliminary boxes that have some windows cut out, trees are comprised of triangular prisms and other offensive shapes (to the eyes, that is).  The cliffs are comprised of right angles, with virtually no smoothness to be found anywhere.  It gets worse.  By zooming the camera out and getting a bird's eye view of the level, there is an infinite blue horizon.  The developers were too lazy to render appropriate skies or backgrounds, so instead the player is immersed in what seems like a level-design program.  To the developers' credit, Brigade E5 does make an attempt to implement RPG-like stat-building elements into the game, in an effort to draw the player closer to his created characters.  There are various specialists, like demolition experts, snipers, and fighters.  Alas, even with these attempts, there is a substantial void where satisfactory gameplay should reside.  Consequently, the game is a lost cause in the end.   ",

        "Content": "Powerboat Challenge is obviously modeled after Midway's very successful arcade racer Hydro Thunder. But something was seriously lost in translation. For every one thing Powerboat Challenge does right, it fails elsewhere.  The setup is simple: choose a racer and enter a variety of races across four different islands. There are straight races, time trials, eliminator races, and overall best. It's a nice variety of races, and each island also has a tournament mode with between three to five races. If you win this and you scoop up a lot of money. Gold medals net you the most cash, though, and you need as much as you can to upgrade your powerboat. You can always go back and retry races at any time to reach 100-percent game completion.  Each island has a shop where you can purchase upgrades such as turbo, agility, top speed, and acceleration. The game encourages experimentation with customization by letting sell an upgrade back to the shop for full value. You can't change the look of the boat, though.  Control is done via touch or accelerometer. I found the touch controls unresponsive; steering the boat was like driving a bathtub. Tilt is only marginally better. If you don't max your agility, your boat is almost impossible to steer. There's no need to tilt the device forward to accelerate, the game does that on its own. As far as a sense of speed goes, even if you upgrade your boat to the best engine, the game is sluggish.  You gain turbo boosts by racing past the marked side of a buoy. The closer you are, the quicker your boost meter fills up. Tap your boat to activate your turbo. (The better your turbo boost parts are, the longer the boost will last.) Miss a buoy and your boost meter empties. Miss three in a race, and you're disqualified. There is no track map, nor any indicator of how close other racers are to you. You're also stuck with just one behind the boat camera view so if you cannot see the buoys very well, tough darts.  Other racers taunt you in curious ways. If you race as a girl, the guy racers just hit on you and flirt. Why? Only one person actually offers advice, the rest of the text plays out like a bunch of boys in junior high trying to hit on a college girl. Your opponents will gang up on you during a race. Sometimes it's too hard to pass them up because the boat physics are so wacky. Eliminated racers also end up stranded on the track and getting in your way.  The graphics are fantastic, though. Everything from the lens flare effect to the water reflections and different look of each island really impresses. There are environmental sound effects, but there no engine or wave splashing sounds. Also, you cannot turn off the music without turning off the sound effects. The music is some of the worst I've ever heard in a videogame for some time, so I had to give up the effects.   Powerboat Challenge was reviewed playing Version 1.0.1.  ",

        "Content": "Absurd as it is, there’s some entertainment to be had in the very concept of a top-down shooter based on the 1992 film that made Quentin Tarantino a famous director. But other than that novelty and some passable robbers-versus-cops gunplay, there’s not much to get excited about in Big Star’s simplistic adaptation, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days. Bloody Days puts you in charge of the crew from the live action Reservoir hDogs… sort of. Likeness rights were obviously not secured along with the name, as Mr. White is really the only character that bears any resemblance to his silver screen counterpart, Harvey Keitel. Mr. Pink, originally portrayed by Steve Buscemi, is an angry-looking dude with blond hair and a big goatee, while Mr. Brown seems modeled not so much on Tarantino as an MMA fighter stunt double that had to look enough like him to be convincing at a distance. It’s a little difficult not to be distracted by those discrepancies in a game that leans on such an iconic license. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The characters’ personalities aren’t really given a chance to shine, either. Almost every level includes lines lifted directly from the movie used out of context, in a very “Wink, wink, nudge, nudge” sort of way – Mr. Pink is introduced in a mission where you rob a bar, and he launches into his philosophical tirade about not tipping moments before the shooting starts. But the idiosyncrasies and conflicts within this dysfunctional band of ne’er-do-wells, which was basically what made the film work, don’t really have an impact at all. And while each titular dog has differing stats and a single special passive ability, their capabilities aren’t distinct enough that I didn’t feel like they were interchangeable 90 percent of the time. Mr. Blue regenerates health faster and Mr. Blond can keep a killstreak combo going longer, but these are subtle distinctions that seem geared more toward maxing out your score on every level rather than allowing you to come up with different and clever solutions to problems. Each mission involves between two and six characters attempting a robbery that, inevitably and disappointingly, erupts into a twin-stick gunfight almost immediately after some framing dialogue sets up the situation, every time. Though I’d recommend avoiding actual sticks, as the gamepad controls are far more fiddly and cumbersome than mouse and keyboard. The crooks are controlled one at a time in sequence, which is Bloody Days’ one clever idea.The crooks are controlled one at a time in sequence, which is where Bloody Days’ one clever idea and almost saving grace comes in: you move and shoot through an area as the first character, then rewind time and play over again as the second while the original character follows the script you previously set. This is a really cool idea. It’s an attempt to do something different, and a play on the film’s nonlinear structure. In certain situations it lets you set up some exciting combos and clear groups of enemies in staccato coordination that would be impossible to pull off alone. You can have two guys each clear one end of a hallway while a third slips into the back room to steal some cash, for example. But it doesn’t quite live up to the concept in practice. One character’s actions can change enemy behavior and invalidate the actions of your former self by, for instance, luring a foe out of what was originally a clear line of fire and throwing off the whole operation, so your pre-programmed partner ends up firing at targets who are no longer there. The tutorial boasts that you can rewind time to save a fallen comrade, but there were multiple cases where my rewind caused a character who had lived in their own timeline to die in the new one, resulting in mission failure. It became cumbersome and unpredictable just as often as it allowed me to execute an awesome, synchronized bloodbath. Every level essentially comes down to one shootout after another.The fact that every level essentially comes down to one shootout after another, be it with cops or rival thugs, also squanders the rewind mechanic’s potential. My mind was buzzing with ways it could have been used to create interesting puzzle challenges, stealth missions, or hostage scenarios even as I blasted a path through yet another repetitive horde level. Shades of a better game that makes use of these possibilities can be spotted on a few missions: my personal favorite required me to use three characters in concert to get several bags of money out of a bank vault in as few trips as possible. But those are only brief flashes in a game that took me around 15 hours, and the monotony of the vast majority of missions made me feel more like an urban guerilla than a criminal, since there’s never any way to pull off a smart heist without a hundred armed enforcers showing up. I also ran into some issues on the technical side. Most noticeable on later levels, hitching and slowdowns were common – particularly when loading into a level and using the rewind mechanic. In a couple of cases it even caused my video driver to crash. One level in particular wouldn’t even load on an older laptop I tried it on, despite that machine being above the minimum spec and able to handle much better-looking games. I’d be cautious trying to run Bloody Days on a lower-end system, even though it looks fairly unintimidating in the graphics department.",

        "Content": "Destiny 2 succeeds where the original failed the most: its delivery of a story-driven campaign good enough to match its finely tuned first-person shooter gameplay and great looks. Gathering loot and upgrades through missions and activities with my Fireteam and then finally running the climactic Raid together was a blast. And every time I thought my friends and I were scraping the bottom of the content barrel, Destiny 2 teased us with more that was just a few Light levels away. [Note: See our PC version impressions at the bottom of this review.]  From the opening moments, Destiny 2 delivers Dominus Ghaul, an excellent antagonist whose cruelty earns our fury by taking away everything that had been built up in Destiny and its expansions, including our Guardians’ Light. The campaign that follows is filled with brilliant cutscenes that give the cast an opportunity to show great emotional range, and you can hear the sadness and determination in their voices. Zavala (played by Lance Reddick) is unwavering in his plan to assault Ghaul, while Ikora (Gina Torres) seems distraught and near the point of giving up. That context gives both new and returning players a sensible reason to climb the Light-level based power ladder, whether for the first time or all over again. It kept me moving forward through fun missions set in eye-catching environments, including the exhilarating penultimate mission.   Meanwhile, a soaring soundtrack backs pulse-pounding missions before shifting gears to evoke a tinge of sadness. The sound design is impeccable overall, with rewarding splashes of glimmer each time you open a chest or a silencing of the ambient noise when you aim down sights. Every adjustment is important, giving you the audio information you need instead of overwhelming you with everything at once.  Bungie’s laid out a wide range of activities. “ To challenge us on the way back to the top, Bungie’s laid out a wide range of avenues that include Public Events, PvP (player vs. player) in the Crucible, roaming world bosses, treasure chests, Lost Sectors, Adventure side-quests, patrols, planet-specific challenges, Flashpoints, Vanguard missions, Exotic Quests, Strikes (Destiny’s dungeons, basically), the Nightfall (a more elaborate take on Strikes), the lengthy campaign, and of course the Leviathan Raid (the biggest, most complex dungeon).  Especially early on, there’s so much to do it’s almost overwhelming. I found myself frequently getting distracted from the activity I embarked upon by something enticing, like a roaming boss or public event that promised some quick loot. It’s a good problem to have, in that I never felt bored, but keep in mind these all seem targeted toward early Light level Guardians. While all of these battles will help get you to level 265, climbing to the max of 350 (the cap indicated in menu tips) is going to require tackling much tougher challenges like Leviathan, Nightfall, and Trials of the Nine – the endgame, in other words.  Every Bungie Game Ever Reviewed by IGN 19 Images  The final encounter fizzled out a bit. “ The campaign was my first priority, since the story had hooked me so well. But, after around 10 hours of buildup, the final encounter fizzled out a bit. Due to some awkward super ability restrictions, I had to resort to finding a safe spot and shooting the ultimate enemy in the foot until he died. It seems as though the encounter was meant for projectile supers, but without any way of knowing that going in, I hadn’t yet earned one that could do effective damage. It was an especially odd problem to have because Bungie has in the past shown that its Destiny 2 designers know how to make Strikes and Raid bosses interesting from a mechanical perspective, making the boss portion of the ending a surprising disappointment in what was an otherwise fantastic run.  Thankfully, the excellent quests and more elaborate Strikes that followed the campaign come with much-improved boss encounters and an extra dose of quality lore. After the campaign ends you can still experience some new story events via additional Quests on each of the four planetoid locations in Destiny 2. These not only flesh out the intriguing new characters we’ve met there, but also do a good job of guiding you into new spots you may have missed and fun encounters built to be played with a three-person Fireteam. They also end with big rewards, like Exotic Quests and coveted Legendary items, making them a great way to continue your climb to max Light. I’m hoping that Bungie doubles down on these with even more quests, either daily or weekly, as some left me wanting more.   The four world maps do a fantastic job of setting the tone, too. Whether it’s the milky waterfalls of Nessus or the overgrown European Dead Zone, each offers a colorful and unique palette to explore as you acquire their plentiful loot. Adding to that, there are also items scattered throughout each destination offering snippets of lore about the location, and gear sets you can acquire by turning in tokens earned from the above activities in exchange for reputation at that destination’s vendor. Bungie understandably wants to encourage everyone to take all this in, but goes a little too far by withholding the fast-moving Sparrow bikes for too long in order to force you to walk through it the first time (unless you get lucky and get one in a drop or pay for one via Bright Engrams).  “Stay Alert Out There” - Cayde-6  The first Destiny is a strong first-person shooter built using expertise from Bungie’s days developing the Halo series, but subtle touches have made a big difference in Destiny 2 when it comes to making moment-to-moment combat more explosive and exciting. For example, popping an enemy’s shield with the right damage type causes it to hit its nearby allies with area-of-effect damage, and scoring a headshot on a Fallen treats you to a light show as its soul escapes its body; both are welcome bursts of validation, and Destiny 2 dishes out these types of visual and gameplay rewards left and right.   Destiny 2 is full of game-changing items. “ While there aren’t a ton of different weapon types (as you’d see in something like Borderlands 2), the constant gear drops and game-changing Exotic weapons and upgrades propel your power level higher, creating that feeling of growing strength and readiness to take on all challengers. When I equipped my Titan with the Actium War Rig Exotic chestpiece that automatically reloads a portion of the ammo in your assault rifle over time, it increased my damage output dramatically in a way that was more interesting than simply boosting the damage value on each bullet. Alternatively, The Rat King hand cannon grants you invisibility if you reload immediately after a kill. Destiny 2 is full of items like these, and earning them feels like an achievement because of how much they change your play.  The gear chase has some rocky parts, though, because Destiny 2 doesn’t take the time to explain how its upgrade and infusion systems work. Mods can be a bit confusing at first because you have to absorb a lot of obscure rules. For instance, if the mods are Legendary they’ll add 5 attack power to your gear; however, if they don’t have a mod attached you can still infuse a Rare weapon into a Legendary weapon and see a Light level increase. Sound confusing? That’s because it is! But once you get acquainted with the math it’s a little more comprehensible. If you don’t want to have the same frustration at wasted progress that I did, I recommend checking our Destiny 2 wiki guide for tips on how to do it efficiently.  Destiny 2’s approach to the Shader system, which allows you to customize the colors of your various pieces of gear and weaponry, is also confusing and awkward because it encourages you to wait before applying any customization to your gear. Instead of a Shader color being something reusable which you unlock and then apply to whatever you like, they’re now consumables that must be individually earned as loot or purchased via the Eververse Trading Company. This feels at odds with Destiny 2’s focus on striving to evolve your weapons and armor, and I found myself simply holding onto my shaders until I had enough to not worry about coloring a piece of gear only to replace it when a better item comes along minutes later.   Also purchasable from the Eververse are The Bright Engrams, Destiny 2’s version of a premium loot box. They can include items like cosmetically different ships, Sparrows (some of which have different stats), mods, weapon skins, exotic emotes, and more. It seems like a place where Bungie could’ve gone wrong by prodding you to spend real money to get more, but so far that doesn’t appear to be the case. You are given free Bright Engrams each time you fill up your experience bar after hitting character level 20, so you should still feel like they’re in plentiful supply even if you opt not to spend money. You can also break down Eververse items for dust that will allow you to purchase from a rotating inventory of similar items.  Destiny 2’s three character classes – Titan, Warlock, and Hunter – have all been simplified relative to Destiny. Each of their subclass trees now only include an upper or lower power path with a few grenade, jumping, and power options, but that’s enough so that each still has distinct abilities and playstyles that work well together in traditional tank, support, and damage-dealer roles. Figuring out how to use subtle customizations and weapon pairings to make the most of your chosen build is still a rewarding puzzle to solve. For example, as a Titan you can build into an Arc damage type subclass which could then receive a boost from a Warlock that’s using Arc projectiles, if you planned properly. The Hunter’s dodge seems underpowered in the early stages, though, since the other classes’ abilities have a clearer immediate benefit to the team. While the Titan starts with a shield that protects everyone and the Warlock has a healing or damage-buff ability, the Hunter is left with a relatively weak dodge move that reloads or recharges their melee but does nothing for the team. It isn’t until they unlock a certain pair of Exotic boots that reload everyone’s ammo can fully contribute to the team in a way other than direct damage.  It’s unfortunate that while the first subclass (which allows you to specialize your character) is well integrated into the leveling experience with a story event of appropriate gravity, others just drop like an ordinary piece of loot. It was a missed opportunity to tell a story about reacquiring your powers, similar to the way Destiny’s The Taken King DLC gifted you with your new abilities. Once done doing world events to power up these random pickups things get better, and you embark upon on a more interesting quest to get a bit of backstory delivered by your Vanguard leader, but these moments don’t compare to their grandiose counterparts of Destiny.   Watching an upward sword strike send your enemy off in the distance will never get old. “ The biggest change to the overall game balance is a smart adjustment to one-hit kill power weapons. For the most part, they’re a blast to use – watching an upward sword strike that sends the embers of your enemy flickering off in the distance feels like it’ll never get old. In the player-vs-environment (PvE) areas, the bright-purple ammo packs that power these weapons are in constant supply, letting you frequently lay waste to enemies in spectacular fashion. On the other hand, in competitive game types power ammo can only be acquired by one team member each time it spawns, so you have to make each use count. This leads to more powerful moments and fewer cheap deaths.  Thankfully, the more conventional kinetic and energy weapons feel well balanced across the board, giving you different archetypes to choose from for each weapon type. Suros auto rifles, for example, have a higher rate of fire than the Omolon weapons, but reduced range, stability, and handling stats. Veist autorifle’s have the highest rate of fire and better reload speed, but again at the cost of range and stability. Each of the weapon types has these subtle differences, allowing you to create loadouts that compliment your character’s armor stats or Exotic abilities for the best efficiency possible.  “I’ve Got My Eye on You.” - Ikora Rey  Another major shift from Destiny is that the competitive experience of Destiny 2 relies more on team-based tactics, moving away from Destiny’s one-man-army style. The time to kill seems much longer because grenades and shoulder charges don’t always kill in one hit, and that gives you the opportunity to retreat from an encounter when your shields go down, like in Halo. That usually works well, since many of the 11 PvP maps (12 counting the PlayStation exclusive) are well suited for the new four-vs-four teams, but a few may be a tad too large. This makes it easy, and even strategic, to avoid the other team until you’re forced to clash in the center over a capture point, should the match go into overtime. But this excess room in certain maps often causes Competitive Playlist matches to drag on way too long without action.   Trials of the Nine is the new version of the Trials mode that’s been the lifeblood of PvP in Destiny for years, and it includes two different modes that alternate every week. The first, Survival, pits you against another four-player team to see who can whittle down the other side’s pool of lives first (not unlike a Battlefield match), while Countdown has you either defending a vital area or attacking and planting a bomb in said area (which should sound familiar to Counter-Strike fans). From what we’ve experienced in the Competitive Playlist, they’ve been very fun with a team once you get started, but it can take an excessively long time to find a match due to apparent bugs that Bungie has acknowledged are an issue.  Trials of the Nine opens up each weekend and encourages you to enter for your chance at Powerful Engram rewards resulting in top-tier gear. It’s still seven wins to go to the top of the ladder, which awards you a unique cosmetic aura, and you can simply reset your card with the press of a button (no more consumables necessary). At first, I was worried the departure from Trials of Osiris would be jarring, but it actually felt right at home with the same weight and nervousness in each encounter. They’ve also given all players a chance to earn rewards by giving tokens for participation, and they can be redeemed after your first win. More rewards continue to be unlocked until you finally finish off your card. It gives everyone something to strive for, regardless of level.  You aren’t allowed to pick and choose which modes you want to enjoy. “ The gray lining to the silver cloud that is Destiny 2’s various replayable modes is that you aren’t allowed to pick and choose which ones you want to enjoy at any given time. To play a Strike or any of the PvP Crucible modes you’re forced to join a queue that dumps you into a randomly selected map or mode, which is frustrating when you had a specific experience in mind. Worse, there’s no penalty for people who drop out and try again upon finding themselves in an undesirable match, like Supremacy when they wanted to play Clash. (Unless, of course, you count the long load times associated with jumping in and out of Crucible matches as a penalty.) That’s left my team and I in half-empty multiplayer matches many more times than I’d like.  555 Images  Also, a downside to bouncing between so many different types of activities is that it’s hard to keep a group together. World activities, PvP, and Leviathan all have different group size requirements, meaning you’re often a person short for some activities or forced to abandon a team member when transitioning from the four-player Crucible PvP into a three-man team activity like a Strike.  The new Clan system in Destiny 2 does a great job of giving people a reason to stick together. Now, our crew of IGN friends and family have begun completing team-based objectives and sporting our IGN banners with pride as we enter each activity to level up. It’s great seeing your Clan’s overall progress increase, and because it gives you a big reward for your personal contribution – and smaller rewards for overall clan objectives – it’s worth your time to join up with one. I’m looking forward to watching the engrams stack up as our Clan completes tasks for the week, or I’m able to finish one myself for the team.  “I Need My Fireteam.” - Zavala  The Leviathan Raid and its smaller end-game cousin, The Nightfall, are the premiere PvE events of Destiny 2, and so far they’re both successful in their purpose of keeping hardcore Destiny players like me coming back. The combat-focused Nightfall does this by forcing your three-person Fireteam to formulate a plan before going in so you can capitalize on whichever of the rotating set of modifiers you happen to draw. These can include extra goals like jumping through rings, killing enemies, or finding a specific target to increase the time left on the countdown clock, and they add a new level of challenge to each run, especially if you’re attempting to complete some of the harder quests at the same time. There’s a lot of skill and strategy that goes into running The Nightfall, and that makes it highly replayable.   T In addition to the nice loot drop, we’d made a new friend. “ o help anyone who ventures into Destiny 2 without a team experience this endgame content, Bungie has introduced a clever feature called Guided Games (currently in beta, but so far working great for us) that allow experienced teams to queue into a system that brings along a new player (with a microphone – it’s required) to teach them the ropes. After hopping in as a host, one other IGN clan member and I teamed up with a new friend who hadn’t played through The Nightfall in the past. In addition to the nice loot drop at the end and an emblem recognizing our helping a new player, we’d made a new friend. I hope that Bungie continues to foster this type of positive community engagement.  But the biggest, baddest PvE activity is Destiny 2’s Leviathan Raid, which continues to live up to Bungie’s high standards of new and varied puzzles and challenging boss battles that require teams of six well-coordinated players to pull off. I love how Leviathan immediately mixes up what you may expect from a Destiny Raid encounter and adds cutscenes showing off your Fireteam of six guardians.  Now, I’ll briefly discuss Raid mechanics, so if you don’t want to know anything at all about the Leviathan Raid before going in, please skip over the next two paragraphs.  Leviathan opens like most, forcing your team into a gauntlet-like activity where you need to plant flags in the ground to proceed. You then fight through three encounters before a final boss. This time, however, the encounters are varied and add new ways to fight, like one room where you’re forced to rely on stealth, and another that makes you run a gauntlet with a bomb as your team shoots arrows allowing you to proceed. Each experience forces your team into two groups and each forces you to work together to a common goal after you’ve met the requirements to enter, and it’s a clever approach that felt both challenging and distinct from any I’ve done before.   The architecture on display is a castle covered in ornate gold designs and mysterious machinery, leaving you to wonder who built it and why were you invited in? You learn some of those answers upon completion, and that lore reward added to my sense of accomplishment. And unlike Destiny’s previous Raids, this one dishes out some interesting story revelations, too. After completion you’re encouraged to return to find the treasure chests you’re given keys for as you clear each section, and there are additional secret chests you can unlock in the areas below the main arena. Should you not wish to return, you’ll still have tokens you can turn in for a chance at powerful Legendary weapons and a unique armor set for each class. Visually, it’s massive in scope as you scramble to the tops of an incredible building and still have the workings below to explore.  A few bugs forced us and other Raid teams to restart several times. “ A few bugs that forced us and other Raid teams to restart several times sullied my otherwise amazing experience, but Bungie says it’s working to address that issue. Also in the category of known issues still awaiting a fix as of this writing are crashes affecting PlayStation 4 Pro users playing in 4K – we’ve seen a few of those on the IGN staff.  With all of that content, there are 30 to 40 hours of great gameplay waiting for you in Destiny 2 before the Raid. When you approach max Light level, though, there are only a few activities that someone who loves the level climb like I do can participate in to get Raid-ready. I wish that more Adventures had an additional incentive, such as a reward for completing all of them on a given destination or a Powerful Engram for completing a particular set that told an interesting story. It’s unfortunate that most progression is tied to Public Events, as they give a huge experience drop for each heroic completed and they spawn so frequently. Even the weekly Flashpoints consist of simply completing Public Events on a certain planet.   That said, once you’re ready for the Leviathan Raid you can hop in and tackle its many challenges for loot. Once completed, Quests like the Destroyer of Worlds line will advance, allowing you to enter an extra-challenging Strike mission.  Bungie has promised that Destiny 2 will continue to evolve with a roadmap of content on the way that already includes Trials of the Nine added today, and Faction Rally on September 26. Looking into October, they’ve already teased the Prestige difficulty Raid and Iron Banner, another popular PvP mode for competitive players. Hopefully, Bungie can keep up this cadence as the additions so far have been expansive. Time will tell if Iron Banner and Faction Wars can keep up the same level of excitement as a Raid.  Update: PC Version Impressions, October 25, 2017  Destiny 2 on PC looks stunning should you be running it at 4K 60fps, or as high as your PC and monitor permit. I consistently found myself stopping simply to admire the environment or PvP gameplay I was enjoying at 120 frames per second on my Ryzen 1800x and Titan X (Pascal), even while streaming my gameplay at 1080p 60fps using OBS. Compare that to the locked 30 frames per second on consoles. On an Intel Core i5-7600K with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 and 16GB of RAM we saw framerates of 120 and up at 1080p while exploring the open world at max settings. In a graphical sense, playing on PC is noticeably nicer than the PlayStation 4 Pro where I originally spent the majority of my time playing. Small details like the sparkling textures on the ceiling of the Pyramidion Strike or the additional lighting effects for explosions and skyboxes are dramatically better here. After adding a 144hz monitor into the mix it was hard not to be enamored with the incredible smoothness on display. The biggest miss for the PC version is the absence of a general chat window where you can freely talk to anyone and everyone in the zone, as you’d expect to find in virtually any large-scale multiplayer game. Without one we’re spared from spammers and people being deliberately annoying, but at the same time it’s needlessly difficult to interact with players you encounter who are not already on your friends list. You can message random players in your Fireteam if you’ve entered a strike and your team in the Crucible, but they will have to hit enter on their keyboard to see the message. This additional barrier to communicating gives the console version of Destiny one strong advantage: the ability to easily make new friends in the tower or open world before heading into a mission. Overall, the PC is the best platform on which to play Destiny 2. “ But overall, the PC is the best platform on which to play Destiny 2. Options like key remapping, intuitive controller support (including separate tuning for controller vs. keyboard and mouse that makes each feel like a competent option), and a field-of-view slider allow you to build an experience customized exactly to your liking. There is a concern that aim assist for controllers might be used by cheaters to gain an advantage in PvP by fooling Destiny 2 into thinking they’re using a gamepad when they’re actually on a mouse, but thankfully we have yet to encounter anything that suggests that’s a real problem rather than a theoretical one. Time will tell if this becomes a rampant, but meanwhile, Bungie appears to be committed to keeping the PC free of cheaters to the point where it’s potentially a detriment. Bungie has implemented a strict lockdown on what you can do while you’re playing because of a fear of cheats. The official site warns that third-party applications like Discord, OBS Game Capture can be used with restrictions, and anything that puts an overlay over the gameplay other than Nvidia Shadowplay or AMD ReLive could potentially cause problems. That said, those restrictions haven’t impacted my experience while playing with my friends so far. We opened Discord in the background and were able to chat freely. When using OBS I did run into difficulties when trying to take screenshots, but when streaming software was turned off everything I typically use worked as intended.",

        "Content": "It's one thing to be disheartened when a development team repackages a Game Boy Advance title as a Nintendo DS game, but it's almost even more disheartening when a development team creates an original game that's far worse than versions created on the GBA. Spyro: Shadow Legacy is a unique game in the Vivendi Universal franchise that continues the exploits of the little purple dragon, but this adventure is so bad that the much more limiting titles released on the GBA are far more fun and fulfilling, and clearly had more time to bake in the development oven. This game is sluggish and chuggy, and, by a far margin, the worst entry in the Spyro series.  Spyro the Dragon began its life on the original PlayStation system as a really excellent collect-a-thon platformer featuring an adorable purple dragon that's small in stature but big in heart. The game and character were strong enough to move through several console sequels, and eventually end up in an original set of Game Boy Advance adventures developed by Digital Eclipse. These isometric designs were tailored for the GBA's more limited hardware, but even with the limitations the games were fun and faithful to the original 3D platformers.  Though there hasn't been a real Spyro adventure for more than a couple of years, Sierra feels that the dragon has some legs for an original dual-screen adventure. Amaze Entertainment , already a key player in the handheld realm, went to work on a new design that combines Spyro action elements with a much more RPG flair. Its action is similar to Castlevania in the sense that Spyro can attack with an array of moves that whittle down enemies' hitpoints. He can also upgrade his abilities by leveling up with experience points earned by enemies he takes out, as well as scoring and equipping special medallions acquired throughout the quest.  The game's beginning shows some of the ineptness in the game's design: the adventure begins with a cutscene that starts with storybook text on the upper screen. What does the lower screen display? Uglier subtitles that read out the exactly the same thing as the upper screen text. If that's not brilliant use of the second screen…  But it would be unfair to pick apart one silly little instance of Spyro and say it's a bad game. But luckily, the rest of the package is just as sloppy as the game's intro. While  many of the visual elements -- like wonderfully rendered backgrounds and nicely modeled 3D sprites -- get a decent thumbs up, any work that went into them is destroyed by an engine that can't handle displaying them. Scrolling is absurdly slow and choppy with some serious first-generation sprite glitching all over the place.  The programming that handles the height mapping on the flat 2D background is inconsistent and has severe overlapping issues in places.  And the attack collision between Spyro and the variety of enemies is wonky at best -- players sometimes connect and sometimes miss with no rhyme or reason, and they can even attack through walls and obstacles because of the poor handling. It's difficult to tell which ledges are accessible and which are not due to the drawn perspective as well as the lousy invisible walls mapped to them.   A lot of the engine issues can probably be attributed to an overambitious story that revolves around two versions of the same world. The adventure and most of the puzzles require Spyro to constantly leap back and forth between the real world and a shadow version of the same area in order to solve puzzles and earn experience. Because players swap between these realms on-the-fly, the game has to retain two versions of the area in the limited memory of the Nintendo DS system. The engine is clearly being overtaxed.  But this is only part of the problem. The game's scripting is horrible, with sloppy trigger points that interrupt the action at the most awkward of moments. The button mapping wasn't thought out very well, either; the X button is used for opening doors, swapping between realms, and attacking enemies, so there will be times where players will activate a realm swap or a trigger point while trying to take out an enemy.  The secondary portion of the screen is used for inventory display and selection, so it's utilized modestly for most of the game. But then the team decide to also use it for some clearly unnecessary character and drawing recognition for specific tasks. Want to teleport to another part of the map? Draw a triangle to pull up the map. Need to move an item out of the way? Jot down an equals sign. It's a control element that's completely unnecessary and draws too much attention to itself as a \"what are we going to do with the touchscreen?\" moment in the design pitch. Even if the development team didn't intend it to, Spyro: Shadow Legacy screams \"B title\" all the way through. ",

        "Content": "You've got to feel bad for Voltron fans. There's been no shortage of Transformers games released on a semi-regular basis over the past couple of decades on almost every console known to man, yet Voltron has been adapted into precisely one videogame thus far: a 2010 iPhone game which has subsequently been removed from the Appstore. Ouch.  Enter Voltron: Defender of the Universe, a scrolling 'bullet hell' style shoot-'em-up in which up to five players can blaze away as each of the five mech lions that together form the appendages of the titular robot warrior.    Each lion supposedly has its own strengths and weaknesses, at least according to the character selection menu, but in practice there isn't a whole lot of difference between them – they all have the same standard laser turret attack, melee move and (admittedly cool) aerial pounce for taking out flying vehicles, along with a unique special move that's fueled by the star pieces you find hidden in each level.  Otherwise there are a scarce few power-ups to be found – such as the Megathrusters which enable you to blast mindlessly in four directions simultaneously instead of just one – but for the most part this is pretty by-the-numbers twin-stick stuff as you circle-strafe your way through waves of the same half-a-dozen enemy types from start to finish.  There are occasional change-ups to the formula – sometimes you'll need to defend a base under attack, other times you'll have to escort human convoys to a safe zone – but for the most part the game is a tiresome slog through nondescript planetside levels and generic asteroid fields in space.  Yet the reason Voltron: Defender of the Universe is such a disappointment isn't because the lion-based gameplay is so formulaic, it's because the actual Voltron parts are so terrible . There are three chapters in the game, each broken up into four levels that culminate in a boss fight. At these points you get to form Voltron, and by that I mean you get to watch footage from the cartoon series and complete some prompted thumbstick flicks, but you never really control him at all. Instead, the three boss fights are turn-based affairs where you choose from four attacks, execute one with a golf game-style swing-timer, and then attempt to block your opponent's attack via a rudimentary quicktime event. If you're playing co-op, you take turns as to who times the attack and who lines up a reticule to determine how effective the attack will be.  That's it. That's your Voltron experience. Even the aforementioned iPhone game had a deeper, Street Fighter-style beat-'em-up mechanic – it's honestly a shame that you can't buy it anymore.

        "Content": "When I first saw the title of this game, I thought it said Stacked Cheese because the entire title of the game didn't appear on the phone. I thought to myself, \"Why would anyone make a game about stacking cheese?\" I then started the game only to realize it was really called Stacked Cheerleaders . I then thought to myself, \"Why would anyone make a game about stacking cheese unless it offered nutritional value and cheese recipes?\"  Stacked Cheerleaders is an engrossing, in depth hand-eye coordinating orgy of demanding puzzles where you travel to various exotic locales searching for clues that will lead you to the whereabouts of exotic treasures. Oh, I'm sorry. I have this game confused with something that would actually be interesting to play. This is merely a game where you stack cheerleaders. Boy, do I feel silly!  Stacking cheerleaders should be fun until you realize you are only stacking them one on top of another. There is no movement to the cheerleaders and each one has the same pose of their legs and arms apart. A helicopter lowers the cheerleaders above your stack and you press the center or 5 button to drop the cheerleader on the stack. Time it right and drop her perfectly on top of the cheerleader below her and you start the combo meter that multiplies your points. Off center just a bit and the meter goes back to zero. It's very boring because after playing for about ten minutes there just isn't enough to keep you interested.  I would liked to have seen a game where you can stack different formations of your cheerleaders but the only formation here is a vertical one. The cheerleaders have no physics or animations to them and they look like plastic monkeys with wigs and pom poms. How fun would it be to be able to stack your cheerleaders in the craziest formations you can think of and watch as they sway back and forth trying to keep their balance? Or stack them in different spots besides a stadium, like on a boat or during a wind storm? How fun would it be if you played this game in a biker bar, giggling as loud as you can while taunting everyone to see if they can beat your high score?  In Stadium Mode do your best to stack cheerleaders and see how many spirit points you can achieve. The more spirit points you earn, the more people begin to fill in the stadium. You can choose between four teams with the only difference being how many cheerleaders you need to stack and the color of their outfits. Each team also has their own Mascot you place on top of your stack, and if you make a nice enough stack you can place a special Mascot on top if it's available. Once you've finished your stack, you place them in a spot on the stadium floor. I feel really stupid writing this.  In Quick Game mode, I managed to stack my cheerleaders high enough to where they reached the moon. I suppose if I had really concentrated I could have gotten higher, but after my 50th cheerleader I began to lose focus and not care. Miss the stack three times and your game is over. Get a high enough score and you can log it online to compare it other stackers. There is a Tell a Friend option and if you enter your cell phone number you'll receive a text message you can forward on to your friends. I tried this option so I could forward information about this game to everyone I knew but I kept getting an error message. Perhaps the gods were looking out for me.  I'm not sure what market this game is supposed to cater to. Puzzle enthusiasts? Is this a game for women? I handed it to my girlfriend and asked her to give it a try. She had fun stacking the cheerleaders and laughing when she'd miss and they'd fall of the stack. Then ten minutes went by and she claimed she was bored already and handed the phone back to me. Guess it doesn't market well to females either. Playing this made me think I had to open my mouth and drool on my own shirt so I felt like I was the intended audience.  Graphics reminded me of the 8-bit Nintendo days which is not a compliment. Every cheerleading team looked the same except for the color of their outfits or their skin tone. Sound effects were absent with only the sound of music in the background as you play. The music is the same loud trumpet loop and after thirty seconds of listening to it will cause your ears to bleed and test your will to live.  (Note from Levi: This game is based entirely on DChoc's hit Tower Bloxx -- it's essentially a re-skin. And since George hadn't played the original, I thought it would be interesting to see his fresh take. And, well, it was.)",

        "Content": "I didn’t hate the dozens of hours I spent shooting generic aliens and mutants in Defiance, but I know I’m not going back to it, either. Rather than the addictive, \"Where did the day go?\" sort of experience I had when I started out my adventures in World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic, Defiance doesn’t do anything special enough to hook me, even for the short term. Decent story missions and well-designed dungeons are too few and far between, and the vast intervening stretches are filled with some of the dullest and most repetitious quest design I’ve experienced in an MMO, punctuated by polish issues in the form of major framerate problems, lots of pop-in, and regular lag. The competitive multiplayer entertains for a while, but that and a few other redeeming features ultimately aren’t enough to make Defiance worth spending more than a short time with. One of those redeeming features is the story, which actually managed to be interesting. It doesn’t provide a good backstory about the world – that's seemingly left to the companion SyFy TV show – but the story-driven missions are the most enjoyable of the PvE content. These missions have fully voiced cutscenes that do us the courtesy of providing a stronger justification for why we have to collect three of something or rescue four ranchers. Some of them even manage to mix things up a bit, going against Defiance’s otherwise trite, largely fetch-quest-driven design, and introduce a couple of likeable, if totally clichéd, characters. I like some of the implications it makes about the Defiance universe -- specifically, that some of what we're told about the history of the human-alien conflict might not be entirely true. If you do just power straight through the single-player content you won’t boost your EGO all that much, though that doesn’t matter as much as you might think. EGO is Defiance's substitute for the traditional leveling system, and though its numbers go into the thousands instead of capping at the usual 50 or 60, it bothered me that I never felt substantially more powerful as I progressed. I might unlock a new perk to put into a loadout, which changes up minor stats, but I could only ever equip one of Defiance’s four active powers at a time, and the earliest enemies were still potentially lethal. (Or they would be, if the AI weren't terrible.) The upside to this system is that anyone can group with friends or strangers and feel on mostly equal footing. Though don’t expect to easily do quests together, since there’s no good way to share them, and if you do a story mission while grouped it just cuts everyone else out and treats you like you’re playing solo. Instead of making your character feel uniquely yours through abilities, Defiance puts a bigger emphasis on the guns you choose. For example, I play extremely aggressively most of the time, so I tend to focus on equipping shotguns and heavy machineguns. If I’m in a dungeon I might equip a beam weapon that allows me to heal my teammates. It’s nice to have flexibility to change up my playstyle with weapons, but I do wish Defiance did more with its active powers – or gave us more than one at a time – to mix things up a bit more. With no traditional classes there’s really no reason to ever make more than one character, especially since they are going to experience the exact same story no matter their species or which background you pick for them in the basic character creation process. Picking the guns you want in your loadout is probably the most important choice you can make in Defiance because you’ll be doing a lot of shooting. It’s a mechanically competent third-person action game, but the barely functional enemy AI makes most battles a breeze. Things get tough when they throw a swarm of mutants, monsters, or bandits at you, but, with rare exception of enemies who have a gimmick (like only being vulnerable from behind), they aren’t very engaging to fight. It’s really a shame that the encounters aren’t more fun, too, because it would have helped make it easier to look past the side quests, which range from mediocre to awful. Most boil down to the most derivative sort of fetching – find and activate three generators, locate three clues, kill 10 enemies... the stuff MMOs are frequently made fun of for. Others break things up a bit by introducing time-trial races or tasking you with using a specific weapon to wreak havoc or survive as long as possible, but even these became a bit tiresome as I progressed. The absolute worst was when I hit a bugged one and had to abort and restart it in order to complete it (this occurred on PC, but as it and the 360 version are so similar in content and the bugs are seemingly random we can’t rule out that it could happen here too). But they do pay out good experience, making it hard to overlook them if you’re aiming to up your EGO. Defiance has some more entertaining ways to get experience, including some pretty good dungeons. Seriously, it feels like the dungeons were designed by a totally different team, because while they often have fetch quest-y components, they also have some of the cooler bits of story to make them feel less pointless. Moreover, they almost always feature a boss battle that actually requires skill and involves enemies that are much more challenging than those in the world at large. They’ll get old if you just repeat them over and over, sure, but experiencing each for the first time feels like a treat compared to most of the regular quests. The dungeons also provide a chance for some much-needed social interaction, because those were pretty much the only time other players wanted to work together. Defiance doesn’t have any major cities, nor does it have other things like crafting to create a player economy and foster interaction. And the obviously Rift-inspired Ark Fall events don’t help all that much, either. While people gather up to take part in them, they’re usually so packed with players that there’s no threat or reason to communicate and work together. This action is set in a world that’s gone to hell, but it’s a shame that it feels so lonely. You can also avoid the grind of side quests – and potentially get some more social time in – with Defiance’s decent competitive multiplayer. Both the deathmatch mode and Shadow War (large-scale, capture point missions) end up as some of the better gameplay Defiance has to offer, mostly because shooting players is a whole heck of a lot tougher than anything the AI has to offer. And because Defiance doesn’t follow a typical leveling scheme you can jump in immediately and put up a fight, though it can feel a bit unfair because higher-EGO players will have somewhat better equipment and a potentially greater number of perks. It's a good thing these modes are reasonably fun, because it's the only thing to do in Defiance after you've burned through the content. At least, it's reasonably fun when it works smoothly – which hasn't been often in Shadow War. The Xbox 360 version regularly drops frames, suffers from screen tearing, has significant pop-in, and textures look muddy enough that it’s sometimes hard to pick out targets at a distance. Deathmatch generally ran smoothly enough, but it sometimes struggles with the number of players in Shadow War. Lag has also been an issue. Plus whenever lots of players gather, half of them appear as the default male player model until eventually popping in their actual customized character. The Shadow War queue is considerably shorter here than on PC, but gameplay wise it’s performed poorly enough that it’s hard to play. Other issues like bugged quests screwed up sessions on PC, though it’s hard to say if they’ll also occur on the other versions since they’re seemingly random. Every MMO I’ve ever played has issues at launch, but Defiance would be just okay even if it were working perfectly. It can't afford hiccups like these. The Show, Game, and Where They Meet Given the way Trion and SyFy have been building up the \"trans-media\" tie-in, I'm disappointed by how little Defiance the MMO intersects with Defiance the show. Sure, they’re set in the same world, but since the game takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area and the show takes place 2,000 miles away in St. Louis, the connection is already loose. Main characters Nolan and Irisa appear in the game in a few missions that serve as a precursor to how they end up around the town of Defiance, but that's about it so far. I can’t say that playing the MMO improved the show, but watching the show definitely gave me a better introduction to the universe in two hours than the game did in 20. For more on that, read my review of the Defiance TV show.",

        "Content": "Telling Lies is a storytelling marvel. Every smile, every kiss, every lie reveals something meaningful about the characters and the way their lives intertwine, and seemingly insignificant comments link together to become crucial revelations. It follows the same structure as developer Sam Barlow’s previous game, Her Story , with a database of video clips that you watch out of sequence—but Telling Lies is bigger and better in every way.  Sublime acting by a cast of four main characters makes every scene believable, and each clip is a potential door into a new sub-plot. One shows David, who features most often, talking to a woman on the phone while in bed, their conversation veiled in subtext and secrets. The next might show an environmental group organising a protest that you know must be important because you’ve heard about before. If you tug on any thread it will slowly unwind, and I wasn’t able to let go until I’d fully unravelled it and learned how it fits into the wider story.   You play from the perspective of a woman on her laptop in a sleek apartment, trawling through an NSA surveillance database for an unknown reason. Searching keywords shows clips organised by date: search something vague like ‘love’ and you’ll get 34 matches, but the system limits you by only allowing you to watch the five earliest clips. By watching more, you learn to narrow your searches to focus on specific topics, eventually getting to the juicy bits.  You follow the interconnected lives of Emma, a nurse, played by Kerry Bishé (Argo), environmental activist Ava, played by Alexandra Shipp (X-Men Apocalypse), webcam model Michelle, played by Angela Sarafyan (Westworld), and the mysterious David himself, played by Logan Marshall-Green (Spider-Man: Homecoming). To say more would be to spoil it, because figuring out exactly how their lives interact is the best bit of Telling Lies. It starts off simple and becomes wonderfully dark and twisted, and each new storyline you discover is another rabbit hole to dive into.  You can scrub through clips by clicking and dragging your mouse to speed up or slow the footage, which made me feel like a cop in a police procedural, and I regularly rewound through sections to pick up scraps I’d missed the first time around.  The acting is some of the best I’ve seen in any video game. “ The acting is some of the best I’ve seen in any video game. What makes the performances so remarkable is that even though every word in Telling Lies’ script is deliberately placed so that you can search for it in the database, nothing feels forced. The cast make me feel the weight of each line, whether they’re crying to a loved one or having phone sex. I often lost myself in the raw emotion of a scene, forgetting my task at hand. Shipp is particularly good as Ava: likeable, tragic, and complex.  The writing matches the acting for quality, and there’s always a deeper meaning to what a character says and doesn’t say, such as when David reads bedtime stories to his daughter. Conversations between two people are split into separate clips so that you can only hear one side of the audio at a time. They’re written so that, if you think hard enough, you can pinpoint the other perspective in the database, which is often a missing puzzle piece. It’s clever.  I like how the plot meanders and then changes pace abruptly. Some clips are five-minute monologues, others are 30-second arguments. Action punctuates the conversations: you’ll see gunshots, protests, parties, and fights, and you’ll start to organize the timeline around these key events. Clips vary in style from simple front-on webcams to shaky handheld footage, and you’ll be taken into boats, bedrooms, tents, cars, and community halls. The variety kept me on my toes throughout the six hours of footage.  9 Images  You constantly flip back and forth in the timeline, which lends the plot an imperfect, very human feel. It’s messy in the way few games stories are, and I couldn’t predict where it was going. I like that it never hurries you, and unlike in Her Story you can’t track what percentage of the total videos you’ve watched and what remains unseen. It lets you follow a side plot blindly, only stopping to jot down a pertinent name or a potential keyword for later. Or, if you can’t wait to find out what happened, you can just rush towards the ending.  And just like in Her Story, every playthrough feels different and personal. You’re supposed to be the mystery woman at the laptop, but the ambient noise from her apartment and the clack-clack of her keyboard as you type made me feel like I was the one sifting through the data. The route you take to the end changes your perception of what you see, and nd there’s something magical about knowing you’re probably the only person who has watched that exact combination of clips.  My only complaint is the occasionally clunky UI. “ My only complaint is the occasionally clunky UI. It’s little but persistent things, like the way the laptop’s note-taking app doesn’t automatically scroll to where you’re typing, nor does it respond to your mouse’s scroll wheel. To type past the bottom of the page you have to click and drag on the scroll bar, which is annoying, and I found a bug where my cursor was one line lower than everything I was typing.  Additionally, the video player is always full-screen and you can't minimise or resize it to jot down your thoughts. It doesn't save your position in clips, either, so if you close a clip to make that note and then re-open the video, you’re back to where you originally started watching. Basically, it gives you no reason to use the in-game note app instead of a physical pen and paper, which takes you out of the world.  Tagging clips to organise them for later is also a pain because you can’t create tags in the video player itself: you have to bookmark the clip, close it, open the database, find the clip in your bookmarks, bring up the tag menu and then label it. It’s not worth the hassle.  I could forgive Her Story’s clumsiness because it fit the fact you were trawling through an old police computer system. But when you’re sitting on a modern laptop in a contemporary apartment it feels awkward, and sometimes broke the flow of the story.  But that story is bold enough that I’ll happily put up with the UI issues. I finished my first playthrough in just under four hours, but learning that I’d left two hours of footage untouched meant I couldn’t help but jump straight back in to learn more. Now, I’ve nearly exhausted the database and I’m still finding fascinating details about the characters’ backgrounds, their motivations, and the lies they’ve told along the way. ",

        "Content": "Craig Jones was a rising British motorcycle gun. At 23, he'd finished fifth in the World Supersport Championship and been awarded the title of Young Rider of the Year. But on the 4th of August 2008 at the Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, Jones was thrown off his Honda while travelling at 120mph and was struck by another bike. He died in hospital the next day.  Jones hasn't been the only casualty. In 2003 Daijiro Kato was fatally wounded in a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix and prior to that five-time world motorcycle king Joey Dunlop was killed during a race in Estonia in 2000.  Fact is, motorcycling is one of those past times your mama don't want you to know about – up there with tail gunner or grenade tester. It's a fiercely nerve-racking craft that likely leaves even seasoned riders with post-race underpants that resemble a mechanic's rag. While mothers know this, it's a fact that has again escaped the scope of the SBK franchise.  SBK: 09 is straight from the churn. For those unfamiliar with the series, they're bare-boned motorcycling simulators that use the SBK license as a life rope. Casual racers in particular should beware, SBK: 09 is not a podium-girl-banging stud who'd happily out ride an explosion while screaming out the lyrics to Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone. It's a German engineer in a helmet set to go home and make 'efficient' love to his wife. In other words, it works. But it's boring.  To be fair, developer Milestone has done well with the paltry resources they've been given. Mobilising the spin that SBK: 09 is a solid racer sans bells and whistles, it rides pleasantly – no question. While we've never raced motorcycles at speeds that tickle the theory of relativity – and so can't speak from experience – the bikes handle with the litheness of a saucy Russian gymnast (again, though, we can't speak from experience). Taking corners by balancing between the front and rear brakes while dropping gears feels as manly as punching a Grizzly in the neck, while duelling for position with another rider can lock players into a welcome state of comatose. And of course there's the usual raft of tweaks players can make to their bike to improve performance for different conditions, as well as driver assists that can be used or abandoned.  That's all good and shiny, but SBK: 09's physics and handling aren't the problem. The problem is that it has no bollocks. It's no longer okay to excuse languid design and impotent vision by claiming \"simulation\" immunity. As mentioned, real professionals can die on the track at furious speeds. It happens in real motor sport. Yet SBK: 09 makes no attempt to innovate and capture the intensity of blitzing along at over 200 kilometres an hour with your balls halfway up your throat.   More excitement in the crashes would go a long way.  That's a problem. For one the whole simulation-versus-arcade spectrum is rapidly becoming an anachronism in a movement spearheaded by none other than EA. During a recent interview with the producer of Need for Speed: SHIFT, Jesse Abney coughed up a donkey leg at the notion of having to park his wheels into one specific garage. Why the beef? Because there's no reason one can't have an exciting racing game that adheres to real-world physics. Are real-world drivers settling into their leather seats with a frosty slush and Fall Out Boy playing on their iPod before they drive for their lives? Hell no. Racing games must set out to recreate the tension going on in the driver's mind, not break the experience down into an expressionless physics lesson.  Yet that's how SBK: 09 plays. At one point we had to wipe up a pool of zombified drool after we found ourselves zoned out on our 10th lap of Australia's Phillip Island. It wasn't a case of immersion – it was a case of turning on auto-pilot as we picked our racing lines, slowed down, sped up, and repeated. Back in 2000 this was acceptable play, but SBK: 09 lacks a point if gamers can extract an identical experience from games released years ago.  Switching to the dash view is, as always, more immersive. Yet as ever, there's been no attempt to make this view mandatory. It's fine for straights, for instance, but when entering the game's many hairpins the screen remains focused on the view directly ahead rather than the exit. Drivers don't keep their heads locked straight ahead. How hard could it have been to adjust this?  The sound design is also non-existent. It fails to capture any drama or sense of speed, bound down by engine noises that sound like a kid blowing bubbles in milk, and a howling pop-punk soundtrack that repeats.   In TV speak, the whole thing lacks sizzle. What's contradictory is how this didn't prevent Milestone from adding pizzazz to the trackside Umbrella Girls. These polygonal wads of booty speckle the grid before a match and feature cup sizes that sound like co-ordinates from a game of Battleship.  If only the rest of the game had such mesmerising cleavage. When we first loaded it up we actually exited back to our menu screen to ensure the console hadn't somehow dropped to a lower resolution. No, it turns out that's just how SBK: 09 rolls. The biker's bodies are fine, but the grandstands are composed of stagnant pixels that are supposed to be living spectators and the textures – well – we've seen better on refrigerator crayon drawings. Meanwhile the trees are so dog-ugly Hayden Panettiere would cut them down. In the game's defence the frame-rate is steady and the draw distance on the game's 13 official tracks is impressive. While we're glad Milestone opted for performance over detail, we'd have preferred it if they'd succeeded with both.    At least it's got its precious license. The funny thing about heavily licensed games like SBK: 09, and even Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli, is that this can be both boon and bear trap. On one hand there's the good: all the official teams, like Ducati, BMW, and Suzuki, are present, famous racing names like Troy Corser and Max Biaggi are there to wave from the podium, and all the tracks have been carved out in detail. The downside is that this can lead to bland content, such as the structure of the game's Championship. No one would deny that gazillion dollar-racing teams should have ample opportunity to partake in warm-up laps, free practice runs, and qualifying practices before a big race, but it's not necessary to put all that stuff in a videogame when there's already a Practice mode available. Apart from the Championship, players get a limp Challenge mode that places them at arbitrary points on the map and charges them to reach the finish line under a set time or perform long skids through curvy sections of track. Yawn.  Fortunately the saving grace is – you guessed it – full online support. Gamers keen to flash their mechanic muscle against other like-minded bike buffs can burn up opposition in Quick Races or online Championships that can be played every-man-for-himself, or in teams. But is that really enough to justify picking this up, given such features have become par for the course? We'd say no.",

        "Content": "Kart racers are supposed to be about fun. After all, if we wanted a serious, realistic racing challenge there are serious, realistic racing sims out there. But when it comes to taking control of a cute little toy racer, zipping around a track, and picking up and using all sorts of dastardly power-ups, there should be a smile on your face. Unfortunately, when it comes to Smashing Toys , a kart racer from French developer Leon Brothers , the only thing on your face will be an annoyed frown. Smashing Toys' sins are many. The gameplay is poorly thought out, the load times are tediously long, the graphics are relatively crude and it's a performance hog at the highest detail settings.  Smashing Toy's concept is that a bunch of different toys have \"come alive\" and must race to stay alive. That's about it for plot, so it's all about racing on 25 different tracks on three different worlds. The kicker is that you have to earn enough points in each track to unlock the next, a limitation that's all the more painful when it becomes clear just how difficult it is to amass all those points. You basically have to drive perfectly to finish in the top three, which you'll need to do to have a chance at unlocking the next track. Yet the racing action is so chaotic and random at times that it feels practically unfair. Smashing Toys ignores virtually every lesson learned from other kart games. For instance, the handling on the vehicles is ham-fisted, and the driving model feels nonexistent. Just try to drift at high speed in this game; you're more likely to just slam into the wall.  Good handling is everything when you're requiring split second reactions to dodge objects, such as mines in your path.   Your toys like to gesture a lot.  Second, the tracks are far too narrow, making the various power ups strewn about the track almost impossible to miss. That's great news if you're in the lead, but if you're in the middle of the pack, odds are that the racer in front of you is getting all the goodies. It's a mind-boggling case of the rich getting richer while everyone else gets nothing. This is especially irritating when it comes to the repair power-up. Your toy racers have health bars; if they take too much damage they start to fall apart. If the bar drops to zero, you're dead and you have to restart the race. Unfortunately, the repair items are few and far between on the tracks, so eight racers might be accumulating damage but only one or two of them can ever get repaired. And, yes, more often than not, it's the guy in the lead who gets there first. If you ever played a great car racer, like the Mario Kart series, then you know the key is to offer plenty of power-ups so that everyone has close to an equal shot of getting something.  The power-ups themselves range between useful to cross-your-fingers. There's a shield which can protect you, a boost that can speed you up, but then there are deployable mines that are completely erratic in effectiveness. The problem is that the mines don't explode on contact; instead, they fly away on impact and explode a half second later, so it's possible to avoid the explosion. When you see the guy ahead of you hit a mine and then escape unscathed but you're the one affected by the explosion, you'll want to scream. The explosion can send you hurtling off the track, which means that you'll have to respawn back into the race. And that brings up another incredibly annoying issue; you might be driving perfectly and a car spawns a car in front of you with no warning and with no time to avoid it. I've lost a race that way.   Get used to seeing this loading screen a lot. As completely random as the racing can be, the loading times are far worse. They're among the longest I've experienced in almost two decades of PC gaming. Seriously, they're that long, which is mind-boggling for \"just a kart game.\" The loading times are so long I could log onto my bank's web site and pay bills while I was waiting. And what's worse is that these load times are pervasive. Let's say you're racing a track and you're not having much luck. If you restart the race (a process that in most racing games takes only a second or two to do), Smashing Toys has to reload the level, a process takes more than a minute on a system with a state-of-the-art Core i7 processor and 6GB of DDR3 memory. That just sucks what little fun there is in the game away.  Now, with load times this long you'd expect the visuals to amaze you. However, Smashing Toys looks dated out of the gate; the textures looked washed out and the environments are rudimentary. Ramping up the detail settings sends the frame rate plummeting without doing much to improve the visuals. The game does spend a lot of CPU power showing off physics effects; the tracks are cluttered with cardboard boxes, barrels, and traffic cones that you can send flying upon impact, though slamming into a barrel doesn't do much to affect your overall speed. It's a physics tech demo at best. The audio has basically two components: engine noises and some electric guitar that alternates between atmospheric soothing melodies and more energetic, driving segments.",

        "Content": "Two years ago acclaimed British developer Criterion took a stab at one of Need for Speed’s most established imprints: Hot Pursuit. The results were fantastic; it was a game that pushed the arcade racer forward in new, exciting  directions, providing unprecedented levels of connectivity, and was a major shot in the arm for the series. Thankfully, following on from the disappointment of last year’s entry The Run, Criterion is back in the driving seat, turning its perfectionist’s gaze towards another title from the franchise’s past. This time it’s Most Wanted receiving the makeover and the results occasionally approach the sublime. The first thing that impresses you about Most Wanted - and there are many highlights to choose from - is the sheer quality and craftsmanship of the game. It’s evident in most aspects of the game. It’s been constructed with a fastidious attention to detail. You’ll emerge from winding tunnels into blinding light; flecks of dirt and blades of grass will cling to the screen should you choose to go off-road; the music quality will dip and static will accumulate on your Sat Nav when you venture underground; the warm sunlight skims off rainwater that has pooled on the uneven, cracked tarmac. They’re all little touches – testament to time and energy – but when they all combine, as they frequently do, the result approaches something quite sublime. And you’ll still be able to appreciate it all tearing down the highway at 150 miles per hour. You get the impression that Criterion is rather proud of its achievement. Each race is prefaced by an introductory video, which showcases the city it has built from the ground up. Some are surreal vignettes in which police cars fall from the sky or perch on the ceiling of car parks like flies; others are snapshots of the city itself, showcasing its urban beauty. Things in the distance don’t bear up to the same scrutiny but it’s a more than acceptable tradeoff, since every side of Fairhaven – every sewer and flood drain, bridge and road – is accessible to you right from the beginning, without a single intrusive loading time. This is open-world gaming at it’s most seamless. Different sections aren’t crudely welded together with lengthy loading times. You’ll only be pulled out of it when you change cars, enter a race or switch to multiplayer and it never takes more than a few seconds. But this is a driving game of course, so inevitably it comes down to the cars. And in keeping with its sandbox aspirations, you're able to drive nearly every one of its 41 vehicles right from the start, from the mundane Lancia Delta to the most desirable Aston Martin V12 Vantage. To drive them you don’t have to win races or accumulate points or buy tokens; you just have to find them. Some are hidden on rooftops or down back alleys; some are hiding in plain sight. When you find a new car it’s equipped with stock components: basic tyres, a basic chassis and transmission, and no nitrous exhaust. You upgrade your car by accumulating Speed Points, which you earn by transgressing the law, setting off speed cameras, bursting through billboards, evading the police. But the fastest way to net some serious Speed Points is by entering street races. Each car has five races open to it, ranging from easy to hard. The races themselves are fairly varied: there are straightforward circuit races, sprint races and Speed Runs, in which you’ll have to maintain an absurdly-fast average time while weaving in and out of traffic. Place well in the races and you’ll receive perks such as off-road tyres, a reinforced chassis (so you can burst through roadblocks), or different gear sets, depending on whether you want a higher top speed or faster acceleration. Modding is easily done via Easy Drive, the game’s persistent on-screen menu. It lets you upgrade your car using the D-pad, change your car and set a route to new race. It again furthers that open-world feel. Criterion is smart enough to know that nothing is more antithetical to the open-world experience that it’s trying to create than drilling down through a series of static menus. In addition to straightforward races, there are also Ambush events in which you’ll have to evade the boys in blue. Part of the fun of Most Wanted is antagonising the authorities. Initially you’ll feel restricted to the roads and highways of Fairhaven, but the races show you different sides to the city. There are two ways in which you can lose the fuzz: keep on running for the horizon and hope they can’t chase you or break the line of sight and hide under a bridge, like Ryan Gosling in Drive. But police interference isn’t limited to Ambush events. They’ll get involved in most races, attempting to ram you off the road or into oncoming traffic; dropping stingers right in front of you; or blocking entire intersections. As your ‘Heat’ level increases they’ll employ faster cars to chase you down and even call in SWAT teams. And this is where your mods can give you a slight advantage – if you need to plough through parked SWAT vans or SUVs you must equip a reinforced chassis and the powershot exhaust, otherwise your car will crumple on impact. However, modding on the move isn’t all that easy and the risk of crashing into an obstacle while trying to change to re-inflatable tyres isn’t really worth it. And while Kinect allows you to access Easy Drive more easily, during the fast-paced races of Most Wanted it’s still a bit of liability to mod mid-race. The spectacular is well within reach of even the novice in Most Wanted. Cars handle brilliantly. Once you master drifting and how to use nitrous bursts effectively, you’ll be competitive in most races. Harder races aren’t intimidating with practice and a range of mods unlocked. Slow and steady won’t win you races in Most Wanted; only insanely fast and audacious will. Races in Most Wanted begin not from a static racing line, with you patiently waiting to hit the gas, but from a rolling start – you’re furiously thrown into the middle of the race and that’s pretty much emblematic for the game itself. The opening credits end with an invitation – a robotic-sounding woman’s voice says, “What happens next is up to you.” And that’s part of the game’s central weakness. It provides so much freedom that some will find it rather aimless. When you can drive and upgrade a Lamborghini Gallardo right from the beginning, the motivation to do it all again with a hatchback quickly evaporates. Some many of its pleasures are immediate, not rationed nor deferred. Saying that, there is a very loose narrative of sorts: you’re tasked with becoming the city’s most notorious racer. When you earn sufficient Speed Points you’ll be able to challenge one of Fairhaven’s ten most wanted racers. They drive the most desirable cars in the game – from the real-world Bugatti Veyron to fantastical concept cars – and the races are akin to boss fights, periodically testing your skills and knowledge of the city’s streets. (Incidentally, each race is preceded by the most stunning introduction.) Beat them by successfully take down their vehicle and you’ll take their car as a prize. It’s the main incentive to keep on racking up those Speed Points. That incentive is bolstered by the game’s approach to multiplayer. You’ll be able to drive around a private version of the city with friends, smashing into each other with Ballardian glee, or run through ‘setlists’, which comprise of races as well as challenges – who can make the biggest jump or execute the longest drift, and so on. It’s a lot fun and, as with the main game, it’s all seamless and flowing. Events are linked by mini-races as players attempt to get to the starting point before the rest. But if multiplayer isn’t your sort of thing Criterion has subtly woven competition into the very fabric of Fairhaven. Billboards will carry the face of your friend who burst through it at a higher speed, for instance. It’s subtle but very effective.   The Wii U version of Most Wanted is a very faithful port of the original. So if you want to tear around Fairhaven, becoming the city’s most notorious street racer, this version is as good a place to do it as any.  Criterion's touted that they’ve been able to bring to the PC version’s enhanced textures to the Wii U, (thanks to the available 1GB of RAM compared to the 512MB available to Xbox 360 and PS3). The truth is I was hard-pressed to notice the difference from the existing console versions. It looks great, but isn’t a noticeable step up. Likewise, it's unimpressive that Most Wanted U includes the first piece of DLC – the Ultimate Speed Pack – as part of the package. Despite the exciting title, it’s a superficial expansion at best. It adds five extra cars, 25 new challenges, and 70 more milestones.  The real extra content that distinguishes this version from its peers comes from the integration of the Wii U’s GamePad. It’s used in a variety of ways, some of which work better than others. The ability to use the gyroscope to steer cars, for example, is really more of a disadvantage in such a high-speed racer. It’s just too crude and imprecise to be much fun.  Far more curious is the Co-Driver mode. Criterion has said it’s their attempt at giving Most Wanted a more \"Nintendo feel\" – they even refer to it as the ‘father and son’ mode. It’s a type of asymmetrical co-op: one player's in charge of driving the car, using either a Wiimote or Pro-Controller, while the second player mans the GamePad, granting them near god-like control over key aspects of the game. With a simple tap of the touchscreen, the second player can take control of car away from the other player or instantly turn day into night. The GamePad also shows a more expansive, detailed map, allowing them to direct the driver toward places of interest, such as jack spots or challenges.  The GamePad is much more powerful than that – it can also remove other vehicles from the roads and even make police cars spin wildly out of control. Another tap can fix badly-damaged cars, removing the satisfying challenge of finding a garage in the middle of an intense race and trying to thread your car through it at 90mph.  Despite the magnitude of these powers, the second player’s role is really little more than that of an overseer. They can choose to be benevolent, increasing road visibility and removing oncoming traffic, but such is their lack of real involvement, it’s far more likely they’ll use these powers for mischief.  It’s worth stressing, however, that this extra functionality is optional, not obligatory. Players who want to enjoy Need for Speed: Most Wanted in its original form can do so on Wii U, but having what is effectively a cheat mode so close at hand might prove too irresistible for some.  Considering the extent to which GamePad has been utilised, it’s all the more puzzling that the Easydrive menu – how you select challenges and mod your car on the move – doesn’t take advantage of the hardware. The D-Pad is still used to cycle through various submenus. It’s a real shame since this interface – which has to be used so frequently – could have really benefitted from the use of a touchscreen.  While these new additions may have imbalanced Most Wanted U in some respects, they’ve also created a sandbox of greater possibilities and accessibility. One of the recurrent criticisms Most Wanted received on its initial release was its lack of structure – nearly all of its delights are there to be enjoyed right away. I found myself driving around for hours, achieving very little. It was frantic and desultory, but it didn’t really matter since the abiding experience was so much fun. Most Wanted U is perhaps the most capable version of that sandbox, giving players more control of the environment and objects within it, but in the process it may have removed some of the challenge that also kept you coming back to the streets of Fairhaven.",

        "Subtitle": "A time-looping investigation with (almost) as many murders as minutes.",
        "Subheader": "By Matt Purslow Updated: Sep 21, 2022 12:24 am Posted: Sep 13, 2021 12:01 pm",
        "Content": "I’ve never played a game like Deathloop before. More accurately, I’ve played a lot of games that are a little bit like it – Dishonored , Hitman , Outer Wilds , and even Dark Souls among them – but never anything that fits so many interesting ideas together to create something so fascinatingly unique. Its ever-repeating day, doomed to loop until you can break it by murdering eight targets, is a playground for impactful gunplay, absorbing investigation work, satisfying experimentation, and even tense multiplayer standoffs. Developer Arkane Studios ’ precise calibration of these pieces make Deathloop an intricately built clockwork machine that doesn’t so much quietly hum, but rather confidently roars. Your eight targets, known as Visionaries, have taken up residence on Blackreef; a cold and grey island made appealingly vibrant by dashes of 1960s fashion, architecture, and technology. Awakening every morning on its freezing shore is your protagonist Colt, a consistently amusing and understandably sweary gunslinger whose amnesia prevents him from knowing how he got here or for how long he’s been looping. Surprisingly for the scenario, there's no ticking clock snapping at your heels as you try to end the cycle by taking all your targets out before the day resets and they’re all resurrected. Deathloop’s smartest decision is to split its day into four time periods – morning, noon, afternoon, and night – and you can remain in each of them for as long or as short a time as you’d like. You choose one of Blackreef’s four unique districts to visit in each period, and you can take your time to thoroughly explore and crack some of Deathloop’s most elusive optional secrets without the fear of time running out. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That’s not to say there aren’t complications, though. Your targets are spread out across those time periods and locations, so much so it’s initially impossible to kill them all before the day runs out. As such, you need to herd them together so that you can murder more than one at a time. To achieve this, you must conduct an investigation into their lives and schedules that took me roughly 20 hours, uncovering Blackreef’s exciting secrets, learning fascinating details about your adversaries, and eventually concluding by orchestrating a satisfying solution that ensures every single one of them dies before midnight strikes. Despite using a “live, die, repeat” structure, it’s best to think of Deathloop as a temporal metroidvania rather than anything close to a roguelike. Its chief currency is information: as you chase down objectives and unearth new leads, you’ll discover clues that help you to unlock doors and exciting new opportunities in areas you’ve previously visited, both in time and space. Those areas are, in Arkane tradition, intricately detailed and dense with personality. The decrepit Karl’s Bay, with its cavernous, rusting aircraft hangars perfect for staging ambushes in, is home to an obsessive cult that devoutly follows one of the Visionaries. The sleeker Fristad Rock, meanwhile, with its rock ‘n’ roll club filled with tempting off-limits chambers, provides a fantastic challenge for your infiltration skills. Thrilling discoveries come as you begin to recognise the cause-and-effect connections between times and districts. “ Excitingly, the details of the four locations shift depending on the time you visit them. As the day goes on, the island becomes increasingly anarchic as its residents grow rowdier and smash up furniture, graffiti walls, and even crash a car into a building. In the afternoon, a snowstorm redecorates Blackreef with a white blanket, while the evening is host to an exuberant party that dominates the Updaam district. Between these big visual changes are subtle, more meaningful alterations, such as changing enemy patrols, water freezing to provide new pathways, or a secret apartment window that only opens in the afternoon. These changes help create a constant sense of discovery all throughout Deathloop’s day. Once you’ve played through all four time periods, the day resets and you start again. Dying will also send you right back to breakfast time, although Colt’s supernatural abilities allow him to survive death twice per time period, which keeps things fair and provides an opportunity to quickly learn from mistakes without things getting frustrating. Either way, each reset also strips your inventory of every weapon, power, and upgrade you’ve picked up, forcing you to start afresh each day. Saving you from despair is the Infusion system, which allows you to permanently bind items to Colt so that they survive the loop. It requires spending Residuum, a resource found around Blackreef which is rare enough to force considered purchases, but in enough supply that each new loop will consistently bolster your arsenal. This system cleverly encourages you to vary your approach, allowing you to taste Deathloop’s many flavours without committing until you’re ready. Each day involves picking up a new assortment of guns with varying perks from the enemies you chew through, as well as upgrades called Trinkets, by the bucketful. Trinkets, of which there are dozens, allow you to make meaningful alterations to both your weapons and to Colt, such as the ability to reload in an instant or move without making noise. The loop’s cycling buffet of options allows you to discover and test new equipment, which will go on to inspire your Infusion choices. My increasing enamourment with supernatural abilities such as the Force push-like Karnesis, for instance, saw me invest in Trinkets that increased how long I could use them for, and even fuel them with my health should I run out of power. Over time, you’ll build up a collection of your favourite items, from which you choose a loadout before heading into the next location. Deathloop screenshots 35 Images While you may lose equipment at the end of a run, a reset never disrupts your investigation – you hold onto every single discovery you’ve made so far in your quest log and intel files. This means you rarely have to repeat the same activity twice, which eliminates a frustration many other time-loop games suffer from. Discoveries automatically set new objectives, which unfortunately robs you of the chance to draw your own conclusions but does ensure you’re never exasperated by hidden links. It’s a worthwhile tradeoff that keeps Deathloop moving at a lively pace. There’s a genuine sense that each choice you make helps narrow the search, inch by satisfying inch. “ The journey your objectives take you on frequently shines a new light on locations and time periods you’ve visited before, which builds up a rewarding bank of knowledge. You gradually learn shortcuts through buildings, safe havens with health dispensers, and treasure troves that refill with the same violent delights – punchy weapons or even reliable sources of Residuum – every day. The most thrilling discoveries come slowly but surely as you begin to recognise the cause-and-effect connections between times and districts, such as when I realised that breaking into a computer in the morning will ensure a door in a different district will be unlocked in the afternoon. After a couple of hours of linear introduction (which do spend a little too long in a tightly controlled tutorial mode), the whole island and time loop is opened up to you to explore as you please – any district, in any order. You are provided with starting leads for each of the eight Visionaries, which unfold as linear quest lines, but how you pursue them is entirely up to you. You could opt to tug on each new thread as you find them, hopping between leads to cover as much ground as possible in a single loop, which provides a gratifying sense of efficiency. Or you could chase down a single lead, skipping time periods and locations in dogged pursuit of a specific part of the puzzle. This remarkable freedom helps fulfill the investigator fantasy; there’s a genuine sense that each choice you make helps narrow the search, inch by satisfying inch. Since most people on Blackreef are more interested in killing you than chatting, the answers to Deathloop’s murder puzzle are largely discovered in the classic formats of audio diaries, notes, and computer messages. Granted, those are a dime a dozen in just about every game since BioShock , but Arkane has outdone itself here: these are the best I’ve experienced in any game; concise, deeply flavourful, and often surprisingly funny. Via the aggressive messages sent by “AlphaWolf69”, for instance, you’ll quickly learn that one Visionary, Aleksis Dorsey, is a frat boy scumbag whose only rightful place is at the business end of your shotgun. Directly tying objectives to these diaries and messages means each new discovery further develops an authentic antagonistic relationship between you and the Visionaries as you play, rather than having a manufactured one dropped in your lap. Arkane’s deft storytelling hand doesn’t always hold entirely steady, though. If you don’t fully absorb every note and connect the many dots yourself, which is highly possible given the amount of freedom you have, Colt’s personal story – a fun, twisty history that intertwines with the lives of his targets and acts as Deathloop’s overarching plot – might not quite come together. And without it, the short concluding chapter can feel not just abrupt, but rather thin. As much as I appreciate Arkane having confidence in us to make these connections ourselves, Colt’s story feels like something that should have been served up in small milestone meals throughout the loops in a way that can’t possibly be missed, rather than scattered like cookie crumbs across the world to be overlooked by those who just want to get on with the next justified murder. Shotgun Symphony The precision engineering of this complex, looping world is held in balance by Deathloop’s combat system, which is a delightfully raucous affair that roars like a dragon with ballistic breath. If you prefer to go loud you can paint the walls with the insides of Blackreef’s violent thugs – all of whom appear to have fallen out of an Andy Warhol painting – using a small but well-tuned array of fantastically heavy weapons. Among the best are the Pepper Mill, a sputtering machine gun that feels as if it were wrenched from the undercarriage of a fighter plane, and The Fourpounder, a pistol that fires with the force of a battleship’s cannon made miniature. Despite acquiring these trusty favourites, I constantly found myself switching between the entire armoury as I planned around different tactics. If you’re playing on PS5, as I did, each gun produces a different effect in the DualSense’s triggers and haptic vibrations, generating a deeply enjoyable sense of force with every fight. These guns are joined by a library of Slabs, which are supernatural powers stolen from the corpses of Visionaries. These can be used in combination with your weapons and the environment to approach situations in your preferred manner, and all routes feel robust no matter if you choose to go loud or quiet. Pairing the teleportation Slab, called Shift, with the invisibility of Aether, for example, allows you to zip up to the rafters and observe enemy paths unseen, picking off stragglers with a silenced nail gun. The Karnesis Slab, meanwhile, can be used to levitate groups and repeatedly slam them into walls until there’s no life left in them. Adding to the Slabs’ value are upgrades, such as the ability to chain your teleport with a kick that’s so powerful it causes a sonic boom – which are acquired by looting the same Slab multiple times. This provides a strong reason to revisit your targets over and over to claim their Slabs, should the hilariously brutal neck-snap melee kill not be enough encouragement. The right combination can create a whole new playstyle. “ The links between your weapons and powers make Deathloop’s combat (or avoidance thereof) a hotbed for joyful experimentation. The system truly comes alive, though, when you learn how Trinkets can harmonise the individual components of your loadout. The right combination can create a whole new playstyle: you might become a hands-off hacker capable of remotely locking down rooms and take out targets with gun turrets that heal you with each kill; or perhaps a master navigator who can double-jump up onto balconies and magically switch places with enemies; or a telekinetic tank with ocean-deep ammunition reserves and a health bar that never seems to run out. This has a deck-building appeal to it, as you mix and match your inventory to craft kits tailored for delightful shootouts, sneaky infiltrations, or a hybrid of the two. Over time, you’ll develop a character build refined in anticipation of the final, perfect loop. How you you like to play games like Deathloop, Dishonored, and Deus Ex? Loud and aggressive Sly and sneaky No alarms, no kills Hacking Other (tell us in the comments) Answer See Results Does that sound too easy? There is, of course, a catch. Doing her best to ensure you never make it as far as the final loop is Julianna Blake, the only Visionary who ever takes a direct interest in Colt and operates on his level. She constantly chats with you over the radio, and your boisterous banter with her imbues this complex, mechanical game with an endearingly human personality. “If you don’t try to break the loop,” she taunts, “I’m just going to kill you over and over again in increasingly violent ways until you do!” Colt breaks her off; “Fine! I’ll break your f***ing loop, and whatever I did to p**s you off, I’m sorry!” It’s said with such comically coarse delivery that Colt instantly proves himself a worthy antithesis to the largely silent protagonists of other Arkane games. Combat is a delightfully raucous affair that roars like a dragon with ballistic breath. “ But the biggest difference between Julianna and her peers is that where the other Visionaries will only get aggressive if you invade their home turf, Julianna is a restless and free-roaming hunter. She’ll seek you out and crash your investigation party, turning up like a miniboss fight out of the blue. For example, after silently killing my first target and all their guards, I turned around to find Julianna inches from my face, blocking the exit in a moment that called back memories of BioShock’s terrifying dentist. The ensuing shootout – taking place in a hangar rapidly filling with lethal gas – threatened to send me back to the morning without any of the cool treasure I’d scooped up that day. Julianna’s enhanced aggression, resilience, and ability to disguise herself as generic enemies means she’s a welcome tangent in Deathloop’s predictable and repeating patterns. She’s not quite as dangerous as she sounds – I only actually died by her hand during the earliest stages – but the alert music that signals her arrival in the area nonetheless drums up some genuine tension every time. That’s the case in single-player mode, at least. Julianna serves a greater purpose, in that she can be controlled by another player who can “invade” your game to try to thwart you. This twist on the PvP mechanic popularised by Dark Souls turns her into an entirely different beast. Naturally more intelligent than her AI stand-in (or not, I suppose, depending on the person you’re playing against), a ‘real’ Julianna provides a more authentic sense of cat-and-mouse to the proceedings. This chase is a thrill that not even the few lag spikes I encountered could dampen, and a challenge that turns the ability to replay the loop after the credits have rolled into a much more alluring endgame scenario. Thankfully, if you detest the sound of a randomer jeopardising your perfectly arranged kill, invaders can be entirely locked out of your game, or limited to just friends, with the simple flick of a menu switch. Every Modern IGN 10/10 25 Images From the other perspective, playing as Julianna is similar to controlling Colt, but she has a different rhythm. Without Colt’s resurrection ability, every wrong move could be your last, and you’ll need to kill your target three times to ensure he’s dead for good. It’s a balance that initially seems unfair, but eventually reveals itself to simply be a different kind of battle. Deception becomes the key part of your toolkit; there’s a quiet thrill in switching appearances with an NPC and blending in, doing your best to replicate an AI patrol route (not unlike Watch Dogs ’ multiplayer mode). The map knowledge you’ve learned over many loops helps pinpoint ambush locations in places you’ll know Colt is likely heading to, which is a gratifying reward for mastering Deathloop’s level design. My apologies to the person who I repeatedly toyed with in the rock club, invisibly stalking them using vents I’ve discovered on multiple visits to stay two steps ahead. Also see: IGN's full Deathloop Walkthrough Encouraging you through repeat invasions is a ‘Hunter Rank’ progression system. This can be increased by completing challenges, each of which prompts you to kill Colt in a variety of fun ways. Success unlocks a rapidly growing collection of weapons, powers, and Trinkets for Julianna (she and Colt do not share an inventory), a wardrobe of new looks for both playable characters, and further challenges to complete. PvP is by no means an essential mode, but for anyone as similarly taken by Deathloop’s combat as I am, it’s essentially a rewards system for killing in smart ways.",

        "Title": "Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z Review",
        "Subtitle": "Zombie problems",
        "Subheader": "By Scott Butterworth Updated: Sep 18, 2021 12:20 am Posted: Mar 18, 2014 9:18 pm",
        "Content": "Historically, Ninja Gaiden games have always demanded a lot from their players. Mastering the fast-paced action and overcoming the powerful, relentless enemies requires patience, practice, and no small degree of skill. Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z – while more of a loose, arcadey spin-off than a true sequel – maintains this tradition, but unlike its predecessors, it’s difficult for all the wrong reasons. While its tongue-in-cheek humor and flashy, cel-shaded animations save Yaiba from complete disaster, the combat is so deeply unbalanced that the overall experience mainly just gave me a rage-induced headache rather than a satisfying challenge. Yaiba turns the tables by challenging you to find and kill Ryu Hayabusa, traditionally the series’ star, during a full-on zombie outbreak in modern day Russia. Franchise fans might be wondering why our hastily introduced protagonist (the titular cyborg ninja Yaiba) hates Ryu so much...or why we’re suddenly fighting zombies...or why we’re in Russia, of all places, but the plot basically just glosses over all this. The justification seems to be, “There are zombies, and you’re a ninja. Just go with it!” To be fair, many of these questions are eventually addressed in some way before the seven-mission campaign ends, but the awkwardly abrupt opening feels more like a failure to adequately set the stage than a deliberate attempt to create an air of mystery. Still, once you swallow the clunky exposition, it’s much easier to accept the mindless action game approach – a format Yaiba wears well. It earnestly embraces the silliness of slicing comic book-y zombies into bloody bits, providing plenty of colorful character banter, weird enemies like zombie clowns, and even some borderline adorable cutscenes starring the zombies themselves. It’s cheeky and charming, which helps make the repetitive “clear area, walk through door, clear next area” structure a little easier to tolerate. The classic combo counter (complete with booming voice-over guy) doesn’t hurt either. Beneath this jokey exterior, however, there’s trouble brewing. It’s not obvious at first. Initially, Yaiba’s button-mashy melee combat – though not as nuanced or precise as you would expect for a Ninja Gaiden game – is entertaining in that flashy, superficial way all button-mashy action games are. Who doesn’t like swinging a sword at stuff and watching it go splat, right? All too quickly, however, the lack of depth actually creates some serious gameplay problems. I could routinely rip through 30 to 40 smaller enemies at once without breaking a sweat, but as soon as I reached a higher-level opponent, Yaiba’s puny little sword suddenly chipped away only tiny slivers of health. Meanwhile, some of the more obnoxious mini-bosses could wipe me out in as few as two hits. In other Gaiden games, you’re given ways to save yourself in these situations. You can cycle through weapons to find the ideal match for the enemy type you’re facing, use ranged weapons to manage spacing between you and your opponent, heal at any time using potions, and even throw in some magic when things really get out of hand. You have none of those options in Yaiba. There are no ranged weapons, no potions, and no magic. Yaiba’s limited arsenal – a sword, robot arm, and flail – correlate to light, heavy, and area attacks, but don’t offer enough strategic variety to save you from the inexhaustible supply of attacks higher-level enemies possess. The crude melee weapons you can rip off of opponents (which quickly break) and barebones upgrade system provide a few helpful boosts, but ultimately, neither ever truly tipped the odds back in my favor. In theory, enemies who use different elemental attacks can be pitted against one another to create destructive reactions, but in practice, this rarely worked either. At one point I actually starting digging through the in-game index hoping to find some technique or ability I’d forgotten about, to no avail. Feeling unfairly disadvantaged is aggravating on its own, but the fact that I was skipping merrily through carnage town just moments earlier magnified the frustration every time I hit a wall – which, starting at around the fourth level, was all the time. It turned what might’ve been a short game into an agonizingly long one, with certain fights taking upward of an hour to get through. Again, this is from a guy who appreciates the fair challenge of previous Ninja Gaiden games. The essence of the problem is that no matter your skill level, you’re at the mercy of Yaiba’s design. For example, most lower-level enemies can be “executed” at the end of a combo, causing them to spit out some health. So if during a boss fight there are no grunts around to harvest for health or you lack the energy to initiate Yaiba’s rage mode, your only option is to restart over and over until you can eventually grind through the encounter. Of course, that’s assuming you can even tell what’s going on with the pulled-back camera and constant enemy area attacks obscuring the view. More than once, I actually lost track of Yaiba in all the chaos. That’s really not supposed to happen. Oh, and don’t even get me started on enemies who can literally teleport out of a combo and start firing lightning at you from across the arena.",

        "Content": "The PlayStation 2 occupies an interesting middle ground for multi-platform developers right now. It's obviously not in the same league as the HD systems and it can't hang with the Wii from a pure hardware standpoint, but it's far closer to Nintendo's system than the other next-gen offerings. Rather than trying to port down, though, some devs (like EA) are instead opting to create a slightly different version of the game for non-HD systems. It should come as no surprise that the PS2 version of NASCAR 09 , then, isn't really the same game as its PS3 cousin.  Luckily, that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's actually rather decent -- in much the same way last year's game was -- but if we dinged the game last year for being largely unchanged, then it's going to go double for this entry, which is even less improved over previous years. We bemoaned the loss of the Total Team Control mechanic that let you jump between cars and shook our heads at the game's middling four-player online offering and surprise! It's all identical.    In fact, about the only change I really noticed this time around (beyond the smiling visage of a dreamy Jeff Gordon, who pops up all over the place and serves as the game's tutorial guide) is the inclusion of EA Sports Family Play, which strips the game down to the most basic \"push X to go\" mechanics, swaps out the physics and controls to make the game dead simple for anyone to play and generally just dumbs things down to make it as accessible as possible. Normally I'd say this is a good thing, and for someone who doesn't quite understand the intricacies of, say, football, a streamlined approach is probably nice. With NASCAR, though, the basics are pretty easy to grasp right from the get-go, and it tends to make the game too simple for its own good.  One of the bigger reasons for the game's appeal last year was the infusion of light RPG elements -- or skill points if you're looking for the exact vernacular. By following a set number of disciplines like proper drafting, overtaking cars, intimidating them and racing cleanly, you'll earn skill points that can be used to upgrade your racer and his ride. Skill points can also be burned to rewind time a bit to correct a massive error. There's a fixed amount of temporal chicanery afforded per race, but it's a fairly nice little tweak to things if you're a stickler for, y'know, not slamming into a wall at a couple hundred miles an hour.  Part of me wants to delve back into the details surrounding your upgrades, but I could just as easily copy and paste in things from last year's game. They're that similar. I do want to make it clear that I certainly like the idea of being rewarded for racing well and being able to pour the points earned from skillful racing into upgrades or earn new sponsorships, but I enjoyed it last year far more than this time around because, well, it's the same thing all over again.  The ability to earn medals for each of the game's tracks that in turn unlock bonus content is a nice little touch too, though it's clearly set up to allow for grinding. Four silver medallions can be earned for lapping 5 cars, passing 20 more, finishing the race in first and finishing without tapping into your ability to rewind time. You'll have to earn all four silvers to unlock the gold, so there's a fair amount of replay value, but that also assumes you're a fan of a whole lot of left turns.    If nothing else, the game doesn't shy away from allowing you to tweak the hell out of your car. Gear ratios, downforce, suspension, tires and weight can all be tweaked to allow you to squeeze hundredths of a second off your lap times. It sounds like a minor thing, but upgrading your car often means that tweaks to gear ratios or weight shifts are necessary to squeeze the most out of bumps to the car's top speed. It's the kind of thing clearly made for gearheads, but at least the game offers a constant set of information bars to indicate how those changes will affect overall stats.  It typifies the kind of rigorous attention to detail and minutia that goes into NASCAR races, which is why the Family Play option is even more puzzling. NASCAR's appeal -- beyond watching massive pile-ups that are as deadly as they are fun to watch, of course -- is in how a particular driver manages to harness their machine and push it to the limits of what both it and the driver's skill will allow. In video game form, however, these things don't always come through, and what does survive the translation becomes less and less thrilling when such baby steps are taken to improve things.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the game's visuals. Just as they were last year, the aliasing and flicker while running the game in interlaced mode are distracting and constant (though the latter is at least improved by running the game in progressive scan, which it prompts you to do when you first start the game). Slowdown hits whenever you ram the other cars, and if possible I think the game actually looks a little worse than last year despite having almost identical menus and races. For some reason, the physics in the game seem less realistic, with slips and fits not quite as prominent this time around.  Though NASCAR 09 supports Dolby Pro Logic II, it's really only something you'll be able to appreciate while watching replays. The drone of car engines during normal races just doesn't quite have the same pop, and the odd bit of chatter from the pit crew or your fellow drivers attempts to liven things up, but by and large it's just aural filler.",

        "Subtitle": "Off-Balance Load",
        "Subheader": "By Dave Rudden Posted: Jan 2, 2015 9:30 pm",
        "Content": "I thought Loadout could have been PlayStation 4's equivalent of Team Fortress 2; a colorful, light-hearted, arcade-style, free-to-play shooter with crazy customization. Unfortunately, too much of Loadout weighed on me. When I didn't spend real money, the experience was too oppressive. When I started playing with money, there were still some unforgivable issues in the way matches are set up. As far as third-person shooters go, Loadout is decent in terms of gameplay. Character movement is floatier than most shooters, but I got used to the pace within a few matches. The speediness of the combat was the bigger challenge to acclimate to; scopes are nearly useless, and headshots are a rarity. I did appreciate the abundance of arcade-inspired damage indicators, though – between giant glowing numbers and loud chimes, I always knew when I'd hit my mark. There are both a co-op PvE campaign and PvP competitive matches in Loadout (both are always team-based and max out at four on four). The campaign and its bare-minimum backstory is a series of 50-plus matches against an AI-controlled aliens, each carrying stipulations given by unseen characters. A military commander will need help with enemies twice as strong as usual, an arms dealer will want some kills with a certain weapon, or a director may want a few headshots for gory movie footage. A simple character portrait would have done wonders to give them personality, but all we get are a few sentences of mission-select screen text. Fortunately, the guns got me excited for battles when the mission setup didn't. The weapon-crafting system is insane, as each weapon type has at least seven customizable parts, from the trigger to the scope. I was able to make some pretty powerful and fun weapons, though there's some trial and error involved. For every hit, like my full-auto Tesla beam that spreads through groups of enemies, I'd usually find another that looked good statistically and performed decently during target practice but fell flat in combat. Even with the duds, I enjoyed tinkering with my guns. I can't say the same for Loadout's attempt to infuse its characters with personality. They’re are actually more fun dead than alive - getting limbs shot off or faces removed (leaving an eyes-only visage reminiscent of Assassin's Creed Unity's launch glitches) is fine, and the overwrought death animations are better than motionless fatalities. They're also better when you earn a rare costume item instead of buying into the glut of high-priced tchochkes. Fortunately, I wasn't enticed to spend, since much of Loadout's customizable items trade in crude humor. For some folks, giving the busty, big-boned “Helga” character the “Fattoo” skin, thong underwear, and a twerking taunt might elicit a chuckle, but it just came across as trying too hard to be outrageous. The bigger issue is that while the campaign match types are completely randomized, stipulations aren't matched to complementary modes. In many cases, that led to stipulations completely incongruous to a match. A level with a stipulation asking for a number of rocket kills would be perfect for a \"find and capture randomized points\" mode, but usually I'd get thrown into something completely different at first like Death Snatch, where the Kill Confirmed-style rules wouldn't allow me to fire up-close rockets at enemies. There’s no option to repeat a match type, either, so a lot of the campaign's strategy is \"wait until a compatible match pops up.\" Since progression through the campaign requires both a victory in battle and completing the personal objectives, I had many frustrating experiences of letting my team down while just eking out an ultimately meaningless objective, or setting aside my personal gain for the team, knowing another long match laid ahead with the same stipulations. That isn’t a fun decision to make. While Loadout isn't impossible to play free, I did have to do an insane amount of prepping and micromanaging to stand a chance without paying. Apropos to its name, there's only a single loadout to manage when you start, and while that may have been beneficial to learning the ins and outs of weaponcrafting, the prohibitive cost of purchasing a second slot made for awkward rounds where I brought the wrong weapons to battle and had to debate between ditching my team or spending the next 10 minutes with a losing strategy.

I went from barely winning missions, maintaining a K:D ratio of 1.5:1 and rarely earning match MVP awards, to a team-carrying monster with double-digit killstreaks. In a way, I preferred the free experience – while it was much more of a grind early on, I feel way more accomplishment with a hard-fought victory than I do rolling over the opposition. Even when spending, I was often frustrated by missions requiring a certain ammo type that I ended up purchasing, only to reward me with a bounty of said ammo type. When it came to the PvP multiplayer, it was nice to see that the equalized levels made money less important, and limited the pay-to-win feel to the co-op corner. However, outside of the more robust choices available when playing an invite-only match, the standard public matches are sparse when it comes to options, putting the mode to a vote and randomizing everything else. The underappreciated \"Jackhammer\" mode, where one team defends a giant crane while the other attacks it, almost never wins public vote, and I wish there was a way to find a match besides corralling friends.",

        "Content": "The Old Hunters is as fitting a title for this self-contained Bloodborne expansion as you might imagine. It’s a spiritual and mechanical return to the old, reliable, tense, and violent patchwork of terrible places that make up this atmospheric and secret-filled world. With a sizable, 15-hour hunk of the same gory experience, it maintains the brutal attitude that defines Bloodborne, set in a new nightmare, against new horrific oddities, and with new grin-inducing weapons and abilities. This Hunter's Nightmare houses three distinct, sprawling, comfortless environments, that are as visually and thematically unique and fully realized as any area in Bloodborne. “ The Old Hunters largely takes place in a capsule-world called the Hunter’s Nightmare, a facsimile of Bloodborne’s world that's surprisingly even more stark and forgotten. It's a place where all hunters that succumb to the lust of the hunt eventually go – or something. The story is as vague and cryptic as ever, centered primarily on the curse that began with the first hunters, but The Old Hunters' self-contained plot delves as much into the established lore of the universe as its own story ideas, which are generally creepy and intriguingly peculiar, though not as grand in scale as Bloodborne's larger story of brushes with mind-destroying cosmic deities. This Hunter's Nightmare houses three distinct, sprawling, comfortless environments, that – with the exception of the starting area – are as visually and thematically unique and fully realized as any area in Bloodborne. This realm is fittingly lousy with fallen hunters – and unlike in Bloodborne, most of these dangerous enemies respawn, meaning constant, grueling encounters every step of the way. But in keeping with the hunter-centric themes, some of the most notorious names of the profession can be summoned for aid in both new and existing fights using the Old Hunters Bell. I beckoned Damian of Mensis to once again take down the cosmic Ebrietas, and I called upon the old Tomb Prospector to help in the deeper Chalice Dungeons. Knowing the place these names have in the lore meant lending a sense of validity to the world when seeing them in the flesh. This emphasis on hunters is paired with the new titanic, sickening, and deadly monsters The Old Hunters introduces to Bloodborne's bestiary. Whether you're facing blood-soaked sacks of decapitated heads, tentacles that whip violently when you get to close, or a towering shark-man that lunges dozens of feet to pick you up and bite down on your torso, there's new stress, fear, and elation to be had in each introduction. The Old Hunters' new beasts are a testament to developer From Software’s continued excellence in creature design. And yet mechanically, they’re inescapably familiar in form and function to what Bloodborne threw at us. Though undeniably challenging, it’s disappointing that these new encounters are challenging in the same way. Even the few new bosses introduced in The Old Hunters carry a strikingly similar cadence to what we've seen before. Their attacks never truly surprised me, and in at least once instance I was able to kill a boss on the first try due to its near identical look and behavior to the bosses of Bloodborne. The Old Hunters is an expansion that plays it very safe. Though undeniably challenging, it’s disappointing that these new encounters are challenging in the same way. “ Fortunately, the lust for coveting new instruments to murder, mangle, pulverize, and pepper with bullets is alive and well in The Old Hunters. Its niche weapons and abilities are as stylish as they are slaughterous and each new discovery rekindles that fleeting, perfect moment of excitement and wonder as to what it’s capable of doing. There’s a dark sense of catharsis in mowing through a crowd with a buzzsaw on a pole, firing a giant explosive artillery shell, beating a hunter to death with the arm of a cosmic deity, or summoning a giant viper to engulf your foes. The Old Hunters is an exercise in finding new ways to harm the horrors that lurk in the darkened corners of the world. However it's the many secrets in The Old Hunters that are calling me back to it even now. A cryptic phrase, an overly specific item description, or an obscure request: all are potential clues in the vast network of secrets gnawing to be discovered. For example, I found a new set of equipment, read its description, and learned it once belonged to a pair of hunters from an existing area in Bloodborne. On a whim I donned the armor and followed the clues, going to the area and exploring for... something. Moments before I was about to give up, admit that this was just wishful thinking, and that there was nothing to find, I met one of the hunters. These moments of reading into vague secrets, putting hints together and taking shots in the dark for things might not exist, culminate in exhilaration for those few times you're actually onto something. That payoff of turning over every nook and cranny is what keeps bringing me back to this world.",

        "Content": "As videogame visuals have evolved over the years, so too have game mechanics. 2D platformers gave way to 3D platformers, fighting game button inputs have been tightened and first-person shooters have jumped from the stiff constraints of Doom to the breathtakingly slick combat of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. But a good number of modern games have regressed back to the classics in an attempt to revitalize the retro mechanics that gamers grew up with. This can be seen in games like Bionic Commando Rearmed and Everyday Shooter. Generally, I appreciate developers that return to the basics in order to create an enjoyable gaming experience, but not all retro mechanics are good mechanics.   Class of Heroes is a perfect example of this.  A \"first-person\" RPG set in a fantastical world filled with labyrinths, Class of Heroes is built upon the classic dungeon-crawlers of years past. But RPGs have taken incredible steps forward in the last 10 years and Class of Heroes seems to disregard those steps. The game embraces the mechanics of a formula that is so old and so bland that I could barely force myself to trudge through the game's dark dungeons. Every time I turned on my PSP, it was a serious exercise in willpower.   Behold: the monotony of battle. And yet, I know there is an audience for this game. There are still pockets of hardcore RPG nuts that thrive on seeing their stats increase over countless hours of grinding. But I need more.  There's not much of a story in Class of Heroes, because the aforementioned dungeon-crawling is really the only thing to find in the experience. A new academy for adventures, Particus, has opened its doors and you take charge of a new group of students that yearn to explore the world and its many dungeons. Although you're given a set of characters to start with, you can expel them all and start from scratch (After selling all their stuff, of course. Bonus!). Because your only interaction with the characters is viewing their single, static character portrait, it's a shame that there are so few customization options available from the start. Although you'll unlock more characters down the line, there are 10 starting races and each race has two genders to select. So, there's a total of 20 characters to choose from. Once you name them, pick their gender, race, alignment and divvy up their bonus attribute points, your ability to control their appearance ends. You can't even change hairstyle, eye color, body type or any of the other typical character traits that usually come with RPG character creation.  The Particus grounds serve as your main hub of the game, where you can edit your party, buy equipment, recover at the Dormitory/Infirmary and accept quests. All this is menu driven, so don't expect anything more than a dull list of locations.  Once you accept a quest, you can enter into a dungeon (often referred to as a \"labyrinth\") and you're given a first-person view of the environment. From then on, it's all grid-based as you move one square at a time through dark corridor after dark corridor. When you encounter an enemy, static sprites will pop up in front of your screen and your command menu will be brought up in the lower right corner of the display. You never actually see your characters fight -- their portraits are just lined up on the left and right edges of the screen. You'll simply assign their actions one at a time and execute them all at once, which includes some incredibly lackluster attack animations that are often repeated from move to move.   Time to get oriented. I was surprised at how little the game tells you at the beginning of your adventure. Although you're presented with a very brief orientation on Particus' facilities and some of your initial quests explain certain elements of combat, I still found Class of Heroes to be a bit convoluted. Newcomers will undoubtedly find themselves lost or uncertain as to where to go for accomplishing a goal, as map designs are seemingly repeated in some of the labyrinths. For a game with such straight-forward battle mechanics, the rest of it is surprisingly unclear.  Oh, and I have to point out one more gripe: why do you need to pay to rest at the Dormitory? You can recharge your MP for free but recovering HP costs a lot of money. But if you can just use spells to recover HP and then rejuvenate your MP at the dorms, what's the point of charging that gold? The developers just added an extra (and very annoying) step to recovering from battle that I just can't wrap my head around.",

        "Content": "American Laser Games arcade titles like Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog McCree II and The Last Bounty Hunter were not good games by any stretch of the imagination. Terrible acting, lousy production values, and – thanks to the limiting laserdisc technology – totally repetitive gameplay are just some of the problems with these 15 year old arcade games. They were completely dumb back in the day and to see them again a decade and a half later just amplifies their silliness. However, they were definitely guilty pleasure experiences: it wasn't hard to plunk down 50 cents to shoot third rate rodeo stuntmen in the face. The Wii version is a near accurate emulation of the three original arcade games, and even though the trio of games are dreadfully cheesy, it's almost worth the $20 pricetag to make fun of the awkward acting and stupid plot.  Mad Dog McCree kicked off the series for American Laser Games, and it's clear that the production was done quickly and for very little money. The company gathered up a camera crew and headed for a historical reenactment village, and filmed a bunch of footage that's turned into a shooting gallery. The laserdisc allowed the designers to quickly swap out the video track so that when you \"shot\" the bad guy it would jump to the footage of him keeling over. Limited technology, but it did the job. Of course, the experience is tainted (or enhanced, depending on your perspective) by poor actors, awful direction, and video quality that would look bad even in an 80s porno. You can tell that the budgets got bigger and the directors got more confident with each game, but even with The Last Bounty Hunter the production values can't even match late night Cinemax flicks.  The gameplay in all of these games is nothing more than a real life Hogan's Alley: shoot the bad guys, don't shoot the innocents. The use of video is incredibly limiting – sure, you've got actual footage of cowboys and Indians running across the screen, but the video will never change. In some cases the pattern will switch around, but even in these instances you know there's going to be bad guys popping out of the same location, so you can just memorize the footage and prepare your aim before they get the upperhand.     For the most part, the Wii version accurately emulates the laserdisc versions. The videotaped footage looks about as good (bad) on the Nintendo console as it did on the laserdisc arcade  machine, the video compression comes off just a bit shy of DVD quality on Wii.  The original arcade machine used a light gun, and the Wii remote makes a pretty good replacement – the difference here is you've got an on-screen reticule at all times. What doesn't work is the game's \"quick draw\" mini-challenges where you have to point the remote away from the screen, then reload and shoot the single bad guy. In the arcade, the gun had a mercury switch that could tell when the gun was pointed down, and when pointed up it reloaded the ammunition. On the Wii, there's no motion sensing involved: you have to keep the pointer aimed away from the sensor bar. It's near impossible to do this on the Wii successfully the way it's intended. You can just cheat the system by aiming at the bad guy, cover the IR tip of the remote, and uncover it when you're allowed to shoot him. It's the only way I was able to pull these levels off successfully.  These games can be completed in about 15 minutes once you know where everything is, so don't expect anything deep, engaging, or a Wii game with any sort of lasting power with replay. Sure, you can go for the high score, and you can even have one, two, or three other players join in for some quickfire competitions. But once you've plowed through the dated footage there isn't anything more to see.",

        "Content": "In Greek mythology, Icarus’s ambition led to his literal downfall when he flew too close to the sun and melted his wax wings. So yes, being overly ambitious does have its drawbacks, but so too does a lack of it. Immortals Fenyx Rising, for instance, offers a light and entertaining spin on Greek mythology that’s clearly inspired by a reverence for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . Its setting, systems, and story are packed with references to iconic deities and legendary tales, but always with tongue planted firmly enough in cheek that it avoids coming off as self-important. All this flavour makes for a great set-up that’s complemented by fun combat, but the puzzle design across this colourful open world is disappointingly workmanlike. In a game about heavenly gods and fantastical monsters, the puzzles are far too grounded by earthly concerns. Immortals’ most inventive touch is its storytelling. The journey of Fenyx, a mortal soldier shipwrecked on a mystical island, is presented as a tale told by an imprisoned Prometheus to Zeus, and the dynamic between the two is hilarious. The pair’s bantering narration interjects regularly throughout your roughly 30-hour adventure, helping to further the plot, provide mythological context, or simply crack jokes. And further on, Immortals does an effective job of balancing the focus on humour with story-driven character development. The overarching story revolves around the hulking monstrosity Typhon, once imprisoned by Zeus, now free and determined to destroy the Gods forever. Typhon also interjects regularly as you travel across the Golden Isle setting, as he’s none too happy that you’re helping out the four gods this beast has transformed – Aphrodite, Hephaistos, Ares and Athena. And when I say transformed, I'm not embellishing. The God of War, for instance, is now a rather handsome rooster. The emphasis here is very much on humour, while also giving us insight into the backstories of Aphrodite, Hephaistos, Ares, and Athena within the pantheon. These iconic gods' stories are full of fun moments and amusing dialogue.I really enjoyed seeing how the development team chose to play with each of these iconic gods, and their stories are full of fun moments and amusing dialogue. Each of the areas they’re based in also feels radically different. The green hills, lush forests, azure streams and picturesque islands of Aphrodite’s Valley of Eternal Spring couldn’t be more different from the scorched, arid terrain and towering fortifications of Ares’ War’s Den. Immortals Fenyx Rising Screenshots 11 Images Hermes – emissary of the gods and all-round trickster – is also great value, popping up unexpectedly during missions, and always available at the Hall of the Gods , Immortals’ hub for upgrades and crafting. These are by no means the only characters of myth and legend covered by Immortals. Many of the puzzles, whether they're about restoring a Constellation or completing a Fresco are also references to classic fables, alongside other nods throughout the world. The dynamic between Zeus and Promethus is hilarious. Obviously the more intimately you know these myths and mythical beings the more you’ll get out of the references and the ways in which Immortals deals with them. I enjoyed the fact that the lives of the Gods are basically presented as a cosmic soap opera, but at the same time, a lot of it washed over me as I’m just not familiar enough with the underlying mythology. It would have been nice if Immortals had some supplemental information for players like myself that could help fill in the gaps along the way. The Gods are far from the only sources of humour in Immortals. Fenyx is treated quite playfully too, ensuring that even routine things like opening treasure chests or upgrading an attribute brought a smile to my face. The Best Open Worlds in Video Games 11 Images Far Slight The Golden Isle is a pretty alluring destination. Immortals’ painterly presentation can be quite striking as you gallop through lush meadows or take in the sights from a clifftop, while the day/night cycle ensures the tone of the landscape is always evolving. Fenyx is very capable within this world too; l ike Link in Breath of the Wild , he or she (you can choose) is able to climb basically any obstacle given enough stamina, then glide towards whatever destination you’ve picked out using the Wings of Daedalus. Exploration, though, is where Immortals stumbles a bit relative to its obvious inspiration. Fenyx’s Far Sight ability diminishes the joy of discovery somewhat, reducing it to a mechanical process of climbing to a vista, scanning the world, and marking out collectables and challenges – whether they’re visible or not. This takes a lot of the mystery out of the world. Immortals’ painterly presentation can be quite striking as you gallop through lush meadows or take in the sights from a clifftop... It’s one thing, after all, to climb a peak and spot something in the distance, then drop a pin on it to remind yourself to go and see what it is. It’s quite another to be able to systematically work your way across the entire map waiting for controller vibrations, then mark exactly what’s in that spot – be it a treasure chest , Vault of Tartaros or one of the numerous challenge archetypes. Every time I used Far Sight I’d typically add ten or more new destinations on my map with next to no effort. To be honest, I’d much prefer not to know what’s in that deep chasm before I jump down to explore it. And likewise, I want to climb a craggy cliff jutting out of the sea just to see if there’s something up there, not because I know for a fact a shimmering nugget of Ambrosia is waiting. The Golden Isle is fun to roam around, with plenty of optional combat and some truly impressive vistas.Of course, I don’t have to use the functionality, but to me the fact that it’s included at all says that Immortals is more concerned with the destination than the journey, and that was largely borne out in my time with it. While Immortals does use a stamina system for gliding and climbing, my plentiful supply of easily crafted stamina potions ensured that I could still quite easily get to wherever I wanted. As such, the environment itself wasn’t much of a puzzle, which is a real shame for an open-world game. Despite this, The Golden Isle is still fun to roam around, with basic collectables to gather and discover, plenty of optional combat, and some truly impressive vistas. Old’s Cool? Regardless, many of the destinations in Immortals aren’t what I’d describe as riveting once you reach them. It’s not that these challenges are bad – they just have no ambition whatsoever. That murky chasm I mentioned earlier? Turns out its deep secret was a puzzle where I had to shoot flaming arrows into three braziers to open a door. Then, 20 metres further along, I had to find three switches to open another door. Then a bit on from that, there was a puzzle where I had to find three weights to put on three pressure plates to open yet another door. I’m not even kidding. A large percentage of the puzzles in Immortals revolve around cookie-cutter gameplay like this. Immortals is grounded in pushing, pulling, lifting, stacking and throwing blocks… most of the time to trigger switches on the ground. That school of puzzle design is so old-school it makes the Greek myths feel practically contemporary. That school of puzzle design is so old-school it makes the Greek myths feel practically contemporary.It’s not just blocks and crates, either. I also had more than my fill of puzzles where I had to roll balls through mazes, guide flaming arrows into braziers or find the missing object to put on a plinth. One moment it’s an apple, the next a cabbage, but functionally it’s all the same. The puzzles in this game, whether in the overworld or within the Vaults of Tartaros, really do feel like they’re all just variations on a handful of basic concepts over and over again. Don't forget sliding block puzzles. To be clear, none of these are badly designed, and I didn’t actively dislike doing them. I just wasn’t excited by them, nor did they really test me or surprise me. Less would most definitely have been more in Immortals. Coming back to that chasm again, imagine if instead of three obvious and functionally similar puzzles there was just one that really rewarded observation and understanding its systems? I’d much prefer one satisfying puzzle that demands invention and lateral thinking than three utterly bland solutions. Instead, it feels as though the puzzles are largely there to fill the map, not to engage us. None of these puzzles are badly designed, I just wasn’t excited by them.Immortals’ puzzles are ultimately a means to an end – they’re a source of gear and loot that can be used to gain more stamina, unlock new abilities, upgrade potions and so on. And in this capacity they at least help ensure Immortals’ fast-paced combat stays engaging throughout. Which mythological beast would make the worst pet? Cerberus (so many mouths to feed) Hydra (pretty snappy) Cyclops (clumsy due to lack of depth perception) Minotaur (extremely bullheaded) Answer See Results Hammer Time Combat is absolutely a strength in Immortals, and the world map is positively littered with foes to fight, so any time I felt like letting off steam, some stylish hacking, slashing and wielding the powers of the Gods was never far away. I loved swapping my armour and weapons around to use their perks, as well as unlocking new abilities to give me more options in combat. Wielding the powers of the Gods was never far away.Taking a look at the skill trees, I largely focused on upgrading Fenyx’s ability to dodge in the air and on the ground, and then follow-up attack out of dodges. As is the way in video games, dodging as an enemy attacks slows time, and I took advantage of that by extending her sword and axe combos too. Alternatively, I could have focused on counters out of parries, or running attacks, or ways to do damage while airborne. I could even have ignored the skills altogether and gone all in on the Godly Powers. The Best PS5 Games 26 Images Instead of doing that, I chose to complement my chosen skills by giving my bird sidekick Phosphoros the ability to swoop down to damage and stun a target repeatedly, which was great for big threats. I also upgraded Hephaistos’ Hammer to give it a shockwave for crowd control in addition to burst damage. Whatever way you like to fight, Immortals will likely have something for you. Whatever way you like to fight, Immortals will likely have something for you.And as you help out the Gods you’ll also unlock their Blessings, each of which is a unique perk. Aphrodite’s Embrace, for instance, is essentially Mipha’s Grace from Breath of the Wild, bringing you back after losing all your health. Not that you really need it outside boss battles – there’s almost no penalty for dying on normal difficulty. The Best Games to Play on Xbox Series X|S 26 Images The combat is certainly fun, but it’s not particularly hard unless you decide to try and take on a legendary encounter before gearing up enough. For normal encounters it didn’t take me long to suss out each enemy’s attack patterns, as well as learning that if an enemy flashes red, I should get ready to dodge out of the way. Immortals has some good systems in place to help in combat too, such as icons showing when attacks are coming from off-screen. Again, get ready to dodge. Annoyingly, I found it impossible to consistently stay locked on to my priority target, so in the end opted not to use that functionality at all. The combat is certainly fun, but it’s not particularly hard.Fights could use a bit more variety, too. Sure, you’ll often be attacked by a motley assortment of enemies at once – a minotaur or cyclops here, a couple of ethereal soldiers there, a Gorgon slothing up behind, some Harpies in the sky, and so on. The problem is they don’t have a great deal of personality beyond their attacks, and aside from obvious counters like using heavy attacks against shielded enemies or aerial combos against flying creatures, you can use a pretty basic strategy against most foes – hit them until an attack is coming in then dodge. Rinse and repeat. Another element that makes the combat feel easier than it might otherwise have been is the fact that your health bar doesn’t really mean much. If you spend any time gathering collectable plants in the environment, you’ll always be able to cook up enough health, stamina, attack boost and defense boost potions that you can spend them very freely. Only Immortals’ final boss had me down to zero health potions and legitimately sweating. For everything else I was able to dose up as needed. Even so, I’m not opposed to combat that isn’t overtly challenging if it’s still fun, and Immortals’ combat is very much that. Fenyx is responsive to control and felt more and more powerful as I progressed. And after clocking Immortals, I was pretty tempted to either go back to my pre-final boss save or to start a New Game+ and try to max out all Fenyx’s gear and abilities… but then I remembered the gameplay in between the combat and the exploration. Ubisoft's Open Worlds Collide Wild fact: Immortals Fenyx Rising is Ubisoft's third open-world game to launch in just over a month. On October 29 we got Watch Dogs: Legion , which was followed by Assassin's Creed Valhalla less than two weeks later on November 10. That was only three weeks ago.",

        "Content": "The Xbox Live Arcade gods seemed to smile on both hardcore and casual gamers this week.  Bungie's pre-Halo classic, Marathon: Durandal, appeals to the former of the two groups, while the casual crowd gets Spyglass Board Games , a title which I refer to as \"Chess, Checkers, and Two Other Games You'll Never Play.\"  Ever heard of Mancala or Reversi?  I sure hadn't, but as the responsibility of reviewing the Spyglass compilation fell into my lap, I was eager to learn.  Unfortunately, the How to Play guide provided little help in my quest for casual gaming knowledge.  Checkers doesn't require too much of an explanation, the guide for Chess is rather detailed, but Mancala and Reversi get around three paragraphs each.  Considering that most players probably won't be too familiar with those game types, it would have made more sense to include a bit more instruction on how these games are played.  While learning these two alien game types in Spyglass's single-player mode, I alleviated my frustration by switching to a friendly and familiar game of Checkers on-the-fly with a quick press of the X button.  When I grew bored with that, I jumped into Chess, moved a few pieces, then switched to Reversi and struggled with that.  On-the-fly switching also extends into unranked Xbox Live games, which makes hunting down friends a good idea, as game types can be changed when one player or the other grows tired of a particular game.  Of course, the rather obvious Achilles' heel to this useful mechanic manifests itself in the form of anonymous online opponents who decide to swap games simply because they aren't doing well in one type or another.  I started a game of Checkers with an opponent who apparently grew aggravated at my superior skills, so he switched to Reversi.  I didn't want to play Reversi, so I promptly switched back to Checkers.  He switched, then I switched, and so on until he grew annoyed enough to simply leave the game.  This trend continued with an assortment of other players until I finally decided that learning the ropes online, even in an unranked game, isn't feasible too often.  Fortunately, Ranked games require players to choose the one and only game type that the match will feature.   You'll have about as much fun as these two. Even those players who are willing to shell out their Microsoft Points for nothing but Chess and Checkers will find themselves disappointed with Spyglass's lack of pizzazz.  There are no extra challenges, no in-game tutorials with which to improve a player's skills. You pay for Chess and Checkers, and that's what you get.  As most gamers would probably guess, Spyglass doesn't feature much in terms of flashy aesthetics.  The available game types--Checkers, Chess, Reversi, and Mancala--are displayed on a background that can be one of several colors.  Different themes are available for each game's respective pieces, and all game boards can be rotated to a number of vantage points.  That's about it, and really, not much more is needed.  Checkers is still checkers, regardless of whether or not the board is green and black or blue and pink.  The Xbox Live Vision Camera's inclusion doesn't hold any surprises, either.  I found myself looking at players' faces, living rooms, pets, and I'm sure there are gamers out there who will choose to display objects most commonly seen on adult websites.  A number of filter effects such as color reversal, a wavy underwater-like effect, and a jail cell border can be applied and switched on a whim by pressing the Left and Right Bumpers, but there isn't a wide variety.  The camera's inclusion in Spyglass feels completely tacked on, probably so that the screen looks a bit fuller; without those tiny video boxes, the playing field would look quite bare, especially in rounds of Mancala.  In short, the camera works just fine; it just doesn't add anything to the game.  At least the camera can be disabled if the filter effects grow annoying (and some of them certainly will). ",

        "Title": "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - The Bright Lord Review",
        "Subtitle": "Power Corrupts",
        "Subheader": "By Dan Stapleton Posted: Feb 24, 2015 1:58 pm",
        "Content": "When I play an expansion like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor’s The Bright Lord, I have to wonder if developers sometimes misunderstand what made their game so successful in the first place. In this DLC, Monolith goes out of its way to make up for the lackluster final boss fight in the main game by adding a challenging face-off with Sauron himself, but takes steps backwards when it comes to the reason I really loved Mordor: its dynamic uruk enemies that created countless mini-boss battles throughout the campaign. A flashback story puts us in the still-corporeal shoes of Celebrimbor, as Sauron abducts his family. We know how this ends, and there are no twists – just Celebrimbor and Sauron smack-talking like pro wrestlers for four or five hours as you take over the Undun section of Shadow of Mordor's map (again). The good news is that Celebrimbor’s combat style shakes things up. Compared to Talion, he’s much more about branding enemies stealthily or in bulk and building up an army, using his Shadow Brand ability to brainwash any enemy you can see, or his improved Wraith Flash to brand multiple enemies at once. You can even summon a posse of pre-mind-controlled uruks to your side at almost any time. Those are wildly powerful moves (and hordes of glowing-eyed uruks can take a toll on frame rates), but they're kept in check by the fact that Celebrimbor can't take as much punishment as Talion, so every so often you have to massacre them all to restore your life and start the cycle over. Archery takes more skill, too, because you don’t get the slow-motion effect when you draw your bow anymore, so it's way harder to headshot your way through a crowd of incoming uruks. But Celebrimbor is wearing The One Ring, which he can charge up by branding enemies and activate for slow-mo and infinite, unblockable execution moves for around 30 seconds. (And that's before doing any side missions to upgrade the duration.) The effect of this power on Mordor's memorable Captain and Warchief fights is completely ruinous. Even though uruks can now reach level 25, any fight can be won by simply activating the ring and mashing the execute buttons until it’s all over - their resistances are completely nullified. It’s the same ridiculous \"win-button\" mistake Warner made with Batman: Arkham Origin’s Shock Gauntlets, and here you start out with it from the beginning. Power like this defeats the purpose of combat and makes wins feel unearned, and I found myself avoiding using it except when I absolutely needed to. Also, The Bright Lord actually makes its Warchiefs and Captains feel less dynamic. You can’t kill Warchiefs, only dominate them, because they’re actors in the story. Meanwhile, there are no captains jockeying for position or advancing independently of your actions in the background, so there are no dynamic duels, feasts, or executions to interrupt. It makes the world feel static and scripted, which is a shame, because the behavior of those enemies is what I like best about the main game.

        "Content": "It's no secret that movies don't make the best videogames. Reasons vary depending on the title, but it's usually a matter of time. Specifically, developers simply don't have enough of it to make a quality product. Videogames based on movies need to hit the marketplace around the same time as the films themselves, so gamers usually wind up with rushed software. Even when movie-based titles have an intriguing premise, or even promising design, sloppy execution usually stifles any fun. Sadly, that's the case with The Da Vinci Code , based off the best-selling novel by Dan Brown. It borrows a riveting story of conspiracy and murder, yet gets bogged down by sloppy gameplay. It even has a few interesting mechanics here and there, but these feel underdeveloped and haphazardly thrown in, too.  Now, before going any further, just know there's a good reason why this game even exists. And it has to do with money. Lots and lots of money. The book and film made a ton of it. So, naturally, the need to keep things moving required the property to expand into the game market. To go even further, the reason why the book and movie made tons of cash is because they both told a good story -- a tale of murder, conspiracy, killer monks and 2,000 year-old-secrets about Jesus Christ. Just like in the movie, the game follows two characters, symbologist Robert Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu. You control them both, though not at the same time. Each behaves exactly the same in terms of combat and puzzle-solving abilities, and the game decides which one you control at any given time. The selection tries to coincide with the happenings of the book and movie, but it's not always spot-on. And while having two characters never hurt, it's mainly cosmetic here. It would have freshened things up a bit to have each character claim his/her own strengths.  You spend most of the game navigating museums, tombs and other environments in the third-person, fighting cops and solving puzzles as you go. The deeper you get, the more of the Da Vinci mystery you unravel. And while the story and overarching riddle do entertain, the actual gameplay needs serious work. First, the combat engine simply doesn't belong anywhere in this game. The book deals with an intellectual struggle, not a physical one. Well, not so much that you need to brawl with dozens of killer monks, anyway. Combat splits into two phases. The first one plays like any other third-person brawler, in that you can walk up to an enemy and start beating them by mashing on the face buttons. You do this until the game switches to phase two, which it does automatically. Here, you win or lose the encounter depending on how you play a mini-game. It's pretty basic, all you need to do is hit the right sequence of buttons before the timer runs out to pummel foes into oblivion. You're also given a choice at the bottom of the screen to throw enemies, which takes a simple button press. When the above system works, it's fine. A little dull, by fine and it doesn't bog the experience by any means. When it doesn't work, things go from dull and serviceable to broken and infuriating. For some cosmic reason, developers made the combat engine for one-on-one encounters, yet you continually face more than one person at a time. To finish the aforementioned mini-game sequences correctly, for instance, you need to push the right buttons in order, without interruptions. Only you get interrupted all the time in this game. Many encounters go far longer than intended -- all while you lose precious health. Making matters worse, the actual brawl mechanics feel clunky. There's almost nothing you can do from a defensive standpoint, so taking damage is entirely unavoidable. Most of the time, you simply stand in front of an enemy and take turns beating each other. No, this isn't a standard action game, but if you're going to include combat there needs to be a way for players to defend themselves. You can pick up poles and golf clubs as weapons, but it doesn't make fighting deranged religious folk any more exciting.  Puzzle solving fares a little better. Good thing, since that's what you spend most of the time doing. A huge portion of the story deals with ancient codes and ciphers, so it's no surprise most of the puzzles do as well. Many of them have you jotting down numbers and symbols and rearranging them to uncover messages, clues and the like. One such puzzle, which you encounter early on, has you decrypting ancient symbols hidden in the Mona Lisa. Taking what you learn from this puzzle, you then head off to another section of the building (the Louvre) to decipher another riddle hidden in another set of paintings. When not cracking codes, you'll gather an array of items for your inventory to solve other \"real-world\" enigmas, such as how to open a gate or door, or how to evade the cops. Most of these don't take much cerebral fortitude, though. For instance, whenever you need to combine items you'll rarely have more than a handful, so it's almost always clear as to what items go together. Thankfully, the game doesn't feature too much backtracking, as puzzles and their requisite items are usually located nearby. Convenience aside, these puzzles simply aren't that engaging. Here's a quick example, set early in the game so as to not spoil anything: in order to get rid of a GPS transmitter you find in your jacket, you attach it to a bar of soap from a bathroom and chuck it out the window. Two items and almost no thought involved. And that's how things go for most of the game. At times, it feels like a genuine old-fashioned adventure game. But these moments don't last long. And it's not because the puzzles don't offer any fun, because they do, it's just that none of them really soar. Most come off as either too simple, or worse, too obscure. Most fall under the easy category, though, so the game won't take all that long to complete. Unfortunately, the game's presentation doesn't do much to save it. Character models don't animate very well, though it's no so bad as to cause retinal bleeding. Textures could be a little sharper as well. Some of the environments do offer a nice bit of detail, though, but these instances only pop up from time to time. The soundtrack is much better. It's fitting -- moody, atmospheric and decidedly creepy. It's the right kind of music for slow-paced puzzle solving. But again, there's not much of it. ",

        "Content": "Considering how popular the Cthulhu mythos has been in recent years, it’s a cosmic mystery why it took so long for the venerable Arkham Horror board game series to get its first video game adaption. That makes it even more of a shame that Arkham Horror: Mother’s Embrace gives it such a middling digital debut. Its particular take on Lovecraftian horror feels faithful in the details, but uninterested in challenging some of its own troubling preconceptions – or even being very scary. Couple that with soft ball puzzles and pushover combat encounters, and this dark ritual feels largely harmless.  Mother’s Embrace is an adventure game structured like most Arkham-themed card or board games: you control a group of investigators who hop between Prohibition era locales like prestigious universities and old spooky buildings in search of clues. Solving the great mystery of a weird and wondrous force that threatens all of reality without being consumed by it yourself requires a balance of both physical and mental fortitude, but every move forces you to make tough choices that look to disrupt that balance – be it through bizarre mind breaking discoveries or brutal bone breaking confrontations.  Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace Gameplay Screenshots 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask  Your tale here is divided into “scenarios” focused on single locations and with a set of specific objectives, be it finding an old voodoo priest in New Orleans or investigating a mysterious murder in a fabulous mansion. In each of these chapters, you’ll stroll around the environment questioning the locals, collecting journals and notes, and investigating suspicious points of interest in order to piece together a solution to whatever problem brought you there in the first place. The overt nature of all these activities rarely makes you feel like you’re doing any actual detective work. You’ll find yourself simply stopping at every single highlighted area in hopes that it adds a clue to your notebook, making you more vacuum than gumshoe.  It’s not quite as simple as hoarding everything you find, of course. Many of these interactions have more than one way to navigate them; should you pick the lock on a chest or should you break it? In each array of options, only one is correct. Choose poorly and you risk failing the task, punishing you with a tick on the Mythos Clock, which hangs in the top right corner as a mechanical manifestation of existential dread. After five ticks, the clock strikes midnight, and the Old Gods send you a stern message in the form of combat debuffs, forcing sanity skill checks on the spot, or stealing items out of your inventory, to name a few. This adds an element of risk to searching a new location, but the consequences were never harsh enough to dissuade me from always giving each choice a shot.  Investigating means stopping at every highlighted spot, making you more vacuum than gumshoe. “  Depending on the investigators in your party, you may not have to pay the cost of failing them at all. Each one has their own specialties – scientist Kate Winthrop excels when tasks involve searching, while Federal Agent Roland Banks knows his way around logic puzzles – and will drop a hint pointing towards the right answer when these complex interactions arise. Their strengths are best treated as random bonuses though, as there is no indication of the kinds of interactions you’ll encounter in any given area, and therefore no real way to plan a party composition around succeeding at them with any regularity.  Where party organization really matters most is when the snooping stops and the shooting starts. The Baldur’s Gate 3-style turn-based tactical combat revolves around the various ways your sleuths can spend action points to take down foes like cultists and weird tentacle creatures. Guns, melee weapons, and magic come in amusing assortment of shapes and sizes, all of which require a certain amount of the five points each character gets per turn to use. This cost is dependent on the weapon each investigator is using, but also their proficiency with that weapon type. A gun that takes parapsychologist Agatha Crane four points to shoot only takes three for jazz trumpeter and apparent crack shot Jim Culliver, for example.   This didn’t affect my strategy going into most combat scenarios, though. So long as you have ammo, guns are usually the best option no matter the wielder. They do great damage from far enough away that the largely simplistic and dull enemies rarely pose a threat. Towards the end of the campaign, if you’re thoroughly checking every corner for possible goodies, you’ll have more consumable healing items and ammunition than you’d ever reasonably need against such unworthy opponents. The only real worry is instead the aforementioned Mythos Clock which ticks with every combat round, serving to make the rare tough encounter a bit more ferocious, but not enough to make them any more interesting.  So with maintaining the body being a fairly simple task, managing sanity proved to be the biggest challenge in Mother’s Embrace. You take sanity checks on a majority of interactions you make, tests of your investigators’ mental fortitude that will harm their mind if they fail. Some of these checks seem reasonably disturbing, like coming across a dead body resting on a glyph drawn in its own blood. However, many of them instead stretch your suspension of disbelief a little too far – why would the fibers of my mind be fraying when I read that a body has gone missing from a graveyard in the newspaper?  Guns are strong enough that the largely dull enemies rarely pose a threat. “  If any investigator’s sanity meter drops to zero then they gain a trauma, a debuff that cripples them permanently (or until you let them rest at your headquarters between scenarios). Each investigator has their own list of possible traumas, and as they pile up they can become real detriments. Those include things like a character having a lower chance to critical hit or even hurting themselves occasionally, making them more compelling threats than most of the other consequences in Mother’s Embrace.  But while I cared about keeping them operational, I didn’t really care about the investigators themselves. The seven different starting options (and five more you meet along the way) are made up of largely one-note caricatures, be it the somber gravedigger Will Yorick or the sassy dilettante Jenny Barnes. They have a reliable stock of puns and one liners, reacting as you’d expect them to based on their jobs and backgrounds with few surprises to make them standout. But outside of the little blurb that accompanies them in their stat screens or exposition that they dump on you the first time you meet them, these characters have no real arcs or compelling motives.  Which is WORSE for a Lovecraftian detective game to have? Bad combat Bad investigating Answer See Results  The story itself is a rote Lovecraftian murder mystery, one that would have benefitted greatly by breaking away from some of the genre’s unfortunate trappings in more meaningful ways. Mother’s Embrace’s inclusion of black protagonists and major npcs despite the eponymous author’s noted disdain for most people of color is a welcome step forward, but not a big enough one to also include a less harmful depiction of mental health issues and those struggling with them. Its depiction of patients in asylums lacks nuance, reducing them to either blubbering husks or violent monsters with little in between, and only serves to further isolate people in the real world who may suffer from non-Old One related mental illness. Even when the story is at its most serviceable, all the gore and intrigue of its gruesome events are taken at face value, with almost no examination of its themes for something deeper or as a metaphor for the human condition, as the best Cthulhu stories usually do.  But while the story itself is only skin deep, it at least looks great while telling it. Apart from some very generic animations both in combat and during exploration, the costumes and character designs really stand out and the use of color and lighting does a great job of setting the otherworldly mood, especially towards the end of its six or so hour adventure. You can replay Mother’s Embrace after your first playthrough with a new starting investigator as well, but there's not much reason to do so as nothing significant will change besides some dialogue.",

        "Content": "Kentucky Route Zero: Act 4 opens with a giant, robotic woolly mammoth perched on a boat, and gets stranger from there. The weirdness serves as a valuable storytelling tool, not a gimmick, and is tactfully employed to offset presuppositions we don’t even know we have. Though the imagery is fanciful, it opens the door to this short but excellent adventure game episode’s exploration of truly serious themes: the desperation of poverty, the nature of friendship, and the impending threat of death. A giant mammoth on a boat. In previous Acts, the subterranean journey down Route Zero has felt intrinsically rooted in the hill-and-cave country legacy of the Kentucky highlands: coal mines, distilleries, bad jobs, gospel music, poverty, apocalyptic spirituality, and mystical backwoods folklore wrapped in the twilight of magical realism. These elements are all still present, but Act 4 broadens the scope of the storytelling and embraces the rich, esteemed legacy of literature’s river stories. The journey down the Echo and the striking, somber encounters along the way seem inspired by an Americana as old as Mark Twain. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery and a renewed understanding of their purpose. Though I appreciated the tranquil and maudlin tones of Act 4, it’s the first episode in the series that didn’t scare me. It’s deeply consequential, but the de-emphasis on menace took a little away from the shadowy mystique that penetrates every aspect of the gloriously realized artistic vision. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery “ Playing Kentucky Route Zero is more like writing a novel than reading one. Character background stories are composed on the fly, chosen from a series of wildly divergent dialogue options that define the protagonists’ histories. When someone asked the orphaned boy Ezra if he’d ever been on a boat, I had the choice to define a deep, emotional memory of boats connected to his lost parents, relate a cursory tale about boats in cartoons, or decide that he’d never even been on a boat before. When playing Route Zero, you’re not just choosing where you’re going, you’re also deciding where you’ve come from. This tremendous flexibility feels just as empowering as any climactic action scene or iconic puzzle. There are no bosses to beat or puzzles to solve, but there are very high stakes. The Mucky Mammoth Like previous episodes in Kentucky Route Zero, Act 4 regularly places you in control of multiple characters in the same conversations, constantly shifting your perspective and control in discussions. There’s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene. The clean and simple interface kept this unusual dynamic from becoming confusing, and thanks to a clever script the constantly changing perspectives built up my empathy for the characters. There’s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene “ The carefully crafted dialogue alternates between things people might actually say and a tone more reminiscent of things they’re more likely to think. The effect fits the dreamworld state of the setting very well, but the thickness and constant existential awareness of the text might turn some players off. And then came wonderful, surprising moments where I suddenly lost control of a character and they stepped out (quite literally) on their own, autonomously making decisions that, whether coincidentally or by design, usually lined up with a behavior I would have chosen for them. These moments are few and far between, but when they happened they always made sense and added an air of comedic shock and genuine tragedy to the story. I happily discovered the sparks of independence made Conway and the other characters feel more like people and less like avatars and instruments of my will. Even when I disagreed with their choices, I respected them. Characters standing in the shadows. Act 4 is a short affair, easily completed in a couple of hours, but there’s a surprising amount of variety in the storytelling method during that time. Route Zero is mostly a game about people talking, and Act 4 keeps finding ways to reframe that mechanic. One creative party encounter was experienced entirely as a series of security camera video tapes viewed by people I’d never met, long after my party had passed by. Another was played out in a haunting, beautifully written river-raft tour through a subterranean wildlife preserve, and a third through the playful and thoughtful journeys of a wandering child capturing sounds on a handheld tape recorder. There’s plenty of standard walk and talk, but Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale. Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale “ Every stop along the river has something thoughtful or delightful to offer, but not every encounter is an absolute home run. The concert sequence offered me a chance to get dynamically involved in creating music, but much like Act 3’s interactive song sequence, the musical experiment here feels like it could have come together better with a little more tweaking. All these scenarios and portrayed in a lovely, minimalist graphical style that makes tremendous use of carefully chosen muted colors and shadowing to create a sense of surreality. The camera work is especially well implemented, with constant subtle zooming and panning that brings a sense of life and motion that’s unusual in adventure games. The simulated flatness of the art is so well executed it lulls me into forgetting the characters are moving through a 3D space, and more than once this is startlingly exploited as the perspective twists or zooms to reveal the layered reality of the setting. A roaring prehistoric beast. Thematically, the transition comes at a perfect point in the broader Kentucky Route Zero story, as our heroes begin the chapter in a meandering, listless wandering, and through their encounters along the river, their way toward surrendering to who they are, or changing to become who they want to be. As one character observes: “All people need is enough to pretend they’re home, and we can make it anywhere.”",

        "Content": "When I first reviewed Civilization VI back in 2016, here's what I had to say about it as I awarded it a score of 9.4 (for amazing) and nominated it for game of the year:  \"Civilization VI will go down in history as the most fully-featured launch version in the series. Many of those are smartly revamped versions of Civ classics, but it finds its own identity with great new ideas like spread-out cities, customizeable governments, research boosts, and leader agendas. And even though the AI has some improving to do, it can put up enough of a fight to make world domination a challenge.\"  Considering Aspyr has already successfully adapted it to tablets and, more recently, to phones, it’s no shock that Civilization VI works well on the Switch in handheld mode. All of the text is fully readable and the cartoonish art style works well on a small screen. Where it breaks new ground is in how the Joy-Con are used to control a complex 4X strategy game in either handheld or docked mode, and the Switch version works almost as well in that capacity. It definitely takes some getting used to before accessing of all Civ VI’s many menus feels natural, but the logic is consistent enough that if you’ve gotten into one you can figure out how to get into most of them.  I recommend playing in handheld mode at least to start out, because that gives you the option of using both the Joy-Con and – should you struggle to find which button gets you to the desired menu – touch controls, which let you simply poke the menu you want. Fortunately, Civilization is a turn-based game, which means you have all the time in the world (human history, even) to get the hang of it. Note that this version of Civilization does not include the Rise and Fall expansion that came out for the PC version earlier this year, but as far as I'm concerned that's okay. It does benefit from a number of bug fixes and AI improvements that resolve a few of the complaints I had in my original review. One catch with the Switch version is that in docked mode it tends to chug a bit as you scroll across even a modest empire, and naturally the amount of time it takes for your AI opponents is longer than it would be on a PC. But I do love being able to quickly put it down and pick it back up – that’s better than it is on a phone, generally, because of the fact that the Switch can’t be used to browse the web and check Twitter, which means that as long as you don’t start up another game and cause the Switch to quit out it’ll be lightning fast to jump in and play a few turns. As a side note, the proof-of-concept in these controls is pretty important because it means that it’s only a matter of time before Asypr brings Civilization to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, accessing a far greater audience than ever before. And everybody should play a Civilization game, at least once. [Update: Civ VI for Switch is missing one notable feature of the other versions: online multiplayer. You can still play on a local network. However, multiplayer Civ remains a cumbersome exercise.]",

        "Content": "There’s a kind of poetic irony in remaking a game designed to poke fun at the game industry, considering all the remakes and reboots already flooding shelves. To both its credit and detriment, Re;Birth1 carries that identity struggle throughout. Sometimes the in-jokes and references are spot on, while others fail to critique and instead repeat old mistakes. What could have been a new start for the series instead becomes a merely average role-playing game that just doesn’t fit together completely. It’s lighthearted, and sports some fun, giant-anime-weapon battles, but its lack of challenge causes it to grow stale quickly. The best part of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games is inarguably the concept: Four goddesses, each representing a different game system, are waging a “Console War” against one another in a cutesy, high-octane anime fashion. Following this idea, Re;Birth1 is filled with meta, fourth wall-breaking humor, and a good bit of charming self-awareness. Pretty much every character and party member you encounter along the way fits into some sort of anime or gaming archetype — Neptune, who represents the fourth (imaginary) console, is the high-energy, childlike protagonist, while Iffy is a smart tsundere who can get quite flustered at times — and Re;Birth1 actually does a good job of balancing character versus caricature. That's about where \"good balance\" ends, however. One cheeky addition along the same self-aware vein is the “remake” system, which changes aspects of dungeons like enemy difficulty and the types of items that appear. It’s good in theory (insofar as it’s self-deprecating), but in practice, it’s not all that fun to go through old dungeons again just to get new items. I didn’t think grinding was at all necessary, either, so “remaking” a dungeon to increase the challenge didn’t make a whole lot of sense. Grinding is made unnecessary, by the way, due to the relative ease of combat. It’s of the basic turn-based, open-movement variety, and I found it functional, yet underwhelming. The only strategy I really needed was to have my healer heal between attacks and kind of brute force my way through things, though a few harder fights were more satisfying. A partnering system that allows one party member to loan her battle perks to another while staying out of harm’s way adds another dimension to battle, but it’s not really necessary, and ultimately, it just made battles easier, not more exciting. The story and dialogue both suffer from the same identity problems that permeate every other aspect of Re;Birth1, being simultaneously irritating and endearing at times. If a monster was clearly too hard for the area, I realized it before the characters sassily pointed it out, and I don’t need a dozen mentions of the word “tsundere” to realize which characters fit the archetype. Again, the ideas were there, but they were either too shallow or too frequent, rendering them moot. But I also found it adorable and loved playing as a group of dorky girls, at least for a while.  Amazingly, Re;Birth1 passes the Bechdel test, which asks if a fictional work contains at least two named female characters who talk to each other about anything besides a man. The Bechdel test is imperfect though, and it shows here. Most of the girls’ conversations that aren’t about a man are about pudding or full of jokes, which is cute and totally fine; however, a good number feature forced, awkward sexual advances between the characters and comments about breasts, which was funny maybe once and quickly grew overplayed. It’s intended to satirize the same archetypes the characters are based of off, but it doesn’t do the job well. A common philosophy in humor and satire is that it should “punch up,” not down, meaning it’s better to make fun of those who enforce the status quo than it is to simply recreate the status quo in an exaggerated way. Re;Birth1 does this in places — there’s an enemy called “Super Otaku” and meta jokes about oversized weapons — but it largely fails, especially with its character designs.  To reiterate, I didn’t dislike the characters at all. But the panty shots and sexually charged conversations aren’t portrayed in a way that says, “We know this is ridiculously excessive and we’re laughing at ourselves because of it.” It’s obvious that they are imitating more “serious” media to make fun of them, but the mockery seems incomplete. Rather than a comment about breast size alone, for example, I’d expect a follow-up jab about people who see women as decorations or even a simple “It’s not my fault, I was drawn this way!” That would direct the satire, and therefore criticism, at the source instead of the result and make it, you know, actual satire.",

        "Content": "Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. And like all drugs, it can be dangerous to become reliant on it. Serious Sam, I think you have a problem and need an intervention. Sure, 2011’s Serious Sam 3 felt like a goofy throwback to a simpler time, but in 2020 Serious Sam 4’s brand of non-stop run-and-gun shooting feels downright archaic. It layers on a few new ideas like dual wielding and a skill tree, at least, but while Doom has reinvented itself for modern times, Serious Sam seems to revel in neither moving forward nor backward. It’s just kind of strafing to the side. For whatever reason, there’s a story that attempts to justify all the weird carnage you’ll cause, and it’s just as much of a jumble as the battles. We get a series of stiffly animated cutscenes in which Sam Stone and his military buddies fight to overthrow an alien overlord in Europe by… finding the Holy Grail, because why not? Sam’s voice sounds like he’s gargling liquid Duke Nukem as he and his allies rattle off an endless barrage of barely funny one-liners, constantly workshopping their comedy out loud. I love a good pun more than most, and this wore thin pretty quickly. Every once in a while a decent gag lands, but just as often the script will inexplicably turn completely serious with no punchlines to it and it feels bizarrely out of place.  The actual gameplay boils down to moving from one giant, largely empty arena to the next, each time fighting enemy horde after enemy horde with an arsenal of straightforward, mostly unimaginative weaponry. Three types of shotgun, and assault rifle and two miniguns, two sniper rifles, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher… almost none of it feels remotely distinctive. The only gun that feels like it has a real personality to it is the returning Cannon Ball, which is absurdly powerful and fires with different velocities depending on how long your charge up a shot, and if you just roll one out it’ll bowl over multiple enemies and roll around on hills. For such a zany game you’d expect a lot more crazy weaponry like that and fewer off-the-shelf firearms. The sheer variety of monsters you fight is insane in more ways than one. “ I will give Serious Sam 4 this much, though: the sheer variety of monsters you fight is insane in more ways than one. It’s a hodgepodge of dozens of different types, ranging from the most basic zombies and the iconic/obnoxious screaming headless kamikaze bombers to laser-packing alien soldiers, flaming mummies, galloping horned skeletons, weird little one-eyed beasts, scorpion-men with miniguns, charging werebulls, giant four-armed lizard-men, telekinetic witch queens, numerous direct Doom and Quake demon ripoffs, actual nosferatu-style vampires, and many, many more.  There’s certainly some spectacle to seeing a swarm of a hundred enemies bearing down on you, and it gets chaotic quickly. However, this menagerie doesn’t make any sense as a collection of enemies in a single game, ensuring that the Serious Sam’s universe never feels like a plausible place. Do you have a group of friends you play co-op games with, or do you prefer to go solo? My team leaves no one behind. Sorry, I work alone. Answer See Results  Most enemies just run at you and shoot, but a few have distinctive behaviors to counter and can combine to be especially lethal. Dealing with a swarm of flying drones that force you to look and aim up means you’re not watching the ground, leaving you a prime target for charging werebulls or kamikazes. What’s smart about it is that they pretty much all make distinctive sounds so you know what’s coming before you see it, which is essential because more can teleport in at any place at any time. Survival is all about juggling your guns to select the right tool for each target, whether that’s taking out a swarm of small enemies with a spray of bullets or bringing down a big one with concentrated firepower. Unlocking the ability to dual wield and hold a different gun in each hand helps a lot with that because you don’t have to switch between them as often and can double your damage output (it’s pretty satisfying to melt down a crowd with dual miniguns), but that comes at the cost of being able to use alternate fire abilities like zooming with the sniper rifle or using the powerful death ray attachment for the laser minigun. You can only reduce so many enemies to red mist before you become numb to it. “ You also occasionally get some consumable superweapons to break in case of emergency, such as a decoy that lures enemies away, time-slowing device, a portable black hole that sucks every enemy in range into oblivion, and… a syringe that restores 50 health. That one’s pretty boring, actually. The problem is that this is just about all the depth there is to Serious Sam 4, and thus its protracted battles become tedious – you can only reduce so many enemies to red mist before you become numb to it, even as more and more of them flood in with the next in a series of waves. For me, that happened at less than the halfway point in the campaign, and even the introduction of a new weapon or enemy only livened things up for a few minutes before settling into the same doldrums again. Serious Sam 4 screenshots 24 Images  Other than that, the only other things you do in Serious Sam 4 are a few terribly boring vehicle sequences, some of which are literally just driving on an empty road for a few minutes without so much as a sweet jump to go over. Sometimes you get to drive a big stompy mech with unlimited ammo, which is fine but simpler and less strategic than fighting on foot. But by and large it’s just massive brawl after massive brawl, some of which seem to refuse to end. I’m certainly not saying it’s easy. “ I’m certainly not saying it’s easy – playing solo in the first half of the campaign, the sheer amount of enemies meant a lot of these fights took me a few dozen attempts on normal difficulty. (For that reason it’s very difficult to estimate how long the campaign is, but I’d ballpark it at 12 to 15 hours.) It’s very inconsistent, though: some areas shower you with health and armor pickups, allowing you stay in good shape if you remember where they are when you need them, while others are bizarrely stingy with them. With no way to restore meaningful amounts of health yourself (an upgrade that gives you health when scoring a melee kill gives you an insultingly small amount), that left me restarting again and again basically trying not to get hit at all. It’s also counter-intuitive that the boss fights are actually some of the easier encounters – I never had to try those more than a handful of times. Without spoiling anything, the final boss fight introduces a couple of new mechanics that really should’ve been rolled out earlier. There’s more creativity in that one fight than in the rest of the campaign put together. The toughest fights are often found in the side objectives, which are clearly marked with signs that tell you exactly what reward you’ll earn up front.  It’s all just… fine. Challenging, absolutely, but uninspired and bland. However, there’s one area where failing to get with the times has really burned Serious Sam 4: there’s no drop-in co-op. You can -- and really should -- go through the campaign with up to four players, but you have to specifically load into a co-op game to do so. Many times I hit a fight that felt insurmountable and I wished I could call in a friend to help me through it, but that’s not an option. And it’s frustrating that co-op is so much easier simply because you can respawn into the action where you left off, whereas in single-player every death means reloading from a save. I was much less frustrated with the second half of the campaign than the first, and it was almost entirely due to playing with a friend. That said, it’s extremely odd that a game that seems so geared toward co-op is built around a single protagonist character, and everybody else simply vanishes in cutscenes. That’s the kind of general sloppiness found throughout Serious Sam 4, and it’s hard to ignore when textures are popping in right and left and animation glitches are so common.",

        "Content": "After the past three years of cryptic and confusing teaser trailers, the question on everyone’s lips has been, “What exactly is Death Stranding?” Well, now we know, and the answer is… complicated. The first game from famed designer Hideo Kojima since his dramatic departure from publisher Konami and his long-running Metal Gear franchise is a boldly inventive slab of sci-fi, fastidiously crafted to host to some of the most breathtaking sights I’ve ever witnessed in any medium – video game or otherwise. It’s also a cross-country crawl that frequently finds itself mired in an exhausting amount of inventory management, backtracking, one-note mission design, and unprecedentedly arduous travel . It’s evident that Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions have worked extremely hard to build Death Stranding, but it’s also painfully clear that they expect us to match their determination in order to fully enjoy it. The “Death Stranding” in question is the name given to a cataclysmic event that only small pockets of humanity, the Monster Energy Drink corporation, and an apparently universally accepted Facebook-style social status system have survived. Since the Death Stranding, natural wildlife has been wiped out and rain has transformed into “Timefall”, a deadly form of precipitation that instantly ages everything it touches. Lurking within each downpour are the BTs (“Beached Things”), paranormal entities who prey indiscriminately on survivors, leaving society confined to the safety of subterranean shelters. You are Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), a post-apocalyptic postman with a ghost-detecting baby strapped to his chest named BB who, like most infants, is as adorable as he is insufferable. Sam’s quest is certainly a compelling one; to reconnect the isolated remnants of civilisation by completing an endurance-testing sequence of delivery jobs from one city to the next, earning the trust of their citizens, and bringing them back online in the government’s “Chiral Network” as he makes his pilgrimage west across North America. Sam is allied in his pursuit by a quirky cast of characters with quirkier names like Heartman and Die-hardman, and opposed by Troy Baker’s wonderfully maniacal villain Higgs, who has an appetite for both licking faces and chewing scenery. Sam has additional motivation to undertake his epic expedition: his sister Amelie is held hostage by Higgs on America’s westernmost edge, a destination appropriately called Edge Knot City. What We Said About Death Stranding: Director's Cut on PS5 A long list of quality of life improvements certainly makes the PS5 Director’s Cut the most feature-rich and accessible version of Death Stranding. If you’re yet to experience its gorgeous vistas and general sci-fi weirdness and you’re not turned off at the thought of a 40-hour fetch quest, then this is the best way to enjoy its fiction with the least amount of friction. However, by giving us powerful new cargo-moving tools that allow us to forgo heavily burdened hikes in favour of walking the path of least resistance, it diminishes frustration at the cost of any sense of hard-earned gratification. This may be called a “Director’s Cut,” but I can’t help but feel that, for better or worse, the PS4 original perhaps more closely resembles the director’s vision. - Tristan Ogilvie, September 23, 2021 Score: 7 Read the full Death Stranding: Director's Cut Review Every IGN PlayStation First-Party Exclusive Review 239 Images If Death Stranding sounds like a series of glorified fetch quests, it’s because that’s exactly what it is. It’s definitely an intriguing story setup, but if you think that playing the role of a courier makes it sound as though Death Stranding could be one continent-spanning series of glorified fetch quests, it’s because that’s exactly what it is. The vast majority of its 70 main story missions are structured in the same way as the optional side missions we’ve all run in countless other open-world games. With the exception of certain tutorial missions which introduce the basics of the combat system, boss fights, and a handful of other combat-oriented diversions, advancing the plot in Death Stranding amounts to taking item X from location A to location B, over and over again. Sounds pretty repetitive, right? Well, the good news is that there are also side missions in Death Stranding. The bad news is that these side missions are also fetch quests, undertaken mainly to unlock additional items or customisation options. The Walking Dread What makes the repetitive objectives somewhat bearable is that the scorched landscape of Death Stranding is staggering in scale and rich in detail, to the point that initially I wanted to slow down and pore over every inch. And it’s just as well, because I wasn’t really given any say in the matter; the opening hours are so ploddingly paced that it makes the whole thing seem like a personal attack on the speedrunning community. We’re all accustomed at this point to walking through vast game environments carrying an arsenal of weapons and items – that’s a description that could define anything from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Grand Theft Auto V and just about everything in between. But Death Stranding turns that routine into a grueling exercise in frustration thanks to what is possibly the most aggravatingly literal inventory system ever conceived in a video game. With rare exception, every piece of cargo, weapon, ammunition and tool you pick up has its own physical presence on Sam’s body, and its own heft, all managed by an incredibly fiddly inventory menu. Of course, the concept of inventory weight limits in video games is not new or unique, and I’m traditionally a bit of a role-playing game packrat who’s prone to becoming over-encumbered and forced to shed superfluous items or stubbornly walk slowly back to town, on occasion. But Death Stranding takes that idea to exhausting new extremes. Not only does Sam’s personal inventory and cargo very easily become a comically oversized Jenga tower of flight cases teetering on his back, but it also makes the act of taking Sam for a short walk up a slight hill feel more like trying to push a wheelbarrow full of bricks up a flight of stairs. Taking Sam for a short walk up a slight hill feels more like trying to push a wheelbarrow full of bricks up a flight of stairs. Movement in Death Stranding is effectively the antithesis of the empoweringly fluid parkour of Assassin’s Creed or Marvel’s Spider-Man. Whereas in those games you hold a button to watch your athletic and nimble character effortlessly glide over objects and up and down vertical surfaces, in Death Stranding you alternate between holding the two triggers to maintain balance and wrestling with the thumbstick to keep Sam’s sensitive momentum shifts in check. The result of all of this effort is purely to walk a few metres up a gradual incline without him toppling over and scattering his painstakingly packed luggage rack like a boozed-up bellhop. Mercifully, there is an ‘auto-arrange’ option in the inventory menu to optimise where exactly each piece of cargo sits on Sam’s body, and once I’d discovered it I used it for absolutely every subsequent delivery, because why on Earth would anybody not? (The only time it backfired was when I was sent to literally deliver a pizza – the auto-arrange shoved the pizza onto my backpack sideways, thus ruining some poor bloke’s dinner.) Yet even with Sam’s load packed more efficiently, it doesn't entirely stabilise his toddler-like equilibrium should you take a false step or attempt to carry too much. Encounters with these spectral nasties certainly ratchet up the tension to survival-horror levels. Even after I had a grip of the overly stubborn movement controls, I still had to maintain a slothful stride at all times thanks to the presence of BTs in most of the many rainy areas of the map. Sam is initially defenseless against these supernatural enemies and must crouch-walk past with bated breath in order to avoid them. Encounters with these spectral nasties certainly ratchet up the tension to survival-horror levels the first few times around, turning otherwise unassuming dunes into scary Silent Hills, but they quickly become yet another of Death Stranding's many mechanics seemingly designed to cause the friction that slows your progress as much as possible. Hideo Kojima earned his legions of fans by allowing them to be a Snake. In Death Stranding, he’s asking them to be a snail. Strand and Deliver Things do pick up, though it takes a lot longer than I’d have liked. Roughly 10 hours in, during the lengthy third chapter, Death Stranding settles into its most consistently enjoyable rhythm. In relatively quick succession you’re given access to auto-pavers that can be fed resources to flatten out predetermined stretches of the landscape into smooth roads, along with the means to craft vehicles like a nimble reverse trike, a slow yet high-capacity truck, and a floating cargo carrier that also doubles as a nifty hoverboard. All of these help to minimise the hassle of getting from point A to point B, which of course is still what you’re doing almost the entire time. Every IGN Kojima Game Review 10 Images It’s here that combat, effectively restricted to stealth takedowns and unarmed fisticuffs up until that point, blossoms to become exponentially more dynamic. Weapons and gadgets are suddenly thrust upon you at a steady clip, and I found that Death Stranding’s Metal Gear Solid lineage became more evident once I began to infiltrate enemy camps, create confusion amidst the human highwaymen with smoke-based decoys, and use the non-lethal sticky gun to hilariously whip cargo right off their backs from afar like a frog’s tongue snatching a fly. Just as Death Stranding is threatening to become consistently enjoyable, the setting shifts. There’s a satisfying amount of nuance afforded to the combat tools as well. Take the bola gun: firing it to wrap around an enemy’s torso will briefly immobilise them as they struggle to eventually wriggle free of the cord, buying Sam a precious few moments to scurry into denser foliage or behind a rock to break the line of sight. Alternatively, if you fire a charged up shot at an enemy’s throat it will choke them out and leave them lying unconscious on the ground. Death Stranding’s combat doesn’t ever quite reach the same level of flexibility as that of Metal Gear Solid V, but it does introduce a much-needed sense of play amidst the monotony of manual labour. Mounting Frustration Just as Death Stranding is threatening to become a consistently enjoyable video game, though, the setting shifts and the story progress stalls once again, this time in intensely mountainous terrain where vehicles and road construction become impractical, human enemies are scarce, and BTs begin to lurk in snowstorms instead of scattered showers. By this stage I had unlocked the means to confidently tackle BTs in their monstrous form head-on, and there’s no question that each face-off against Death Stranding’s most imposing threats are a slick slice of pure, full-fat, Kojima-style spectacle. Allow Sam to be discovered and dragged down by the BT’s clambering shadow hordes which emerge from swelling pools of tar that form beneath his feet, and he’s suddenly sluiced on his back through the ooze and resurfaced in a landscape that has been completely transformed and inhabited by a muscular, physical manifestation of the BTs in a rising pool of bubbling blackness. It’s one of Death Stranding’s most stylish tricks and honestly an incredible sight to behold. Yet even when you do manage to scramble and take down one of these nightmarish beasts your victory is often insultingly hollow; your reward is typically a handful of crystals for crafting equipment, and the onerous task of manually fetching each of the dozen or so canisters you were carrying that were scattered when Sam was swept off his feet, one after the other. It feels like being declared the winner of a food fight, only to find out that your prize is a mop and bucket. Thus, fighting BTs is just another part of Death Stranding that soon becomes more trouble than it’s worth, causing anxiety as a result of tedium instead of terror, and as a result I reverted to avoiding them wherever possible as I patiently checked off each order on Sam’s seemingly never-ending list of deliveries. It feels like being declared the winner of a food fight, only to find out that your prize is a mop and bucket. One particularly torturous late-game story mission required me to carry a hefty weight on my back through a visibility-masking snowstorm and over near-vertical stretches of terrain. It took me 51 minutes to complete. Spending close to an hour schlepping heavy cargo through waist-deep snow, up and down mountains, constantly pushing against fierce winds, in a pair of shoes that wear out over time isn’t an enjoyable video game mission – it’s a lecture your parents used to give you when you complained about having to walk to school. At least in some of the lengthier treks like this Death Stranding will cue a licensed piece of music (a la Jose Gonzales' Far Away in Red Dead Redemption), which is nice to walk to, although honestly a podcast would have been far more appropriate. It is true that while vehicles are impractical in the mountains, on-foot traversal is gradually made easier via the addition of powerful exoskeletons and the ability to craft zipline structures. Yet while there is some satisfaction in systematically forging your own zipline trail up a particularly rocky escarpment (or extending partially existing ones), it's also somewhat deflating to finally get the medical supplies you're transporting to the summit only to be ordered to turn around and take some other kind of medical supplies straight back down again. Strand By Me But Kojima Productions’ willingness to experiment, for better or worse, is evident in all facets of Death Stranding, and its boldness is commendable. The asynchronous multiplayer component, known as “Bridge Links”, shows the effects of other players on the world without ever bringing you face to face with them. It’s a system designed to function in concert with Death Stranding’s major themes of connection, where ‘strands’ with other players are automatically cultivated and, as a result, the vehicles they abandon, structures they establish, or objects they drop all persist within the environment of your game and are free for you to make use of. This evokes a sense of unspoken collaboration, as weapons and building materials can be stored in special shared lockers in a sort of honour-based ‘take a penny, leave a penny’ fashion for other players to grab. I was particularly inspired by the cooperative way you can build, customise, and maintain structures like bridges and watchtowers. And, after finally crossing the breadth of the continent in the final stages, I was both surprised and delighted to revisit a stretch of road I had built some 20 hours earlier on the other side of the map to find that it had long since sprouted into a lengthy highway all thanks to the persistence of others. A stretch of road I'd built some 20 hours earlier sprouted into a lengthy highway, all thanks to the persistence of others. This hard work doesn’t go unrewarded, either, since doing good deeds for others – whether intentionally or not – can net you ‘Likes’, which is the currency used to boost Sam’s stats and improve his reputation with his customers. Likes are also what you receive for completing each delivery, in quantities apportioned relative to certain criteria such as your distance travelled, the damage taken by the cargo, and the speed at which you complete it. In fact, your mere existence in Death Stranding seems to net you a never-ending number of Likes, almost as though you’re the one Kardashian who managed to survive the apocalypse. But the Bridge Link system has its downsides. For one, it makes almost every one of Death Stranding’s major boss fights shockingly easy, since Bridge Linked avatars regularly pop-up by your side to keep you fully stocked with weapons and health-replenishing blood packs, leaving you overpowered and virtually invulnerable. Unwanted assistance aside, these bosses are merely surface-level cool; they look amazing but have fairly one-dimensional attack patterns and easily pinpointed weaknesses. Meanwhile, structures assembled by other players – while helpful at times – can just as often mislead, such as the many times I went out of my way to use a user-created zipline marked on the map to cross a wide chasm in Death Stranding’s mountainous area only to find it half-completed and inoperable, or climbed a ladder that went to nowhere. It’s true that you can log off from the Bridge Link system and play in a strictly single-player manner, but I wish the options were more granular – perhaps allowing you to toggle on the ability to share building resources but toggle off the cheat mode-style boss assists. Playing Death Stranding in its offline mode seems in direct opposition to what I perceive to be the deeper meaning of it all, and I’d hate to lose that even more than I hate the baggage that comes with it. I’m Still Stranding And yet despite all of my gripes I still found myself being pulled, albeit slowly, towards Death Stranding’s story climax. That’s mostly due to the sense of nobility that comes from rebuilding a fractured America, the pioneering spirit of finding out what, exactly, was over the next hill (even though more often than not it was just slightly larger hills), and the lure of uncovering the mysterious cause of the Death Stranding itself. The latter remained particularly tantalising, teased along the way by cryptic visions of Mads Mikkelson’s enigmatic Clifford and frequent communications with Margaret Qualley’s Mama. It almost went the distance, in fact, before tripping and falling into the prolonged exposition dump that is Death Stranding’s home stretch. I was sustained by consistently sublime artistry and ingenuity. Elsewhere, I was sustained by consistently sublime artistry and ingenuity, both great and small. There are imposingly large waterfalls and monolithic man-made structures, boss enemies big enough to go toe to toe with any of the 16 giants from Shadow of the Colossus, and an in-game weather system that allows you to predict rain patterns up to 30 minutes in advance, which is crucial in order to plot your routes to safely avoid BTs. IGN's Top 25 PlayStation 4 Games 30 Images Then there are the myriad minor touches. Like the way Sam can pick up and throw items with either hand, but his dominant right hand will always throw farther. Or how if you crouch to hide in tall grass you can still be spotted by an enemy if the luggage stack on your back is tall enough to remain visible. That’s not to mention all the cheeky fourth wall-breaking nods and winks you’d expect from the mind behind Metal Gear. When ads for actor Norman Reedus’s real-life television show appear splashed across the vanity screen everytime Sam uses the toilet, it’s clear that it’s Kojima who’s really taking the piss. It’s clear that it’s Kojima who’s really taking the piss. But Death Stranding is a bit like a frosted piece of glass; no matter how polished it may be, it’s still pretty dull. You really need to work incredibly hard to enjoy any of it, because so much of Death Stranding feels convoluted and requires far more effort than it has any right to. Take the fast travel system, for example. If you want to warp to another area, you need to slow travel to very specific facilities on the map, then hold a button to trigger a sequence of three different cutscenes showing Sam descending on an elevator to his private room, lying down to sleep, and waking up from sleep (thankfully you can hit pause on each of them to skip them), then finally pan the camera around his private room to find and use the teleporting umbrella which Sam is forced to keep hung on the wall of his private room instead of, oh I don’t know, carrying it on his back? It’s just a thought. Podcast Beyond: Special Death Stranding Review Discussion Episode Death Stranding has been, quite simply, the year's most divisive game around the IGN office. Some of us love its gameplay, others find it frustrating, and aspects some of us enjoy others find annoying.

        "Content": "Back during the days of the Game Boy Color, THQ released to the world Buffy the Vampire Slayer one of the worst games ever to hit the handheld. No question. That image certainly tarnished the hot killer of the undead, at least in videogame form, but it's a curse she's apparently carrying more than three years later. Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King is an original GBA design handled by a much more competent developer than her Game Boy Color outing, but the game is entirely dull and repetitive that captures almost none of the magic of the show. Even if you're a fan of the now-ended WB/UPN television series, you're only going to like it for the digitized stills of the cast.  Features  Sixteen levels Customizable weapons Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance Japanese developer Natsume's worked with THQ several times in the past on Game Boy development, most notably the never-ending Power Rangers handheld series. The development studio was put to task on recreating the look and feel of the television show in a playable Game Boy Advance production, but the end result is a mishmash of design ideas that never gel into a fun game. There are a few solid elements of gameplay in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , but in the end it's an incredibly repetitive design that's very unrewarding in its short time through the adventure. The game's plot is based around the arrival of an evil beast known as the Darkhul King. Hundreds of years ago he was banished as a prisoner of a hidden dimension, but he's escaped; and he's putting his dead-raising powers to use all over Sunnydale. While the rest of her friends hide back in the coziness of their homes trying to figure out who this Darkhul King is and how to rid Sunnydale of him, Buffy has to head out into the streets and other locations to kick some undead booty in a side-scrolling action design. Buffy's the only playable character in this adventure; the other television players are represented through still screens digitized from the series...which admittedly are the only graphics that look good in this lacking action title. While the developers try to make it look like Buffy has a whole lot of ass-kicking skills and technique, all that's really required is a rapid thumb on the A and B buttons to knock out the enemies, followed by a stab in the chest with a wooden stake that's collected all over the environments. Sure, players can collect weapons and combine them to create even more powerful weapons, but the action is bland since the designers never implemented any encouragement to use anything beyond the fist-foot-stake combination. Sure, you'll find places to use the crossbow or axe, but it's actually a chore to bring them out of your inventory and into combat that it's almost not worth the effort. Occasionally players will be able to do more than just kick and punch; locate door switches, for example, or shove crates to access higher levels. But these are extremely rudimentary gameplay elements that have been done better a zillion times before in other games. The game just doesn't feel like it was handled by a competent Game Boy Advance design team; the collision detection in the combat engine is a bit wonky since some punches connect but others don't...and it's not exactly fun to miss stabbing someone in the chest by only a pixel or two when they're down on the ground. The in-game graphic style, full of awkward angles and poorly-drawn sprites, does nothing to \"wow\" gamers with special effects, and the scrolling perspective is actually hard to follow since due to the designers creating platforms that move deeper into the background for no real reason.",

        "Subtitle": "Ground-up for Wii isn't always a good thing.",

        "Content": "As far as this reviewer is concerned, Final Fantasy: Crystal Defenders is the bester tower defense series out there.  Sure, the game is going to get mixed reviews from various editors across different platforms, but as a huge fan of the tower defense genre I end up picking up nearly every available option as far as strategy game mods go, iPhone downloads, community XBLA games, or anywhere else I can get my strategy fix.  In the end though, I always go back to the Crystal Defenders series, as it has the classic sprite design, music, and classes I enjoy.   Each version seems to be a bit different though, as Square Enix is still either feeling out or cashing in on a game that began as a Japanese cell phone endeavor.  Whether or not this game is for you may be based on a few different factors.  Do you have cash to spare?  Is this your first Crystal Defenders?  Do you own an iPhone or other consoles?  Crystal Defenders is a fun game, but it's also not the best version out there either.  The official name for the Wii release is actually Crystal Defenders R1 , or \"Round 1.\"  This insinuates a round two and so-forth, which is where some of the worry comes into play.  I've spent about two hours with R1, beat its 13 levels – most of them on the first or second try – and want more from the game. R2 may be on the way, but if it's another 800 points as it looks to be, Square is seriously gouging players, as the game is fun on Wii, but doesn't have nearly the amount of depth found on the iPhone – or by extension, 360 – release.  It's a more introductory experience, and there's still some fun to be had, but the bar has been set higher by portables, and as a new take on the series the Wii version is fun but limited.  This series rocks, but wait... Where's the other 2/3 of the game?  Did Square forget it released three full worlds, twice as many units, and a massively superior version of this game on iPhone at the same price?  360 even got the full port just a few weeks ago...  While the Wii version of Crystal Defenders is inspired by its source material, it's also a new game, and different from any previous offering.  The concept of killing enemies before they exit a level, spawning heroes and leveling them up with cash is all still there, but you're getting 13 \"new\" stages to do it in.  With that being said, the first 10 of those are used to introduce the game's units, and none of the main stages have branching paths, so for Crystal Defenders veterans this one is a piece of cake.  Available in R1 are seven character classes and – unless there's an unlockable one I've yet to come upon – three summons.  Heroes include the ground-based Soldier, distance magic casting Black Mage, multi-hit Monk, powerhouse distance Archer, pick pocketing Thief, slowdown-using Time Mage, and ground/air hybrid Dragoon.  Each unit attacks for different amounts, has a certain starting fee, and can be upgraded to a \"MAX\" level that depends on each unit's potential.  As you battle through wave after wave, each kill grants you gold which can be used to upgrade, with new waves bringing tougher enemies with high HP and certain special traits.  Some will resist or be totally immune to magic or physical attacks, you've got air-only units, gigantic bosses, speed units, or even a few that steal multiple crystals if they exit the stage.  Lose all your crystals, and the game is over.  The overall experience feels very similar to other Crystal Defenders games, though as I mentioned it's a bit on the easier side (of course the other Crystal Defenders games are downright relentless, so this can still be challenging for newcomers).  Unfortunately the Wii version doesn't make use of what could have been a very handy IR pointer, with the entire game controlled via the Wii-mote on its side like an NES controller.  You've still got all the expected options during play, such as the ability to pause mid-wave and upgrade or create new heroes, the ability to speed up to 4X if you know you've got a wave dominated and want to skip through the battles faster, and the displays for attack power, range, status effects, and overall power of each unit is easy to see when you hover over them and hit the 2 button.  For those wondering, the cash, attack powers, and upgrade tiers are actually slightly different from previous Crystal Defenders games, this time giving archers a bit more hurting power in relation to other units, and making thieves and time mages cheaper, but also (at least in the case of thieves) way more important for success.  Your Esper summons, only unlocked after beating the final regular stage, take away from your crystal bank, and should only be used in do-or-die situations.  The Wii version of Crystal Defenders also has online rankings for levels, but it's limited to just a few instances at the end of the game, and not every stage.  Since the game is largely based on overall score – depending on the amount of cash and crystals you have left at the end, among other things – online leaderboards are a must. Unfortunately only two of the main 12 levels include it, with the 13th being a bonus addition to the main experience.  Updages are simple to get though, so while it's limited in execution, the design is set up for Round 2 whenever that hits.  Unfortunately, all indications so far from Square lean on that being another standalone, 800 point effort.  $7.99 is the price of the full version on iPhone (with the ports to other consoles a tad more), but to get that much content on WiiWare it could take up to R3, which now brings the price up to $24;  that's way too much for what is basically a ported design thus far.

        "Title": "PES 2019 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Players come alive in the most authentic entry yet.",
        "Subheader": "By Benjamin Griffin Updated: Sep 18, 2020 3:28 pm Posted: Aug 28, 2018 12:00 am",
        "Content": "PES 2019 makes an interesting distinction. It’s not a game about football so much as it is a game about the guys playing football. And exactly how they play it - their behaviours, tendencies, and individual techniques - makes for a livelier game. No longer are you a massive deity in the sky moving generic pieces around a pitch, nor should you think of your team as a collection of stats. Here, players take on a life of their own.  The biggest development is a feature called Magic Moments. This refers to a set of 39 RPG-like traits that are distributed across the roster of players in combinations that give each of them their own personality. So, for instance, only gifted shooters like Kevin De Bruyne can hit ferocious rising thunder-bastards that rifle into the net, while Ronaldo’s headers are practically laser-guided. Magic Moments go further than merely adding new moves, though. They also offer effects such as fighting spirit (which gives players better performance when fatigued), super sub (where players improve if brought on in the second half), and man marking (which enables a player to more doggedly stick to opponents). What’s good is these animations happen automatically, whether a pinpoint cross or an acrobatic clearance off the goal line, triggering by themselves if you’re in the right time and place. This makes players feel as distinct to control as they are to watch.   This stuff contributes more than any novelty new trick because it emulates football’s intangibles. Get Liverpool’s Henderson on the pitch and his captaincy attribute reduces team fatigue. Similarly, with Neymar’s notorious penchant for going down a little too easily in real life, here he comes loaded with an effect called malicia, which roughly translates from Spanish as ‘craftiness’, due to his success at winning free kicks. These hallmarks bring an extra element of authenticity without seeming like unfair advantages - after all, watch Henderson in real life and you’ll see how motivational (and shouty) he can be. As a result, PES 2019’s players transcend their stats. It’s not just about how they’re rated out of 100, but what unique quality they can bring to the team.  Keep in mind, however, that you do need at least a base level knowledge of football to appreciate this, otherwise it can all feel a bit random. How is the casual fan to know their team’s stamina would endure if only they brought on a certain player? Some kind of icon on the HUD wouldn’t have gone amiss. Magic Moments noticeably impact games and therefore need highlighting.  Players feel as distinct to control as they are to watch. “  There are more distinct player behaviours too, here called ‘playing styles’. Ever the poacher, Harry Kane will tend to linger in the box, while Bayern’s sweeper keeper Manuel Neuer frequently races off his line to intercept wayward balls. Obviously, such behaviours are lessened when you’re in control, so they come into play more against the computer. Shutting down an AI Kieran Trippier who loves hugging the touchline and delivering crosses, or identifying and then isolating a target man like Karim Benzema, adds more ways of strategizing. Teams truly feel like they’re composed of individuals, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.  All this, of course, leads you to the opposition’s goal, and every effort on target here looks utterly unique, as if the animation was crafted for that exact moment. At one point in a match I played, Gareth Bale sprinted to meet a 50/50 ball before the onrushing keeper and just managed to poke the ball under him as momentum took the Welshman sailing over the top. In what seemed to be the same continuous animation, he picked himself off the floor, raised his arms, and roared towards his adoring fans. The blending of these separate motions is virtually flawless. That said, in replays I have seen more clipping issues than I recall last year, such as a foot passing through a rival leg, but they’re easy enough to miss on the default camera view.   Shots look good, then, but they don’t always feel good. The moment balls hit the net is still strangely anticlimactic, as if PES 2019 is waiting to catch up, and what should have been screamers seem more like ghost goals. It’s been an ingrained PES problem for a while now, and Konami has yet to find a solution. In FIFA, if a shot is good enough to beat the keeper you know about it the moment it leaves your player’s foot, and consequently that shot has a build up. In comparison, PES feels a little loose and lawless. A lazy header that has no right troubling the keeper will worm its way under their flapping gloves, while what looks like a surefire blast from five yards out will go embarrassingly wide. PES shots look glorious in replays after the fact, yet strangely empty in the moment.  PES shots look glorious in replays after the fact, yet strangely empty in the moment. “  On the offensive PES 2019 is slick, but defensively it’s lacking. Jostling often results in a foul, and sliding seemingly inevitably leads to card. Football is a contact sport, yet referees here actively penalise the slightest collisions and rarely play the advantage. You end up relying on the command that brings a teammate over to pressure the ball carrier while you block off passing options. Sure, this is a widely used tactic in the modern game, but that it’s the only viable one here greatly restricts your defensive options.  In terms of improvements to modes, we’ll start with Master League, and one feature impacts it above all others: team roles. There are 22 different team roles ranging from Creator, who boosts team growth, to Workhouse, who improves team stamina. Those who fit the role of Hero, Superstar, and Legend attract income through sponsorship, merchandise, and fan clubs, so lose an icon like Messi and you’ll take a financial hit. For those not enamoured by tinkering with formations in the team management screen, team roles bring an exciting extra dimension to Master League’s coaching by turning players into utilities.  Richer player individuality also feeds into more detailed transfers. You can search for players who fit a specific niche, like a Rising Star or Bad Boy, filter by abilities such as Explosive Power, and choose based on playing styles like Trickster or Long Ball Expert. Contract talks themselves are slightly more refined too, letting you set performance bonuses and sell-on fees, and more importantly, showing you how likely the club is to accept the offer. Propose to trade your Ryan Shawcross for Ronaldo and watch the probability of a deal plummet to 0%. While it does make for more involved negotiations, it’s far from the headline act Master League needed to rope in new fans.  Every IGN Pro Evolution Soccer Review Ever 28 Images  Other than those two additions, Master League plays it disappointingly safe yet again, unless you’re particularly into the menu’s newly embedded video clips showing, say, your custom manager silently giving an interview. There’s also the official pre-season International Champions Cup, which would be a real plus if anyone cared about it. And finally, there are nine new leagues, but the likes of the Scottish, Russian, and Argentinian divisions don’t make up for omission of the traditional Spanish, Italian, and English leagues, nor the galling loss of the UEFA Champions League. That Chelsea still play under the name ‘London FC’ coats PES 2019 in that familiar layer of inescapable inauthenticity, as though you’re on the outside looking in, and Master League simply can’t escape that shadow. But for the minority so inclined, you can take the extra steps to download community data files and import correct team names, kits, and logos.  NOTE: Unfortunately, the servers weren’t up for MyClub mode at the time of review, so I’m not able to give a verdict on that specific feature.",

        "Subheader": "By Erik Brudvig Updated: May 9, 2012 5:19 am Posted: Dec 1, 2009 11:54 pm",
        "Content": "James Cameron has delivered some movies of monstrous proportions. Titanic, Aliens and The Terminator have all come to us courtesy of the Canadian filmmaker. This December sees the release of the long-awaited Avatar , a movie about an alien moon called Pandora and the battle over its riches. Cameron's last movie, Titanic, set all sorts of box office records. That puts the expectations for Avatar at near impossible levels and naturally paves the way for a videogame adaptation. It's a game that I had high hopes for and though it does its best to play to the movie's strengths -- featuring a lush jungle world and 3D visuals – Avatar: The Game ultimately suffers from unpolished and thin gameplay elements.  Avatar: The Game takes place on the same moon as its movie counterpart but rather than retelling Cameron's tale, it offers a prequel story and an introduction to Pandora's past. The reason for all of the commotion? Pandora is the only known place to harvest unobtanium, a mineral worth whatever it takes to get it. Unfortunately, Pandora has a toxic atmosphere and is the home to some hostile locals, including giant carnivorous plants and the Na'vi, an alien race that stands roughly 10 feet tall. The RDA, a military for hire, has countered with Avatars, a genetic hybrid between humans and Na'vi. And so the war begins in earnest.   Watch the video review. Very little of this is actually explained directly to the player. Instead, you're thrust into the role of Abel Ryder, a new RDA recruit with an Avatar to control – never you mind what an Avatar is or why they exist. Soon after, you're forced to choose to fight either for the Na'vi as a full-time Avatar or for the RDA. The game wastes no time getting right down to brass tacks, but in doing so glosses over what should have been its chance to lay down the groundwork for any motivation it might have offered the player. Instead, it sets up a series of generic quests and little bits of story about the search for some special rocks that you'll have just about no investment in.  If you decide to fight for the RDA, Avatar: The Game plays as a third-person shooter, offering plenty of guns and war machines to take down the flora and fauna. Fight for the Na'vi and you'll instead wield primitive though effective clubs, staffs and knives. Limited ranged combat is in store for the Na'vi fighter as well through a machine gun and a bow and arrows, but the majority of the action is up close and personal. Though both sides have similar special powers to call upon, this setup makes for two drastically different experiences.   You can choose to fight for the Na'vi, or for the RDA as pictured here. Both branches of the game last between four and six hours – more if you take on all of the side tasks – but each tell their own story and deliver their own style of gaming. Will you play a straight action game with limited platforming as you fight for the natives? Or will you tackle a third-person shooter and lay waste to everything in sight using guns and flamethrowers? Or will you wind up playing both sides to double your game time? It's a nice concept and the two sides of the Avatar: The Game coin are different enough to make each feel distinct. Neither, however, plays well enough to make it a standout.  There's nothing disastrous here, and the RDA shooter side of things performs well enough to be occasionally enjoyable. The quest design, including both the main and side tasks, is about as generic as they come. Go here, collect this, plant these bombs, or kill this and then return to me. It's mindless, you shoot stuff and it explodes. It works, though it could handle a lot better and the enemy AI isn't up to snuff. During one big boss battle at the end, my foe jumped off of a cliff and then ran across a field and hid in a corner. Searching for him wasn't very fun.   Fighting for the Na'vi is a bit worse. The animations are stiff and awkward. The camera, particularly in the melee combat, is unsteady enough to be disorienting and perhaps even nauseating. The controls feel far too loose, a problem that also exists any time you get in a vehicle. The whole ordeal just isn't anything you'd really want to play for that long. The quests are about the same as the RDA, as is the story though told from a different perspective, which doesn't leave a whole lot of room for fun.  Avatar: The Game offers distractions that try their best to cover up these shortcomings, but they too aren't as fully fleshed out as one would hope. There's lots of wrapping paper here, but unfortunately the box is empty. A perfect example is the leveling system. Gain enough XP and you'll move up a level, but the XP doled out is trivial for everything but main quest completion. New levels offer upgraded skills, weapon and armor, but these upgrades are auto-equipped and hardly noticeable. Pick your favorite skills and weapons at the beginning of the game and that's all the management you'll do. It's a leveling and unlocking system that isn't much more than window dressing.   Fighting for the Na'vi isn't as fun as one would hope. There's also a mini-game inspired by Risk in which experience gained in the main game converts into a currency for buying new units and upgrades in a game for global domination. Controlling areas in that game, in turn, offers experience points and upgrades in the main game. It's a genuinely cool idea and it's one I wish offered more actual reward for tackling.  There's a whole suite of multiplayer modes to tackle once you've finished the main game twice. This game puts players on either the Na'vi or RDA teams in a head-to-head team match. There are your standard capture the flag and deathmatch modes, as well as games of attack and defend and capture and hold. The same gameplay shortcomings that hamper the single player game make this one you probably won't keep playing for long.   There's also a multiplayer game. It's not great. The shining star of Avatar: The Game, unsurprisingly, is the world of Pandora. You can learn a bit more about it through the Pandorapedia unlocked by exploring the world. Most of us, though, will simply run through the lush jungle and marvel at the alien world. Floating mountains, carnivorous plants, massive creatures and more pack the screen at all times. It's enough to occasionally cause the visuals to stutter as the game can't keep up with both the action and the packed backdrop. It looks even better in 3D, if you have a screen capable of displaying it. This literally makes the world jump out at you. Bullets will whip by your head. Bits of plants will creep out around you. It's a cool effect and one that fits in perfectly with the movie it is based on. Cameron's world and all of its alien life forms were captured quite well visually.",

        "Content": "Battle Princess of Arcadias wasn’t announced with much fanfare, but I sat up and took notice anyway. It immediately reminded me of games like Odin Sphere and Grim Grimoire, and since I’m a huge Vanillaware fan, I knew I had to play it. I can’t say that Battle Princess can go toe to toe with Odin Sphere, but it is bubbly mix of beat ‘em up, role-playing, and strategy kept me smiling the whole time I played it.  The first thing I noticed about Battle Princess is its bright and beautiful world, which sets it apart from the more common drab, post-apocalyptic look of so many other games about a world in need of a savior. It’s clear that developer Apollosoft took its art direction cues from Vanillaware (forests and mountains look like they’re copied directly from Odin Sphere), and Battle Princess does a good job capturing the vibrant color palette. Unfortunately, it also looks like an old Flash game, based on the at times flat and choppy quality of the animation. I was relieved to find that choppiness doesn’t affect the gameplay in any way, since much of Battle Princess’ fun lies in the fast-paced combat.  Three different combat modes are available: regular combat, skirmishes and sieges. Combat is by far the easiest and most enjoyable mode for me – I loved cutting down enemies using the red-haired protagonist Plume and her Princess Corp. (a group of nine playable companions that accompany the battle princess wherever she goes). Well mapped-out and responsive controls make it smooth and easy to set up 100-hit combos of light, strong, and special attacks, which kept the action zipping along. I also like being able to quickly swap out characters in combat by tapping the R1 button, letting me take advantage of each character’s special weapon type (sword, spear, gun, etc.) and skill set, which proved to be useful against the myriad different enemies that appeared on the battlefield. Best of all, when things got hairy I could use built-up skill points to unleash a massive group attack that instantly destroyed everything in its path.  If Combat was the easiest mode for me to learn, then Skirmish was by far the most challenging. In these brigade vs. brigade melees, Plume and Co. are joined by a separate band of fighters who take on enemy forces in the background. Like the Princess Corp., the brigade is made up of units that specialize in one weapon type, and successfully fighting enemy forces meant ensuring these units always went up against opponents with weaker weapon types. Otherwise the entire brigade would be wiped out in a hurry. I had to constantly switch tactics and swap out fighting units in the background, while simultaneously attacking enemies with Princess Corp. members in the foreground. It’s a tough juggling act, but when I finally got the swing of things I began to welcome the challenge of trying to attack enemies on two different fronts at the same time.  The third branch of combat is Siege mode, which involves the Princess Corp. leading the brigade directly into battle against huge bosses. It wasn’t as difficult as Skirmish mode, since all brigade units are on the field at once, but it wasn’t as exciting either. Since the entire brigade was involved, I had to make sure each unit was properly leveled up or these mega bosses would destroy them, which was the most tedious part of Battle Princess’ combat.  That’s because Brigade units can only be as strong as their corresponding Princess Corp member. (For example, if sword-wielding Plume is level 8, the brigade’s fencers can only be level 8. If her right-hand man Raltz is level 7, archers can only be level 7). Unfortunately, since you can only choose three Princess Corp. members to take with you on a mission, I had to do a lot of level grinding in order to ensure all 10 playable characters and their corresponding brigades were strong enough to take on the tough enemies found in Siege mode. This slowed down the pace of things considerably, which naturally I wasn’t too keen on. Care Bear...STARE!  At the end of the day the level-grinding was worth it though, because it allowed me to take pride whenever my brigade overcame tough odds. Better yet, level grinding allowed me to listen to my favorite Battle Princess tunes over and over again. I’m absolutely wild about soundtrack, which is a mix of light, ethereal pieces and fast tempoed J-pop (think Japanese composer Hitoshi Sakimoto meets Perfume).  I wish I could tell you the story and characters are as amazing as the soundtrack and combat, but I can’t. The story is boring. Basically it’s just Princess Plume and her friends fighting a group of mysterious beings that want to take over the world. With the exception of a few small twists and turns, that’s it. Never once in the nearly 30 hours I spent playing Battle Princess did I ever find myself on the edge of my seat.  As for the characters, Princess Plume and her friends are nothing more than the typical anime/JRPG tropes I’ve seen before: Plume is the cheerful, brainless leader, Raltz her sweet but naive right-hand man, Deishe is the weird, skeevy perve, Marianne is the other weird, skeevy perve, Rudolph the brutish loudmouth, and so on. I admit there were a couple of genuinely funny character interactions (the constant fighting for Raltz’s attention amongst Princess Corp. members is an example), but for the most part I found talking to people to be grating or downright creepy, as many scenarios involved adults trying to hit on minors. I smite you with color!  Luckily, you can actually skip conversations all together if you want, so most of my time between battles was spent on the much more fun task of upgrading weapons and accessories. If I knew the next mission involved going to an icy mountain full of physically tough monsters, I could equip characters with fire-based weapons and higher attack levels. Plume can also level up individual units of her brigade while off the battlefield, though doing so got to be quite costly as my brigade’s levels got higher. Then again, I had so much money by the end of Plume’s adventures that it wasn’t too much of a problem.",

        "Content": "It took me a few minutes to get that KrissX is supposed to be pronounced \"criss-cross\" and not \"Chris Ex\". But stupid name aside, Konami's new Xbox Live Arcade puzzle game is an original, but not very exciting little download.  KrissX is essentially the lovechild of the crossword puzzle and the jumble. Scrambled, intersecting words are displayed and players have to unscramble them by swapping letters around. Usually one swap is all it takes. It's a simple concept that is easy to get into. The letters that intersect each other are anchored in, so players can use them as context clues for the bigger words. There are multiple modes, including a Time Attack mode that has players go one word at a time with only a few seconds to solve each one.  Unfortunately the game is overly simple in the beginning. It's full of five letter words that only have one letter off. When you select the word the game gives you a definition hint, which further takes away any challenge. The later levels start to get challenging and bigger, but I was nearly a third of the way through before it ever felt like a real puzzle. There are 150 levels, which sounds like a lot, but it took me about five minutes to get through 30 of them. And even by level 30 I was seeing repeat words.  The backdrop for the game is a bright and colorful meadow, to accompany the owl character that acts as your guide. There are extra little score bonuses that pop up throughout and the game cheers you on the whole way. It gives the game a very PopCap feel, which is likely the intent. It's cute and charming, more so than most puzzle games in the Arcade.  KrissX is sorely lacking mutliplayer. Even with the additional modes and special puzzles, the game still feels bare bones. Some sort of online component, or even local multiplayer would have worked wonders for the game, especially since there's a focus on completing puzzles quickly.",

        "Content": "After over three years' worth of weekly additions to the Virtual Console lineup, you'd think that the Big N's back catalog would be all dried up -- not so. Today, kicking off Year 4 of the existence of the VC retro gaming download service, is yet another undeniable classic from Nintendo's past. It's Super Mario Kart .  Super Mario Kart is all about racing for the checkered flag through a variety of cartoonish landscapes inspired by the Mario universe. You pick your character from a selection of eight Mario mascots, including the man himself, his brother Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, the grand and villainous King Bowser Koopa, Donkey Kong Jr. and a common Koopa Troopa. You then choose your engine speed from 50, 100 or 150cc (roughly equivalent to an Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty setting) and try to take home the gold after completing a circuit of several  sequential races against all the others, who are trying to knock you out of the running with off-the-wall weapons like Koopa shells and banana peels. First place finishes are worth the most points, second place a little less, and so on -- so you'll want to try your best to be the first to cross the finish line every time, to ensure your place at the top of the winner's podium.  But then, you knew all that already. Because you've very likely already played this game before -- you may even be one of the over eight million individuals who bought a copy of the SNES cartridge in the '90s, a sales total that made it the third-best selling game of all time for Nintendo's 16-bit machine. That sales total, though, isn't the only important thing about this classic -- Super Mario Kart is important in nearly every way a video game can be.   The constant split-screen view was a novelty in '92. Perhaps an early inspiration for the Nintendo DS?  It's important historically for the industry, for establishing the \"kart\" sub-category of the racing genre. It's important as the start of Mario's most popular spin-off series. It's important as the start of the very idea of Mario-based spin-off series, even (since it was the first one). And more than all those, too -- the list of its accolades is immense. There's a reason why it's still fondly remembered to this day, and why it's been consistently honored with high-ranking spots in several publications' lists of the top video games of all time. (It took #23 in our own countdown , two years ago.)  Most important of all, though, is that the game is still just plain fun to play. Picking up a Classic Controller or GameCube Pad and re-experiencing this design, in emulated form through the Virtual Console, is just as compelling as when it was first powered on through a Super NES back in 1992. It's probably not that surprising that a Mario Kart game is fun to play, as it's become a flagship series for Nintendo in the 17 years since this first release -- but what's most interesting about this first Super Mario Kart is the particular appeal it had. The little details of design that stayed unique to it, as the sequels evolved in their own direction.  The racing, for instance, is much more core to the experience here in the first Super Mario Kart. Tracks are designed with skill in mind -- laid out in such a way that there are clear best lines to take in twisting around each turn, angles of approach that can shave precious seconds off your laps if you take the time to learn them. It's almost as if these tracks were designed specifically for the single player attempting to put up the fastest possible totals in time trials -- it's no wonder, then, that the time trial mode is still competed on by original Kart fans to this day.  The trademarks of the Mario Kart series, of course, have little to do with one player attacking courses on his own -- it's all about the mayhem that happens when several different racers are all trying to rule the road at the same time, and jockeying for position with the help of tons of different weapons and power-ups. Those elements got their start here in the first Super Mario Kart, too, but you can tell that the focus is more subdued -- more modern sequels in the series seem to put all of the emphasis on the items, as they're constantly adding more and more off-the-wall weaponry. More racers are pushed into play at the same time, too, so much so that they ended up cramming two characters onto each vehicle in the GameCube's Double Dash!! .   Here, though, the items and characters are all elements that completely support the core focus -- the racing. That's why this game has items like the Feather, which serves little purpose other than allowing you to exploit shortcuts in certain tracks -- shaving off those precious seconds. Later games in the series cut out the Feather, because that functionality didn't fit any more. The games were, are, no longer as focused on the actual racing.  I don't mean to elevate the incredible magical awesomeness of this first Super Mario Kart game by belittling its sequels -- that's not my point. All of the Mario Kart games to come after this one have been great, too. I'm just making the case that this original design has a different aim that most of its follow-ups -- and to finish the point, I'll just observe that the original Super Mario Kart has no Blue Shell. That sums things up pretty well.  A few other facts that you might not immediately recall about Super Mario Kart, and might affect your decision to re-buy it in VC form (or buy it for the first time) -- the visuals are in a constant split-screen. Whether you play alone or with a second player, you'll always only get half a screen to look at. Not sure why that is, except that there might have been a lot of empty space taken up by only background images if the whole screen was used for one display. So, when you play single player mode, you'll get a convenient map view on the lower half of your TV -- complete with position data letting you know just how far ahead (or behind) you are compared to every one else.   Koopa Troopa -- the serious choice for the serious racer.  This first Super Mario Kart maxes out at two-player support, too -- the four-player simultaneous action that has become another of the series' trademarks didn't come along until Mario Kart 64 , almost half a decade after this game's debut. Battle Mode is here, so you can still go head-to-head against a buddy popping balloons with shells and peels -- you just can't get any more people involved than that, at the same time.  Finally, the first Super Mario Kart is the one game in the series to feature truly unique victory celebrations for each different character. That may seem like less of an important observation than the others, but it's not. Seeing Toad pop a giant floating Cheep Cheep like a balloon with the cork shooting out of a bottle of champagne, and then watching a giant vine nonsensically grow out of the end of the bottle is the greatest visual image the series has ever had -- you know it's true.",

        "Content": "I like to fantasize as much as the next poor loser whose life is too mundane to deal with constantly. I jump between the usual topics: winning the lottery, a deserted island inhabited only by Swedish bikini models, and what I'd do with Mr. Fantastic's super power. However, my fantasies generally don't include aquariums, or really, any glass tanks or aquatic organisms. So it was with a mild curiosity that I investigated Fantasy Aquarium . What did Ertain develop that could fulfill my hidden aquarium-based desires? The back of the box seemed promising enough. \"Fantasy Aquarium allows you to keep marine creatures that could never be kept as pets, such as Blue Whales, Dolphins, Seals and Sharks! But if the wrong combination of creatures are added, the consequences can be lethal!\" I dove into the game thinking I could create some sort of Free Willy vs Jaws scenario, only to find out that the only thing lethal about the game is the alarming speed in which it made me want to drown myself.  The main goal of Fantasy Aquarium is to, I don't know, make the fish happy? The developers never seemed to bother to create objectives. I examined the instruction booklet (not part of my fantasy) and still couldn't figure out why I was charged with taking care of sperm whales.  Saying Fantasy Aquarium is casual implies that it holds some appeal towards the casual gamer market. I'd say the game is more catatonic than casual. The entire appeal of getting to take care of dolphins instead of goldfish is that dolphins actually do interesting things. All the animals in Fantasy Aquarium behave like any other boring Wal-Mart fish. They swim back in forth in a looped animation and don't react to anything. Of course they don't have much to react to. Really the only thing I was able to do to my fishes and whales was drop food in their tank. Then I got to watch in rapt fascination as my pets did nothing at all and the food just magically disappeared.  There are no points in Fantasy Aquarium. No money to buy stuff with. You can buy as many dolphins as you want, then let them all die and just buy some more. The big pay off is just watching the couple seconds of looping swimming animation while you listen to tedious, ocean inspired music that you might find on a bargain CD in a real aquarium's gift shop.   It's like it's the real ocean! But wait, there was a promise of lethal consequences! I quickly scrolled through the list of available animals and filled a tank with Emperor Penguins and Killer Whales. I've seen Happy Feet, I know that's trouble. I waited with sadistic anticipation for the tank to become stained red with the blood of penguins.  Only it never happened. Everyone swam around like nothing was wrong, and instead the penguins just started to disappear. Occasionally the message \"A penguin has been eaten\" would be displayed on the top screen. I didn't even get to flush them down the toilet, which makes the experience far less satisfying than my last aquarium tragedy.  To make this painfully dull experience more fun I utilized the tank customization tool. From there players are able to decorate their tanks to make them more pleasant. The problem is that everything in the game is so hideous that the tank always looks tacky. The Greek temple and Leaning Tower of Pisa decoration might be kind of cool if they were just flat, pixilated clip art. Worse yet, the fish pass right through the objects. The tank's wall and background can be tiled with neon colors or weird, clashing wallpaper. It just ends up making the whale and dolphin tanks look like they're located on the Vegas strip. And not the nice section of the strip either. More like down by Circus Circus.  There are numerous aquatic creatures to unlock, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. Somehow I did stuff that made new fish appear in the selection screen. Of course the big leaguers like Dolphins, Killer Whales, Penguins, Seals and Manta Rays are already unlocked from the start, and there isn't room to have a lot of animals anyway.",

        "Content": "Not as much has changed in the world of Mount & Blade since 2010’s Warband as I might have expected. But when I get into one of Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlords’ pitched battles and charge through an enemy infantry formation while gleefully swinging my sword like a champion, it honestly feels like maybe what wasn’t broken didn’t need fixing. Sure, it’s not the most polished of experiences, hence the early access launch. But its exciting, tactical combat and gorgeous sandbox campaign map full of new lands to win and new characters to meet feed my deep, burning need for a nitty-gritty, intimate take on medieval-ish warfare. Bannerlord’s graphics are the most immediately impactful improvement from its decade-old predecessor. The stunning map allows you to scroll completely seamlessly from practically right over your character’s shoulder all the way up to a high-level strategic view, where you can decide whether to raid caravans, fight as a mercenary for a powerful lord, or even found your own kingdom. The lighting, textures, and terrain are all impressive, and the level of detail really makes me feel like I’m in a living world. The character models and armor textures are pretty slick as well, even if they do still seem a few steps behind the current generation of blockbusters. Bannerlord has also been drastically improved over Warband’s notoriously janky interface. It’s visually pleasing, well-organized, and easy to work with when you’re organizing your troops or unraveling the intriguing political web that binds each of the eight major factions. However, there are certain things that don’t have tooltips which I wish were better explained, such as what Morale actually does – there’s not even an encyclopedia entry for it. And there’s a significant amount of lag when switching between menus that kind of gets on my nerves. But it’s still a huge step up from what Warband players had to deal with that it feels like a big breath of fresh air. The interface is a huge step up from what Warband players had to deal with.Not everything else about Bannerlord does, though. For something that’s been in development for about eight years, there’s still a surprising amount of jank on display. Especially early on, before you get to the really good stuff, it’s easy to get the feeling that you’re just playing Warband with better graphics. Targeting and interacting with items and characters in towns and on battle maps is still imprecise and sometimes unresponsive. And there are some weird design decisions, like the fact that you have to wait through three loading screens to do something really simple like initiate a battle: one to speak to the enemy commander, one to load back into the world map, and one to actually start the fight. Even on an SSD with relatively short load times, that can get irritating. There are a lot of little things that really don’t feel modern, which are especially noticeable next to all of the ones that do. IGN's Top 25 Modern PC Games 32 Images So naturally, the early gameplay will be pretty familiar to Mount & Blade veterans: You ride around the countryside doing missions and fighting bandits to gain gold, equipment, and reputation. These missions have a good deal of variety, which is nice since Warband could often feel like an endless loop of the same small list of tasks. Aside from old mainstays like escorting a caravan or hunting down poachers, you might be called on to resolve a blood feud or help merchants secure permits to sell their wares in a major town. These also inject a bit of worldbuilding and moral ambiguity in some interesting ways. That band of poachers might implore you not to side with the fat-cat nobles who are denying them the right to a livelihood, opening up an alternate path for resolving the situation. Each of the six playable factions has its own rich personality, backstory, and style of fighting.The worldbuilding in general is pretty great. Set about 200 years before Warband, we see the ancestors of some of the factions we know locked in a tense struggle centered on a collapsing, Roman-inspired empire that has broken into three parts. Each of the six playable factions has its own rich personality, backstory, and style of fighting. I wish your choice of national origin had a little bit more of an impact, though. As it stands, it’s mostly flavor that doesn’t impose restrictions that might make you significantly alter your playstyle. Anyone can recruit any kind of troops and join any faction they wish. You only get one small campaign bonus based on where you were born, like being able to build structures faster or reduced movement penalty in forest terrain. What's Your Mount & Blade Playstyle? Mercenary Merchant Noble Raider Answer See Results Once I got out and about and started meeting the various princes, lords, and knights, my interest in the world really picked up. There is an intricate political web to unravel between the leaders of the various factions, with each having a different story about what happened at a pivotal battle right before the start of the campaign that set the present events in motion. Piecing together the details will eventually lead you to two significant choices: joining an existing faction or starting your own, and trying to restore the old Calradian Empire or wiping its remnants from the map. While the story is presented pretty simplistically and without much dramatic flair, I could see these options providing a lot of replayability just due to the different flavor your campaign can take on based on which route you choose. Do you want to be the barbarian at the gates, or the successor to ancient glories? It’s on the battlefield where Bannerlord really delivers.But it’s on the battlefield where Bannerlord really delivers. The hitboxes on weapons and soldiers are impressively realistic, creating a high skill ceiling and a welcome sense of authenticity. You can have a spear thrust miss between someone’s shoulder and their helmet, and it’s always clear why the blow didn’t connect. This forced me to develop a good sense of timing and muscle memory to consistently get clean kills, which is a way more satisfying sense of progression than just putting points into a skill tree. I still don’t love the four-directional parry system, since we’ve seen that same thing done better in other games recently, and the lack of a stamina system can make one-on-one duels spammy and annoying, but at least I could strap on a shield and never have to worry about it. Battles also feature smoother animations and much better unit AI than Warband, which was prone to somehow find the worst possible way to interpret any orders it was given. The new command interface is clean, readable, and makes it very easy to form control groups and give specific, detailed orders like forming a shield wall or keeping their distance and skirmishing with ranged weapons. The tactical options available are broad and executing them is relatively painless, which is much more than I could say for Warband. I did run into some significant performance issues and stuttering on larger battles, and especially sieges, but it’s been getting better with the almost daily patches TaleWorlds has been releasing. The tactical options available are broad and executing them is relatively painless.Bannerlord’s biggest new systems are the Clan and Kingdom screens. Your clan includes your family and retainers, which can include a spouse and eventually children who can grow up and fight. If you join or end up ruling a kingdom, you can make changes like setting new tax laws – as long as your vassals approve, of course. The vassal management system is a bit clunky and unwieldy and mostly involves getting other lords on your side by tracking them down and earning their favor by picking correct dialogue options… but there’s a chance you’ll fail based on your Charm stat even if you say all the right things, and that’s just annoying. This is one area that could definitely use some more love before Bannerlord is ready to cast off its early access label. What Qualities Will You Look For in a Bannerlord Spouse? Personality Looks Deadliness Administrative Ability Political Benefits Answer See Results As is typical of an early access game, I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about weird and even game-breaking bugs out in the community, but mercifully I haven’t been the victim of any serious ones so far. I’ve hit a few irritating video and audio glitches here and there, of course. Reloading a save once caused some troops I recruited to mysteriously disappear. I also ran into a consistent crash bug when I tried to launch a siege after taking over as its leader from another character. Thankfully, the patches have been coming quickly and relentlessly and there seem to be fewer technical issues every time I boot Bannerlord up.",

        "Content": "Miniature golf has yet to be done well on Wii. There have been a few attempts so far, but all have fallen flat -- 2K's Carnival Games take on the sport didn't pan out, Shin'en's WiiWare rendition didn't fly, and you're not going to trick very many people into going crazy with the Kidz Sports version. You'd think that it'd be easy to translate the putting mechanics presented first in Nintendo's own Wii Sports into a fully-featured putt-putt product, but it just hasn't happened. And King of Clubs doesn't do any better.   King of Clubs Mini-Golf is yet another attempt at re-creating the miniature sport on Wii, but falls just as short as the rest of the crowd -- or did, when it first arrived on store shelves in the States last summer. That you probably never heard of it or knew it was out speaks well to its lack of impact on its genre, though it tried its best to set itself apart with a ridiculous storyline and a set of grown men in full costume as its golfers.  The premise presented is that Bubba, a less-than-sane Elvis impersonator, has come into a windfall of cash that he uses to construct a miniature golf utopia somewhere in the middle of an uninhabited desert. Then, not wanting to simply hit the little links by his lonesome, he organizes a small tournament for five of his friends -- and forces them to dress up in ridiculous outfits to thematically match his five differently-decorated mini-golf courses. The winner of the tourney gets declared as the King of Clubs. The prize, however, certainly won't be a return of the victor's lost dignity.   Miniature golf, the game of pharaohs.  It's a narrative that ultimately has little bearing on how the game plays out, and works as little more than a loose tie-together for all of the varied courses and characters. The selection could have benefited from some stronger shoring up, too, as individually each hole and human are pretty generic -- the landscapes are all simplistic, looking intentionally constructed out of cheap cardboard cut-outs, and the players are all equally lifeless. You've got a guy in a caveman get-up, and another in a spaceman suit. Thrilling.  King of Clubs could have brought it all back together with a solid gameplay engine and control style, though, as the window dressing never matters much when a game gets its handling right -- but, again, this too is below average. The way motion control is shoehorned into the control scheme is unnatural, and making even the simplest shots is unwieldy.  The system is like this -- you line up your shot with the D-Pad, as an on-screen guide line shows you the direction your ball with travel after it's hit. You then strike your best Wii Sports Golf pose, holding the Remote like a club, pointing at the floor. The A Button tells the game to begin registering your backwards swinging motion as you fill an on-screen power meter, while a second press of A sets and locks the power at the desired level. Then, finally, one last swing of the Remote sends the ball sailing.  It sounds like it would work -- it doesn't. And that's because the motion controlled parts of the process actually aren't controlled by your motions at all. They're entirely arbitrary. After you press A to begin your swing, you're supposed to swing the Remote backwards to set the power, right? But you don't have to. You can swing it back, and forth, and spin it in circles. All the while the power meter on the screen will dance around, filling and depleting itself until you've gotten bored. You can go for minutes, if you like, before you finally press A to lock the power level. There's no timing to it at all.  And, then, the final swing doesn't matter either -- it has no bearing on your shot, since the direction and power have already been determined. It's just another arbitrary motion tacked on, completely unnecessary to the action that's occurring in front of you.  There's a standard set of extra options to be found in King of Clubs, from unlockable putters, courses and characters to multiplayer modes and all the rest. But, really, with an unattractive presentation and a control scheme that actually makes the simulation of the sport feel worse for having included motion elements, few players will likely stick around long enough to explore the depth of the product ... or invite their friends to be disappointed too.",

        "Content": "High refresh rates are the latest buzz in the monitor world and the Asus VG248QE (See it on Amazon) / (See it on Amazon UK) is a solidly built, entry-level model that runs at 144Hz and is a good introduction to the world beyond 60Hz. It's a bit more expensive than competing models but performed well in our benchmarking and hands-on testing. Before we jump in, let's take a look at the baseline specs, as supplied by the manufacturer:   Design and Features The Asus VG248QE (See it on Amazon)  is a 24-inch widescreen LED gaming monitor with a black chassis and a sturdy round base with handy cord-keeper attached. It comes with a dual-link DVI cable, audio cable, power cord, quick start guide, support CD, and warranty card that explains the details of its generous three years of coverage. While the monitor also has DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, you'll have to supply your own cables. Keep in mind that the maximum refresh rate is available only when using DisplayPort or DVI input and is also dependent on your computer's graphics card. There are also no USB ports so you'll have to tether your gaming mouse and keyboard to a computer or go wireless.

Asus ROG Keris II Ace Michael Higham  As far as ergonomic adjustments go, the VG248QE offers options in every direction and is very easy to adjust. It can be swiveled by 45 degrees left and right, pivoted 90 degrees (landscape or portrait), and tilted forward 15 degrees and backward 5 degrees, and its height can also be adjusted by 4.3 inches. It has built-in 2-watt stereo speakers, but you'll probably want to upgrade to dedicated set because they are weak and better than nothing, but that's about it. You can access brightness, contrast, color saturation, skin, and color temperature using hotkeys on the bottom right of the bezel as well as enable customized viewing modes for theater, gaming, night view and others. It has some quirky features just for gaming too, including one named GamePlus that lets you choose between four different crosshair types depending on the game. It's good for honing your skills or if you're new to first-person shooters. You can also enable an onscreen timer if you want to limit gameplay time, which is a bizarre inclusion. The VG248QE also supports 3D gaming and movie watching, but glasses are not included. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate but lacks any type of adaptive refresh technology such as AMD's FreeSync or Nvidia's G-Sync, but the benefit is the high refresh rate will work with any GPU. Performance I tested overall and gaming performance using Lagom LCD monitor test pages for black and white levels, color gradient, and response time. The Asus VG248QE performed well with impressive black levels, only flagging at the darker end of the spectrum. It also excelled in white saturation, struggling only at the brighter end of the spectrum. Banding is an issue that can occur in gaming, in which color and brightness variations show lines and bands rather than smooth color. The Lagom test uses grayscale gradients, and a poor monitor will show not just bands, but color when it can't render the image properly. The Asus passed this test with flying colors.  For response time, which measures how well a monitor reacts to changes on the screens, essential in fast-paced gaming, the Lagom test uses patterns with pixels that are switched on and off. When viewed from a distance, these flashing patterns are undetectable on the best monitors. The Lagom test features eight patterns, and when viewed on the Asus, the flashing was imperceptible or barely noticeable in half of the patterns and gradually became more apparent in the other four.

        "Content": "Horn is the mobile game that hardcore gamers have been waiting for. Developer Phosphor Games has finally cracked the code, creating a fully explorable 3D action/adventure controlled almost entirely with touch-screen gestures. Gamers play as the titular character Horn, a young Blacksmith’s apprentice who wakes up in a mysterious tower to learn that all other living beings have been turned into mechanical monstrosities. The story takes a back seat to the gameplay, but Horn’s central mystery kept me intrigued thanks to its excellent voice acting and a few genuinely surprising twists and turns. Horn isn’t an open-world game – the adventure is split into a collection of semi-linear stages. But the game’s impeccable art design and excellent sense of imagination still manage to make each level’s puzzle & combat rooms a joy to explore. Horn’s intuitive touch-powered controls make exploring the game world a simple pleasure. When out of combat players simply tap where they want to move. Other controls are handled contextually. To leap huge gaps players must tap the approaching ledge in midair. Carefully sliding left and right on the touch screen lets player shimmy along tight ledges. Tapping to move can create moments of awkwardness though, since you can only move to a spot that’s already on-screen. This means that Horn can’t walk backwards, for example.  Did we like it? It’s impossible to talk about Horn without addressing just how gorgeous the game is. Sunlight streams through windows, trees sway lazily in the wind and huge, hulking beasts casually watch on from the background as you solve puzzles. Occasional issues with texture tiling aside, Horn is brimming with both technical and artistic mastery. The game’s core puzzling gameplay doesn’t set quite as high a standard, however. Most of the puzzles can be solved in just a couple steps, even late in the game. Horn feels a lot like the first or second dungeon in a Zelda title. Expect to flip a lot of switches and shoot a lot of arrows through open flames to light torches or burn down barriers. Thankfully a handful of meatier puzzles sure to make even veteran gamers scratch their chin are peppered throughout, although I still wish there were more. Combat, the game’s other major pillar, fares better. Players automatically enter combat mode any time they approach an enemy and can tap left or right to dodge-roll out of the way of incoming attacks and the then counter-attack with a flurry of touch-powered sword swipes of their own. It starts simple, but each enemy has its own attack patterns and quirks to figure out. Later opponents and boss fights require a careful approach and have trickier, better-guarded weaknesses. The entire system works great  - landing the final blow after deftly dodging all of an enemy’s attacks always feels satisfying. Horn’s biggest drawback is its repetitive nature. Rooms, enemies and sometimes entire game segments will show up multiple times. It happens often enough that it becomes possible to predict when a treasure chest or other landmark will be waiting around the next corner. Horn’s huge adventure wasn’t created with a copy & paste mentality, but the lack of variety does put a slight damper on lengthy play sessions. I also encountered one serious progress-stopping bug in Horn’s review build, but a Phosphor representative told me they were aware of the issue and a day 1 patch has been issued to resolve it.  Should you buy it? Horn is this year’s most impressive iOS game yet. Many gamers might balk at its $6.99 asking price, with memories of awkward iOS games that do their best to copy their console big brothers swimming in their head. But Horn is a game thoughtfully designed from the ground-up with touch control in mind, and it shows. Horn isn’t perfect - action/adventure veterans specifically might find the experience a little too simple and light. But the game still serves as an impressive example of what can be accomplished when a talented team takes full advantage of modern mobile devices.",

        "Content": "In most squad-based games, communication is king. In Post Scriptum, that’s taken to new heights: the need for constant coordination with your team is not only necessary for success, but easily the most enjoyable aspect of this World War 2 military simulation. This formula of squad-based team cohesion on steroids would make for a worthwhile shooter were it not for the frustrating maps, overly simplistic game mode, and a few baffling design decisions that get in the way of experiencing what Post Scriptum does well.  Post Scriptum is an unforgiving game where some players are inherently more powerful than others, and a single whizzing bullet can unceremoniously end an otherwise uneventful five-minute trek through its WW2-era Netherlands maps. This may sound difficult for difficulty’s sake but this opaque environment is ultimately what drives people to work together: there’s safety in numbers. If you’re gunned down while alone you have absolutely no recourse, but with a section of soldiers (a group of anywhere from four to nine) at your back you can be avenged and revived. And while this incentive also exists in Battlefield 1, the sheer amount of waiting and running required to get back into the action of Post Scriptum makes sticking with your squad feel even more essential. As someone who loves team play, this element was immediately gratifying, but as time pressed on getting back to this baseline of cooperation proved arduous.   Medics are the glue that binds sections together, but another crucial function of a squad – identifying enemies and relaying their direction to your squadmates – is much harder than it should be. Its predecessor, Squad (from partner studio Offworld Industries) is miles ahead in this department thanks to a HUD-integrated compass which makes it easy to instinctively call out the direction of incoming fire. In Post Scriptum, that’s been replaced with a clumsy in-world compass your character holds in his hand and cannot be used on the run. The markings on this era-appropriate antique are microscopic and, most annoyingly, affected by the surrounding light to the point of total illegibility at night. The compass and its situational usability are realistic, but the tradeoffs in terms of gameplay are huge. I ended up defaulting to the immersion-breaking real-time map to orientate myself, which meant that something as frequently necessary as calling out enemy locations brought the action to a grinding halt. I never felt incentivized to do anything other than make a beeline for the one objective, which is repetitive and one-note. “  The other major detractor from team play – and gameplay in general – is the setting. I had few issues tracking down enemies in Squad’s comparatively barren forests and deserts, but the unending labyrinth of tall hedgerows that abound in all of Post Scriptum’s maps make the prospect of traveling between control points a straight-up nightmare. While these maps may be a faithful recreation of the Netherlands in the 1940s they make an abysmal arena when it comes to video game firefights. On more than one occasion, when acting as a subordinate, my commanding officer ordered that we simply ignore enemies firing at us from inside these hedgerows, since tracking them down was a laborious waste of time. This proved to be the right call, since Post Scriptum’s primary mode is a single capture-point game that’s dominated by tunnel vision.  Because objectives must be captured one at time, with occupied control points permanently changing ownership once captured, the prevailing tactic is an all-out blitz. And while that certainly sounds era-appropriate, it boils down to cramming as many players onto a single capture point as possible, as quickly as possible. I take issue with that for a number of reasons: – first and foremost, this linear mode leaves little room for improvisation or strategy. I never felt incentivized to do anything other than make a beeline for the one objective, which is repetitive and one-note. There is certainly value in finding an enemy mobile spawn point or forward operating base, but the reward – temporarily disrupting the enemy team’s spawns – was never worth the risk of leaving the capture point unprotected, as it can be permanently claimed in what seems like the blink of an eye.   Secondly, this mode does a poor job of leveraging Post Scriptum’s impressive array of multi-crewed tanks, armored cars, deployables, and soldier roles. I thought the idea of serving in a logistics section might be an interesting change of pace, but found that setting up lines of sandbags and machine gun nests simply wasn’t practical for how frequently the frontlines shifted. Similarly, I only found armored cars to be useful at the beginning of a match since transportation to the active capture point wasn’t necessary once the mobile spawn points were deployed. The prospect of piling in the back of a half-track would be infinitely more exciting if there was a reason to go literally anywhere other than the one active capture point. Some maps, like Heelsum, offer a “double” variant with two capture points available at a time, but I have yet to find a server running this version of the map that is populated enough to play.  At the same time, Post Scriptum does plenty of things quite well. The gunplay, for example, feels intuitive and impactful, and the former is no easy feat given the era’s spartan iron sights and primarily bolt-action arsenal. Unlike the rest of the weapons in Post Scriptum, hits with these rifles result in an audible click that provides a rare moment of clarity in an otherwise veiled battlefield. In spite of their modest capability, I ended up falling in love with both of the standard issue rifles: the British Lee Enfield and German Kar98K. Which is just as well, because I got stuck using them more often than not. Post Scriptum has no problem creating interesting platforms for teamwork like tanks and sections; the issue comes in the combination and application of those disparate parts. “  Roles in Post Scriptum are divvied out on a first come, first served basis. The downsides of this system are immediately apparent: the most desirable positions like snipers, machine gunners, and anti-tank infantry fill up very quickly, often leaving you feeling like fodder by handing you a bolt-action rifle on a battlefield dominated by automatic gunfire. But this asymmetrical distribution of power has the massive benefit of creating a dynamic where you and your teammates must work together to offset each others’ weaknesses. The devastating MG42 may be effective when it’s set up, but good luck hitting anything before you’ve deployed the bipod, much less when you’re on the move. In this way, assistance from less powerful but more versatile riflemen is essential for the safe relocation of said machine gunner.   Since each section of infantry gets the same number of specialists, medics, and rifleman, individual weapons don’t need to be precisely balanced against each other to make one-on-one encounters feel fair. In an ecosystem where not everyone can use an StG 44, the versatility afforded by it selective fire feels properly powerful. This squad leader-exclusive weapon may be why I first tried the position, but I stayed with it for the unique experience the leadership role offered. When a squadmate discovered a section of enemy troops garrisoned in an isolated mansion, I relayed their location to my commander who, in turn, called in an airstrike. Afterward, we cleared out the building and I got my first glimpse at what making a difference actually looks like in Post Scriptum.  Another stellar example of team play is the armored division, which in total has access to a dozen tanks including the Tiger E1 and Sherman Firefly. Since the engine and turret are operated independently, crewing a tank requires Overcooked-levels of perpetual (and sometimes very colorful) communication. While it certainly takes some getting used to. I found the hassle to be well worth the effort from both a standpoint of effectiveness and fun.",

Farm Frenzy is a mess of ideas – you start off in each level with the task of making grass grow so that your farm animals can eat it. Then they produce products like eggs and milk for you to sell, which you tap on and send to a truck that drives back and forth between a distant city and returns with money. Then you use that money to reinvest in your farm, buying more animals and more water to make more grass grow, and purchasing extraneous buildings to process your products into other products.  And then a bear shows up.    There might have been a good gameplay idea in here somewhere, but what this final product delivers is just confusion – I kind of get it and I kind of don't, and I'm not having fun trying to figure it out. It doesn't help matters that the game does very little to explain what's going on, and it further doesn't help matters that the control seems to be implemented poorly – sometimes you'll tap the ground and grass will grow, other times it won't.

Equally addictive was the disc golf mode packaged into Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10. That game could have cut out all the traditional golfing entirely, and I wouldn't have cared. Frisbees were the focus for me.  So it would seem to be a pretty safe bet to capitalize on the disc golf momentum on Wii, and bring the concept to the WiiWare service for the first time -- but, frighteningly, that's not the case. Zoo Disc Golf only serves to send you running back to the comfort of Wuhu Island or Tiger's woods, as this new take on the same sport is ugly and unappealing.  There are some interesting ideas. There are four different animal characters to play as, and some are taller than the others -- making height an influencing factor in how far above the ground each of your disc tosses begin. The environments, too, have some novel concepts here. Each hole is an animal enclosure at a wacky zoo, and some of them offer off-the-wall challenges you wouldn't see in Wii Sports or Tiger -- like the Shark Tank stage, where you have to throw your frisbee underwater and try to counteract the slowing affect of the disc having to travel through liquid.  But the visuals are rough, the controls limited and the end of each stage annoyingly picky. Each animal character model looks demented, like the sharp-toothed kangaroo that seems to have been poisoned by the Joker's laughing gas. Trying to achieve disc golf precision without the benefit of the Wii MotionPlus peripheral seems to be too challenging, as it's very hard to keep a steady angle registered. And the target area, a small set of chains at the end of every level, can easily deflect your shots -- turning well-played birdies into frustrating bogeys, or worse.",

        "Content": "Games Workshop is best known for its miniatures games, Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar. But these present a significant barrier to new players in terms of digesting rules and collecting a whole army to put into the field. As such, it has long offered cut-down, introductory versions to entice the unwary. The latest is Warhammer 40,000: Fireteam, in which a squad of close-combat Space Marines take on the sinister, robotic Necrons ( see it at Barnes & Noble ). However, Fireteam takes a fresh approach by adopting a stripped-down version of the miniatures rules for what is inarguably a war board game . It has cards, a hex grid and there’s not a range ruler to be seen. What’s in the Box Fireteam doesn’t look like much when you slide off the lid. Underneath a double-sided board, each surface printed with an abstract sci-fi battlefield, are a bunch of nondescript orange and white cards of various sizes. It’s when you realize that the box is deeper than the storage tray that the magic happens. Beneath are three sprues of brilliant miniatures.

The five Marine figures are outstanding, energetic and elegant despite their bulky armor. Their thirteen Necron opponents are harder to assemble and less striking to behold, but still detailed and disquieting. The five Marine figures are outstanding, energetic and elegant despite their bulky armor. “ Among the box contents are rules and cards for four other Fireteams that don’t have included models. They’re all factions from the 40k universe: Tau, Eldar, Orks and Imperial Guard and each corresponds to a single of models you can buy separately. Rules and How It Plays Fireteam uses a simplified version of the Kill Team rules, which are themselves a simplified version of the full Warhammer 40k rules. When you activate a model it gains a certain number of action points it can spend to move and fire. In combat you choose a weapon and roll its specified number of dice, trying to get its to-hit number. The target then rolls its specified number of defense dice, trying to get its armor save number to cancel any hits. Because this is a board game rather than a miniatures game, it can do away with the often clumsy rules required for measured movement. Instead, when you move or check range, you count hexes. To determine a line of sight, you draw a bead from the center of one hex to the middle of the target. It’s clean and fast, as you’d want a firefight game to be. You wouldn’t imagine, however, that such a basic framework would offer many strategies, but Fireteam gets its missions, boards, and cards to do the lifting in this department. There are twelve missions, each supposedly representing the pivotal moment of a larger battle. The introductory one puts the teams in opposite corners, seeking to control two objective hexes. Things escalate from there into terrain interactions, fetch and carry missions, and many more besides. Each gives you particular ways to score points which often have little to do with eliminating enemy combatants. As such, it’s quite common to see your squad decimated and still win, one of several ideas it’s taken from its sister title Warhammer Underworlds. Others include its tight three-turn structure, keeping things tense, and giving each player a hand of objective cards. These give bonus points for fulfilling particular goals, like keeping your models spaced several hexes apart. Fireteam uses a simplified version of the Kill Team rules, which are themselves a simplified version of the full Warhammer 40k rules. “ The two included Fireteams are also very different in character. The Marines are fast and have the edge in melee. The Necrons, by contrast, are lethal at range but have a special rule that means they can’t take the same action twice. In practice this makes them ponderously slow, leaving a single model only able to move six hexes for the entire game. To compensate they have three fast but weak scarab swarms. All the Fireteams have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Alongside the combat stats, each also has three ploys, special abilities of which they can activate one per turn. Those of the Marines center around combat boosts and claiming objectives. The Necrons, meanwhile, can make up for their slow speed by warping a single model across the board or reanimating fallen warriors. Making good use of these at the right time can help to swing the game in your favor. Each mission thus becomes a strategic puzzle in how to use cover, terrain and the unique qualities of your soldiers to achieve objectives. For that first, objective-based mission, the Necrons must work out how they can stop the speedy Marines from claiming those objectives on the first turn and gaining an unstoppable lead. Among other issues, this involves coordinating movement on their crowded starting area to ensure the lumbering robots don’t block each other’s line of sight. Of course, in a three-turn game where every attack and defense pivots on a fistful of dice, “strategy” is perhaps too strong a word. But unless you’re dedicated to the deepest fare, solving each scenario puzzle despite the best efforts of the dice to thwart you offers a pleasing balancing of tension and tactics. Once the best approach to a mission is understood, the dice become more decisive. But the way missions prioritize objectives over kills tends to swing the balance away from combat and toward strategy. Although the asymmetry is a key part of Fireteam’s appeal, it does lead to some rather unintuitive rules. Each side gets to activate eight models per turn, which means that the Marines will end up activating at least one model more than once. A second activation only gets a single action, and you focus all your extra activations on the same model if you want. While this offers some fun tactical possibilities, it simply feels wrong to have a single warrior running halfway across the board and laying down a hail of fire all in the same turn. There’s another aspect that throws a robotic wrench into the otherwise smooth gears of Fireteam, which is the sheer number of counters it uses. Models accrue counters to track wounds, activations and status effects. Stacks of large counters on a crowded board quickly become very hard to track, losing cohesion over which model owns which stack. And at the end of each turn, you must ferret out the non-wound ones without displacing the others. It’s a clumsy, awkward administrative task that sticks out badly in such a fast-playing game.

        "Content": "When I played the original Company of Heroes in 2006, I struggled to think of how a World War II real-time strategy game could look or play a whole lot better than it does. Apparently, so has its developer, Relic, because seven years later Company of Heroes 2 is strikingly similar. There are, of course, subtle visual improvements and numerous hit-or-miss gameplay tweaks as the series transitions from the Western Front to the Eastern, but this is very much a new spin on the same game. Of course, the original CoH has held up remarkably well (if you haven’t played it, you absolutely should) so I welcome something that looks and plays like it with open arms, even if it’s not necessarily a better version.  Because it’s so similar to the original, Company of Heroes 2 is great for all the same reasons. More than most real-time strategy games, CoH is all about using smart tactical positioning to take advantage of cover and exploit weak tank armor. And because armies are rarely more than a dozen units at a time, it has a relatively slower, more methodical pace than a traditional RTS, even though there’s almost always something going on. Its territory-based resource system, now revised to allow you to influence which of the three resources a held point generates, allows a style of play that’s focused almost entirely on tactics. I particularly appreciate the ability to win a battle by attacking an enemy where he’s not, rather than meeting him head-on. I don’t mean to imply that it requires a more tactical mind than a game like StarCraft II, but it’s weighted more toward planning than reflexes in a way that I find rewarding. The detail in the units and world is extravagant. Watching an impressively modeled tank crash through a wall, turn its independently moving turret, and blast an armored car to bits in a spectacular explosion that sends its driver flying through the air and kicks up a huge cloud of smoke and debris with a deafening boom is really astonishing. Each infantry unit is animated and voiced in a lifelike way, and equipped with unique uniforms and weapons. Watching your soldiers set up and fire a heavy machine gun or mortar is a treat, and hearing their heavily accented chatter and convincing screams of pain in combat makes it easy to get attached to veteran squads, even though they’re nameless fodder. The German force in CoH2 is a tweaked version of what we saw in CoH and works in mostly the same way, but the new Soviet Red Army has a fresh, unique style that reflects the manpower advantage they had in the war. Reinforcing units on the front lines by filling the ranks from conscript squads demands more hands-on management than the Germans’ traditional method of relying on Halftracks for a trickle of front-line reinforcements, but it comes with the interesting tradeoff of allowing elite squads to instantly return to full strength that makes that effort worthwhile. The Soviets get several other advantages, including two-man sniper teams that will always trump a single German sniper in a duel (because the Soviets can take a hit and still shoot back), and those can be a real benefit to players who like to harass. A lengthy 14-mission single-player campaign (all from the Russian side) goes from the Soviets’ desperate defense against the Nazis’ advance on Stalingrad all the way to the fall of Berlin in 1945. If you know your history, you know it’s a grim ride. Relic makes an effort to soften the historical horror show by framing the Soviet campaign as the tale of good men fighting to defend their homeland rather than for the ideals of a mass-murdering dictator (the same trick employed in the Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts expansion). Nevertheless, it has a bad habit of rewarding my hard-fought victories with a harsh dose of depressing historical reality. Did someone do something selfless and noble? Comrade Stalin’s not going to like that. But Relic didn’t write history, and to sugarcoat the horrors of the Eastern Front would’ve been a much greater sin. It’s a campaign that, as a whole, is mostly a retread of what worked in Company of Heroes – a series of search-and-destroy and holdout defense objectives. It’s competent and challenging, but holds few surprises and never really rises to the same level of the original. Only one mission, in which badly outgunned Soviet infantry have to take down a virtually invulnerable Tiger tank that chases them through the streets of a town in a game of heavily armored cat and mouse, really stood out to me as inspired. It showcases the new true line-of-sight system nicely by encouraging you to ambush the Tiger and lure it into mines, but also makes you uncertain of its precise location. Snow is the other major new mechanic introduced, but other than adding some beauty and diversity to the landscape and lending authenticity to the setting (where the brutal cold arguably had almost as much to do with defeating the Nazis as the Soviets did) I found the increased micromanagement needed to keep infantry alive to be engaging for a total of one level before it was simply restrictive. After having played two StarCraft II campaigns since the last Company of Heroes, the intermittent blizzards that threaten to freeze troops to death if left in the open felt like a gimmick that should’ve kicked in for one level and then gone away before they wore out their welcome.  I’m also not overjoyed at the dramatic lethality of flamethrowers, particularly the ones affixed to the German halftrack trucks as an upgrade. They’re counterable by any anti-tank weapon, so I can’t call them unbalanced, but the speed with which they deep-fry multiple infantry units out of existence disrupts the slower, more tactical pacing I love about CoH. Generally you have time to recover from being caught off guard and recall your men to base before they’re completely wiped out to preserve their veterancy status, but flames can rob you of those prized troops in the blink of an eye. Oh, and flames ignore cover. Some of the best stuff in Company of Heroes 2 is in the Theater of War modes, which have both single-player and co-op challenges where you can compete for high scores on leaderboards. Some are basic holdout missions, but others are more creative. In one, you use Soviet rocket trucks to obliterate as many German-held and neutral buildings as possible to scorch the earth behind a retreat; in another, you use a small squad of German armor to capture at least 10 points on a large map. What I want to know is: why weren’t these mission objectives included in the campaign? They feel like campaign missions and are much more interestingly designed. I do like that they’re broken out here for easy repeated play, though. Every mission you complete in the campaign and Theater of War gives you a set of medals that appear on your profile page - part of a life-extending persistent metagame Relic’s built around leveling yourself up to unlock bonuses and vehicle skins. As a rule, I’m generally opposed to unlocks of any kind in an RTS, as a perfectly level playing field should be the goal of any competitive strategy game. Here, at least, the earned bonuses are small enough to be nearly imperceptible to most players - a 2% bonus to a given unit’s firepower isn’t going to make the difference for the non-hardcore. (The hardcore players are likely to level up quickly anyway.)  Competitive multiplayer maps are plentiful, and broken down into winter and summer varieties. Those infantry-hampering blizzards only happen on the former, so they’re available as a good, optional change of pace. The most divisive change to multiplayer, though, is the revised Commander Abilities system, which is now less of a tree and more a series of linear tracks that you pick between early in a match. It results in locking you into a set of abilities, such as the German Festung Support Doctrine that grants abilities like off-map artillery and auto-reinforcing infantry, or the Soviet Guard Motor Coordination Tactics, which is an armor specialization that can summon medium tanks and debuff enemy armor. The new system limits your ability to pivot your strategy mid-game if you’re caught off guard. But as one of my long-standing issues with Company of Heroes is having to make selections while my tanks are exploding behind the menu that fills the screen, this new system is not without its charms. I’m more concerned about its future use as an avenue for DLC - allowing players to purchase alternate tracks with new abilities seems like an invitation to introduce balance issues. But that’s a hypothetical. So at least this system isn’t likely to do significant harm to the balance, and may give completionist players a reason to keep jumping into multiplayer for months. If it works as the similar system in League of Legends and its ilk has, the CoH2 multiplayer community could see a lively old age. Relic definitely seems to have built Company of Heroes 2 to last well after the campaign ends, and has even integrated Twitch.tv support for streaming and watching competitive games.",

        "Content": "Video games can be great vehicles for mysteries. The idea of gathering clues, questioning witnesses, and giving dramatic speeches where you stun an array of suspects with your intellect makes for an exciting fantasy. But lots of games stumble trying to fit the inherently open-ended, red-string-connecting fantasy of the detective into traditionally linear story structures. The Inquisitor is a game like that — it starts with the compelling concept of playing as a medieval church cop hunting a vampire, but it always puts the strings on the board for you, and thus never really lives up to the potential of its premise. It is quite a premise, though. As inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin, you've been dispatched to investigate the citizens of a European town called Koenigstein. What's more, the story is based on the dark fantasy novels of Polish writer Jacek Piekara, imagining an alternate religious history of Christianity in which Jesus Christ wasn't a martyr, but instead broke free of his crucifixion and led a vengeful army to conquer the Roman Empire. The Inquisitor Gameplay Screenshots 25 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It feels a bit like you've stepped into Star Trek's Mirror Universe as you begin The Inquisitor, with characters describing how mercilessness, retribution, and the ends justifying the means are virtues of their religion. For a story-driven game that promises tough decisions to make in conversations and interrogations, it's an excellent setup. Lots of games will put \"moral\" questions to you, but I've never seen another use its worldbuilding to change the rules underlying that morality. What you consider moral in our reality may not be what characters consider moral in this one, and you might need to worry about how others will interpret your actions in ways you don't expect. At least, that's the underlying idea of The Inquisitor, but it doesn't ever really land that feeling. The consequences of your actions shake out pretty much the way you'd expect them to whether you’re nice to people or mean to them — or at least, that's how it seemed to me over two complete playthroughs, the first of which took me around eight hours. How and when your choices affect the story isn’t particularly clear in most cases in The Inquisitor, and its mostly linear, straightforward structure makes it really difficult to tell if and when you're able to move things in different directions. Having exactly what you're looking for lit up is helpful, but removes any critical thinking. “ That said, the story The Inquisitor tells is a fairly compelling one, at least for most of its runtime. The writing is largely solid, with interesting characters that are mostly portrayed pretty well by the large voice cast, although a few look at you with animatronic-like eyes that seem like they're trying to escape their heads. But Koenigstein’s art direction successfully gives it a dirty, lived-in atmosphere. It's generally bigger than it needs to be in a way that makes it feel like a town , not a gameplay space that only exists to hold your objectives. The drawback is that the town is so big that most of your time is spent sprinting from one end to the other as you chase the next plot point. As an investigator, you'll eavesdrop on conversations, examine murder victims, and scope out crime scenes from time to time, and these moments generally tell you exactly how many clues to gather before you can move on. Most of your clue-collecting ability comes from The Inquisitor's version of Detective Vision; when Mordimer prays, the landscape goes gray and important elements like your destination, collectible notes, clues, or scent trails you can follow are all highlighted. Vision modes like The Inquisitor's always seem like a necessary evil, since it can be tough to spot small details in a busy world, but that didn’t stop praying from feeling like a crutch whenever I used it. It's difficult to tell what's interactive and what isn't or to see details like a blood trail leading to a suspect without highlighting them, but having exactly what you're looking for lit up orange all the time removes any requirement for critical thinking. Do you pick \"good\" or \"evil\" choices in games? Good — I like to be a paragon of virtue Evil — I like to see how dark things can get It depends — I pick what makes sense for my character Either — I go for the most interesting options Both — I'll play one way and then the other to see all the differences Answer See Results You have more agency through your conversation choices, particularly in interviews and interrogations. People are often lying to you, so whether you're nice or brusque can determine how forthcoming they'll be. At the same time, it's tough to see where the failure points are or if you've messed up. In one interrogation, in which Mordimer has a guy strapped to a torture chair, you can take the suspect at his word or increase the pain. I played this scene twice, varying my approach the second time knowing I'd gotten false information before. This time, I got some additional answers I could also vet with my knowledge of later scenes — but Mordimer gave up the interrogation basically right afterward, indicating I'd learned all I could, and he still treated information I knew was false as if it was a good lead. So the extra info didn't actually lead to anything new, and I was still left chasing a lie. The reason Mordimer always follows the wrong tack is that it pushes you into one of The Inquisitor's more action-focused levels in a place called the Unworld. Mordimer can project himself into a sort of astral plane populated by monsters, where it's possible to piece together visions of past events and learn what actually happened, free of the lies and confusions of the people you're interrogating. These sequences give Mordimer a supernatural cheat code, providing information he shouldn't otherwise have, but they also make a lot of those clue hunts and interrogations feel unnecessary. Why bother asking people for answers and wonder if they're lying if you're just going to use magic anyway? Once I realized I could sprint through the Unworld, it ceased to be stressful. “ The Unworld puts you in a twisted, dark reflection of Koenigstein where you're constantly avoiding the detection of a flying eyeball called the Murk while you search for five pieces of a vision to trigger a cutscene. To avoid the Murk's searching gaze, you'll need to dip under overhangs and pick the right paths through the Unworld. More interesting aspects are added over time, such as sword-wielding enemies and black mist that slows you down while alerting the Murk to your presence, and you’ll even unlock useful abilities like a blast of light to temporarily blind it. But while the first one or two of these levels are tense and spooky, it quickly becomes apparent that enemies are predictable enough that you can pretty much just sprint  straight to each objective. Once I figured out there was nothing stopping me from running full-speed around the Unworld, these segments ceased to be stressful. Lack of challenge thanks to general clunkiness is a problem throughout The Inquisitor, weakening its otherwise decent ideas. There are several times when you'll engage in sword fights, a system that includes standard things like light and heavy attacks, a quick dodge, the ability to block, and a parry that opens enemies up to counter-attacks. Theoretically, duels should be tense dances where you identify your opponent's moves and react with the appropriate counter. But I won just about every fight by executing one or two perfect parries and then overwhelming my opponent with a flurry of strikes. The Inquisitor has a couple of more difficult boss fights against more interesting enemies, but most of the battles are easily won because enemies just can't keep up with you. Action sequences aren't the main thrust of The Inquisitor, though. Easy fights and simplistic quick-time events could be forgiven, as could blobby faces and minor gaffes like characters clipping into one another, if the investigation and story were strong enough. But those don't give you enough agency to feel satisfying; Mordimer always tells you exactly where to go and what to do next. When I hit my first (bad) ending after eight hours, a character chided me for allowing events to transpire that led to a bad outcome. But after a second playthrough, I'm still not sure where I messed up, except for a particular conversation where I was supposed to stall for time but didn't stall enough; I had no way of knowing which choices would have stalled more than others, either. (Autosaves stop you from save-scumming in The Inquisitor, and after two attempts at this sequence, I wasn't willing to play through the whole game a third time for another shot at it.) Even when I made specific choices with the benefit of hindsight — like choosing to avoid a fight I knew would get one character killed, resulting in another character later trying to kill Mordimer as revenge — that later scene still played out as if that person had been killed. There are a few distinct choices that lead to different situations like this one, but they didn't seem to materially affect the story, and I never saw opportunities to search for different clues or follow alternate leads.

The Inquisitor's best sequence takes you into a maze-like dungeon, where you confront a murderous jester who's constantly rhyming and playing a flute. This guy is creepy , and when you find him dismembering a victim, he disappears among the jail cells, forcing you to follow his taunts emanating from the shadows. You can light torches as you search, but the jester will attack you if you wait in the shadows too long. The presentation of the scene is excellent, making it legitimately frightful. The dinginess of the dungeon under torchlight, the cackling couplets from the darkness, and the escalation of the moment as another character shows up for the jester to target instead, all made for something that was really fun, tense, and spooky — until I got lost in the maze. For some reason, the prayer ability didn't work throughout this sequence, so in a later portion when there are no sounds to follow, I was stuck just running around the dungeon, trying to figure out what The Inquisitor wanted me to do. Prompts even appeared to tell me to use the prayer ability to see where I should be going, but it just didn't work. Eventually, I stumbled on the solution when I happened to pass an item that gave me a contextual button prompt, but by then, all the tension and fright had been drained out.",

        "Content": "Need for Speed has long been one of EA's bread and butter franchises, though the ratio of bread to butter has changed a number of times over the years. In other words, it's almost constantly changing from one iteration to the next, sometimes for the betterment of the series, and sometimes not. The latter is the case for Need for Speed Undercover , a game that feels a little lost in its focus and design.  Whereas last year's Need for Speed ProStreet moved away from open world racing and focused entirely on multiple event-based showdowns, its less than stellar final showing sent Black Box back to the drawing board, so Undercover heads back to open city racing replete with cop chases. It also brings back a focus on storytelling, with you playing the part of an undercover agent aiming to take down a crime syndicate with ties to street racing. Unfortunately, none of this design really comes together in any sort of coherent fashion, and the game is so riddled with technical problems that it holds back any shimmer of light that there might have been.   That car wasn't there a second ago. Part of the issue here is how the open world racing is handled. In many events, the game actually closes off your city access with barriers and only lets you drive on the predefined track. This means that you can't take your own custom route through the city for the longer events, which is somewhat of a shame, and it also means you won't have to deal with cross traffic.  Speaking of traffic, the world of Undercover is apparently populated by folks without jobs or places to go as you'll rarely see any other vehicles on the road. How can you have a racing game set in an open city and not have cross traffic to deal with, or even many cars to dodge?  Oh, but that's not where the problems with traffic end. One of the game's bigger technical issues is that while the framerate largely stays steady, the draw distance suffers greatly for it, especially with regards to the barren traffic. Cars in the distance will first appear simply as shadows, and as you close in, the cars will magically appear out of the Netherworld right in front of you. I'm not talking about a quarter-mile down the road, but more on the order of 200 feet. At high speeds, this doesn't leave you much time to react, though at least there isn't much traffic to contend with. Sigh.  The visuals also pose problems with actually navigating the environment as some segments don't get drawn in until you get close to them. Also, the visual fidelity of the game on the whole is poor enough that it can be hard to discern the road from a same-colored wall. It just doesn't look good on the whole, and it's bad enough that it affects your ability to drive well.   Is that dirt or the game? In terms of the actual driving mechanics, there are problems here too. My main gripe is that cars don't power slide as well as they should, and I'm not even looking for something on the order of Ridge Racer. It's harder to throw out the back end of a car in the game than the real thing, which can make taking turns at high speed a bit of a problem. Handling is uninspired overall, more functional than fun and charismatic.  Collisions with the environment also hamper the driving experience to a degree at times. For instance, you'll try to power slide around a turn, wind up sliding into a curved barrier and instead of deflecting off of it and simply losing some speed, you'll come to a complete stop. This would make sense in a head-on collision, of course, but not if you're glancing off an object with your back end.",

        "Content": "1-2-Switch is a totally bizarre party game that made me laugh much harder than similar collections like Wario Ware or Mario Party, but I’m still not sure if I was laughing at it or with it. The assortment of 28 diverse mini-games seems to exist to show off the fidelity of the sensors on the Joy-Con controllers, and they do, but the remarkably unique games lack any real depth.  The weirdness starts at the very beginning. Each individual game is introduced with a fairly well-produced live-action trailer-slash-tutorial that gives you an idea of the overall tone and mechanics. They’re color coordinated and neatly cut, but seem to be advertisements for the individual game modes more than helpful tutorials. Some are really bad at communicating what you’re supposed to do, and as a result a lot of your first play sessions will probably involve a whole lot of people saying ‘wait, what am I supposed to do here?’   Even when you do have an understanding of how different games work, some, like the baseball mini-game, are confusing. You know one of you has to bat and one of you has to pitch, but it doesn’t tell you what sounds to listen for to swing and hit the virtual ball at the right time, plus you can actually get caught out, which seems like it might happen at random. When you’re the batter, a virtual player on a non-existent field can ‘catch’ the ball you hit, and I was never able to tell the physical difference between a successful swing and a losing one. It never communicated that with me.  Baby is one of the most off-putting mini-games I've ever played. “  Other games like Gorilla, Baby, and Zen serve very little appeal beyond the novelty of how odd they are. Gorilla has you pound your chest to a simple beat - something you could do without a Joy-Con if you really wanted – but you probably don’t. Baby has you take the console out of the dock and hold it like a baby, rocking it slowly until it stops crying, and then setting it down without waking it up. And it does seem to genuinely be the audio of a baby crying, which automatically makes it one of the most off-putting mini-games I think I’ve ever played. Zen has you sit perfectly still or hold a particular pose, or just put the Joy-Con down - the Switch largely can’t tell the difference.

One of my favorite games has you move the controller up, down, left, and right if the in-built female voice commands it, but you have to do the opposite if the male voice says it. That game is, in the right setting, competitive and fun, but it’s odd to have a party game you can’t play at an actual party where people are talking or listening to music.   And yet, the things that do work make people laugh much more than most. Even after four hours experiencing all of 1-2-Switch’s absurdities with a small group I didn’t feel bored of the selection of games, and I easily could’ve added a few more hours of playing the simple reflex contest of Quick Draw on top of that.  It offers an oddly personal competitive experience. “  Even if it’s laughter at the expense of someone chomping on absolutely nothing just for the Joy-Con to pick up how many virtual sandwiches they’ve eaten, 1-2-Switch offers an oddly personal competitive experience that’s tailored to your own social setting. At some point during our Switch party, we figured out that making a B sound while opening and closing your mouth seems to help you move faster, which resulted in a room full of people trying it out and trying to beat the previous person’s score, all the while making totally ridiculous “bababababa” sounds. We laughed so, so hard at Milk - the game where you milk a virtual cow - and the unnatural, frankly overtly sexual motions it forces you into, all the while encouraging increasingly awkward eye contact between the two players.  Beyond humor, there’s also a degree of wonderment in discovering exactly how the hardware works. Ball Count still seems like magic to me, in that it has you count the amount of small virtual balls that are present in the Joy-Con based on simulation through precise vibration and sound. It’s an interesting demonstration of the Switch’s “high-definition haptics” technology and it’s worth trying once or twice, but I don’t think a whole lot of people will repeatedly come back to it. It’s more gimmicky than anything, because when you think about it it’s literally just simulating marbles in a box.   There are a few different modes, too, including a shuffle mode that plays different games at random and a virtual board game that increases the usual number of players by encouraging you to split up into teams and pass the controllers around. In that, it’s inclusive and adaptable, and I think even people who’ve never played a game before could become wholly comfortable with 1-2-Switch in a matter of hours.  That said, I think this is a game you show to people once, when you’re trying to introduce them to the Switch, and then probably never again. It’s fun, and I’ve repeatedly seen it entertain a room full of people who might not even be playing, but the novelty quickly wears off, and I ultimately think it should've been included in a bundle for free.",

        "Content": "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ? is essentially Who Wants to Be a Millionaire with the added feature of feeling dumb when you get a question wrong. After all, a fifth grader could have answered that, right? Remove the whole showmanship out of the equation – you know, the little kids berating you for being so stupid – and you're left with a shallow quiz game. That's what the Nintendo DS rendition is. It's not terrible but it definitely lacks the charm of the television show production.  There's not much to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader, and breaking the idea down to its basics just shows how lightweight the concept is, and just how important all the television stage glitz is to expand it to an hour long show. It's just a bunch of multiple choice or true/false questions of elementary school levels of difficulty, aimed at showing just how much or little you paid attention in class. The addition of Millionaire-like lifelines extend the concept, like the ability to use a fifth grader's answer as your own.  Clearly the game was rushed to market, just in case the television show tanked. Jeff Foxworthy and the five selectable kids look to have been rendered by art school dropouts using a freeware 3D program. Luckily you don't have to look at the poorly lipsynching Foxworthy muppet for long since he only shows up on camera to introduce the game and to set off the Million Dollar Question. At least he continues his game show chatter for much of the game. Sure, they're relegated to the \"here is your question\" basics as well as the generic introduction script, but at the very least the game designers wrangled the \"You might be a redneck if…\" comedian for a few hours in the recording booth. Why they didn't do the same for the five kids in the game...   I don't think even Poser Foxworthy knows the answer to this one.   Getting a question incorrect isn't as humiliating as it would be simply because Jeff's comments are one shot deals. Sure, you're not standing on a stage in front of thousands of people, but insults sort of lose their impact when they're said over and over and over again.  At least there's a decent line-up of questions in the DS cartridge. According to THQ there are more than 3000 questions in Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader, but because they're spread out among 28 different grade school subjects, basic math suggests that you'll see a repeat question rather quickly. The game is apparently under a randomizer and doesn't record when you've already seen a question, so don't be surprised if you quickly find a repeat question in only two or three games.  Throughout the entirety of the quiz game your questions are multiple choice. The exception is the Million Dollar Question, where you have to spell out your answer. But the designers didn't apply any room for error; you answer it the way it's in the database or you're wrong. In one game, our question was \"Mark Twain's a pen name for…\" and entering in \"Sam Clemens\" triggered a \"Wrong! It's Samuel Clemens.\" Sorry guys, Sam Clemens should work too. I'd hate to see what other answers are not allowed in this cartridge.",

        "Content": "You ever see someone with massive, toned arms but embarrassingly scrawny legs? Digimon Survive is a little bit like that person: it overwhelmingly succeeds at being an entertaining visual novel, but completely skips leg day when it comes to its tedious tactics combat. Apart from some serious pacing problems, meeting Digimon Survive’s memorable characters and exploring the grim world they are in make the story at its center very enjoyable. But while this visual novel digivolves in the areas of storytelling and characterization, the slow and mind-numbingly simplistic turn-based combat system crammed into it comes close to spoiling that otherwise enjoyable tale entirely. The glacial opening hours of Digimon Survive feature a group of quirky high school students who are sucked into a parallel world that’s filled with Digimon. That’ll be a familiar setup for any Digimon fan, but a much darker tone and a new cast of characters means that’s just about where the similarities end. Digimon has always dabbled with dark themes, but what follows here is an unsettling tale filled with intense and traumatic backstories, physical and verbal abuse, psychotic episodes, betrayal, and gruesome deaths, all next to the usual colorful cartoon mascots who turn into sexy humanoids through the power of friendship. Tone Control Police? Yeah, I’d like to report a murder. Digimon Survive Screens (English Language version) 10 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The perilous story of Digimon Survive sees these students and their destined Digimon partners trying to survive the mysterious and dangerous world they now find themselves in while searching for a way to return to their own. Unfortunately they are also surrounded by evil and sadistic Digimon who are into killing children and monologuing about how much they like killing children in equal measure. It’s a weird ride to be sure, but also one that’s thoroughly enjoyable. And although it can be jarring at times, Digimon Survive does benefit from both its dark tone and the incredibly high stakes it sets. For example, characters can be killed off in horrifyingly gruesome ways because you didn’t spend enough time developing a relationship with them. Naturally, this transforms them into the worst version of themself and their death is all your fault for being a bad friend. Those stakes work very well in a visual novel that puts its characters front and center, especially since the Digimon franchise has always leaned heavily on the saving-the-world-through-the-power-of-friendship trope – this time there’s just a lot more murdering going on. The art style is fantastic as long as you're outside of combat. “ All of that murder looks fantastic too, thanks to an anime art style that made me forget I wasn’t watching a Digimon TV show half of the time. Characters are incredibly crisp and expressive – so much so that I almost forgave the lack of an English voice option, which I generally prefer. It’s just too bad that I got used to such stellar graphics in the storytelling sections that make up most of the adventure, because every time I then jumped to the low-res textures and overly-simplistic character models of its tactical gameplay sections the whiplash would nearly break my neck. Digimon Survive’s music is also generally high quality, though there are only a handful of tracks that play over and over again throughout the roughly 40-hour runtime, so unfortunately I ended up sick of them by the end. A Slow Death As a visual novel first and foremost, Digimon Survive has you doing by-the-numbers activities like finding hidden objects and building up social links with your comrades, but the story around those things is largely pretty awesome. It’s got some memorable characters, a unique setting, and more than a few neat twists and turns (though admittedly I saw many of its reveals coming from a mile away). You’ll get to hang out with some likable, if a bit one-dimensional, human companions like the level-headed mother hen Aoi and the talkative goofball Minoru, as well as the much more interesting Digimon characters like the ever-lovable Agumon and the surprisingly mature and stern Falcomon. Digimon Survive has got real storytelling chops at all the right times too, and the pivotal moments where it flexes them account for some of the adventure's best. The biggest problem with the story is that it moves at a snail’s pace most of the time, with lots of meaningless filler padding out its chapters and characters who absolutely refuse to stop rehashing the same things over and over again – so much so that I was screaming “I get it already” at my television. The opening couple of hours in particular are so oppressively slow that it left an incredibly bad first impression until things finally started developing down the road. But just as things did get going, the fun police would inevitably arrive to shove some needlessly drawn out conversation down my throat. One section had me walking through the identical halls of a waterway to discover the same illusory figures repeatedly (which somehow fooled my character every time, naturally), while another had me bouncing back and forth between a handful of areas as I chased around a group of characters who would argue with me briefly before running off to be chased again. There’s just a ton of wheel spinning that happens in between the otherwise interesting story developments, which bogs down the whole experience. Thankfully, the relationships you build as you work your way through this world’s mysteries pay dividends and have a meaningful impact on the story, culminating in a couple different endings (plus a secret one that can only be achieved during New Game+). Most of those endings are at least worth seeing once, however accessing them requires mastering a rigid and unintuitive karma system that measures your Moral, Wrathful, and Harmony scores based on dialogue options you choose along the way. Gaining access to some of the endings and getting characters to like you will require learning which kinds of responses one character likes versus another, which means lots of times I wasn’t roleplaying as a character so much as I was giving a response that I thought a certain person would like me for – or, worse yet, just doing it so I could get a high enough score in one category to unlock a certain ending, which took me out of the experience by forcing me to metagame more often than I would have liked. Digivolve Into Chaos In between long stretches of visual novel gameplay, you’ll slog your way through Digimon Survive’s absolutely abhorrent tactics combat. These turn-based battles will be familiar if you’ve ever played something like a Fire Emblem game, only this particular iteration of the genre is unbearable in just about every conceivable way. It’s one of the most barebones designs I’ve ever seen from a tactics game: each Digimon only has two moves (a standard attack and a signature move), enemies are samey and predictable, and the battle system doesn’t evolve at all as you progress. In fact, there are so few factors to consider that practically no tactics or strategy were ever required of me beyond choosing my strongest Digimon and rushing my opponent, even on harder difficulties. The result is a repetitive and painfully dull combat system that I found to be deeply offensive, and I couldn’t stand more than a minute of it at a time before sighing deeply and resigning myself to its cold, upsetting embrace. Which is unfortunate, because the genuinely worthwhile story is interrupted with these prolonged and crude encounters that often drag on for way too long. If you’re hoping to add your favorite Digimon to your roster or are playing on the Normal or Hard difficulties like I jumped between, a certain amount of grinding will be required too, and that means you’ll need to subject yourself to this rudimentary and boring combat system on a regular basis. Digimon Survive also uses a recruitment system that’s similar to Persona 5, where you convince Digimon to join your team by answering seemingly pointless questions with equally meaningless responses to find the answers each Digimon likes. If you correctly answer questions to a Digimon’s satisfaction, then you get a percentage chance that they’ll join your team – which in my case resulted in the Digimon running away about 80% of the time, causing me to have to seek them out and endure the combat system all over again. It’s seriously one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve had in recent memory and put an extremely sour taste in my mouth during an adventure I would have enjoyed a great deal more if it wasn’t included at all. In fairness, the developers did include plenty of options to make the painful combat less prickly by letting you increase battle speed, turn off animations, and even use an auto-battle option so you can just passively watch your Digimon duke it out. There’s even a “retry” option if you’re trying to catch a Digimon and fail due to RNG not going in your favor. Of course, with so many tools that enable you to speed up, skip through, or not engage with the combat system, it’s pretty sad that so much effort has been put into allowing you to avoid playing half of the game at all costs. I would have much preferred if that effort would have been put into fleshing it out and making combat actually fun to play. Do you automate combat when given the option? No, I always play fights myself Only to skip super easy fights Only if the combat isn't fun Yes, I rarely play fights myself Answer See Results There aren’t many compliments I can offer Digimon Survive’s combat, but one is that it satisfyingly rewards players who invest time in developing social links with the story’s characters. That’s because your affinity with a character determines the extent to which they’re able to Digivolve, meaning those you’re closest with will be the most powerful allies on the battlefield. If you’re like me and were hoping to spend as little time in that mess of a game mode, then this gives a huge incentive to spend time with your friends and make sure they’re happy.",

        "Subtitle": "Black Ops 4 multiplayer has a great arsenal and versatile Specialists, but is held back by bugs and issues with launch maps.",
        "Subheader": "By Miranda Sanchez Updated: Apr 21, 2020 2:44 am Posted: Oct 18, 2018 11:00 pm",
        "Content": "  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Zombies Review  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Blackout Review  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review  Developer Treyarch touted that, for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, multiplayer as a strategic experience where teammates could work together to gain the advantage in the Fog of War and outplay their enemies. I say leave that to the paid professional players and to the hardcore teams. For the rest of us, Black Ops 4 multiplayer isn’t so much of a “strategic first-person shooter” as it is a first-person shooter that encourages creativity in playstyles but doesn’t demand it. It also sets a whole new tempo for Black Ops, one that successfully moves away from thrust-jumps and wall running to a slightly toned-down speed that makes for a more fitting pace. Black Ops 4’s multiplayer certainly has its issues, including a disappointing new mode Control, and some lacking map designs. But with all of its Specialist changes and its new Heist mode, Black Ops 4 makes for a good entry in Call of Duty’s long multiplayer history, though unexciting launch maps may leave it in the shadows of its exciting battle royale sibling, Blackout. That Bunny Has a Gun Black Ops 4’s arsenal plays exactly as I expected it to as a longtime Call of Duty player: it rewards players with quick reaction times and those who are skilled enough to get headshots. Black Ops 4 maintains Black Ops 3’s status quo of doing away with drop shots while maintaining the goofy, bunny-hopping effectiveness of the jump shot. With thrust-jumping gone, the jump shots aren’t as extreme with their height, but they are certainly still potent and can be annoying if you’re not prepared for that level of erratic movement. Once you get used to it, though, shooting those players out of the air makes for a satisfying kill. SMGs and automatic assault rifles seem to be the unsurprising go-to weapons in Black Ops 4, as automatic weapons with a high rate of fire tend to be popular in Call of Duty. Many of the 14 maps feature tighter corridors that give those rapid-fire automatic weapons the edge, but I’ve been able to make use of four of the five weapon classes rather easily. The fifth, sniper rifles, aren’t my forte, but I’ve seen plenty of other skilled players use them for impressive kills. It’s great that Black Ops 4’s full arsenal is viable instead of just one or two weapon classes that everyone has to adhere to. The good news is no one weapon in my 100+ games seemed overpowered, and some of the best weapons are available right when you jump in. Stock classes include some weapons that are only unlocked at high levels, like the four-round burst Swordfish that’s unlocked at level 55. Every now and then I’d forgo using one of my custom classes and swap to that preset Swordfish class when I played maps like Firing Range. This meant I didn’t gain any weapon levels and I had no control over the class’s perks or equipment, but all that mattered to me was that I had the option to use the excellent Swordfish rifle to do better in the match, even if it meant sacrificing some weapon progression. Every IGN Call of Duty Review 53 Images Active healing is, by far, the most universal strategic element in Black Ops 4, and it’s a welcome one. “ The massive change to the series standard automatic health regeneration system really makes Black Ops 4 multiplayer interesting. Unlike in previous games, players have to actively choose to heal themselves and press a button to do so. The healing syringe takes a short time to charge, and there’s an equipment called the Stim Shot that makes that charge time even shorter. Having this option has noticeably changed one-on-one encounters, requiring each player to figure out just what the other is doing beyond their movements. Are they healing? Should you heal? Should you jump in? The addition of active healing is, by far, the most universal strategic element in Black Ops 4, and it’s a welcome one. Helpful Side Effects When I hopped into multiplayer with a friend, our first instinct wasn’t to pick Specialists that work well together – we instead chose Specialists that we enjoyed playing. Unlike hero shooters where team composition is incredibly important because of the character kit design, Black Ops 4’s Specialists are more like an extension of your loadout, not the definition of it. This flexible design is great and provides lone wolves like me the freedom to choose the Specialist that gives the biggest advantage on the map or mode. That’s not to say that Specialists can’t be used by players who want to compose a team strategy. Some Specialists kits work together beautifully. I love that these multiplayer characters were designed with all kinds of players in mind. Black Ops 4’s Specialists are more like an extension of your loadout, not the definition of it. “ There’s value to each of the Specialists’ special equipment, but playing certain Specialists almost guarantee a tactical advantage for your team. Vision is an important factor in any sort of tactical multiplayer game, and that feels even more true with Black Ops 4’s added Fog of War that greatly limits minimap vision. Gaining a vision advantage is huge on any mode or map, which makes Specialist Recon incredibly valuable. His sensor dart grants a small circle of vision. It’s a great piece of equipment, but it’s easily destroyed and doesn’t last too long, two qualities that work in tandem to keep it balanced. As far as synergy goes, pairing Recon’s equipment with Torque's razor wire or barricade make for an effective defense of an area. Specialist equipment like Torque’s is generally more useful in objective-based modes like Domination and Hardpoint. The key to Specialists is knowing which situations to use them in, just like with your loadout. For instance, Nomad’s K9-Unit (it’s a little strange that a “unit” is only one dog, but it’s cute and its name is Juno) isn't all that useful in long, open maps where enemies can take it out before it reaches them, but it simply destroys enemies in enclosed areas. Then there’s Specialists like Ajax, whose 9-Bang concussion grenade is available too frequently for how incredibly potent it is at disorienting enemies, who can be effective in just about any situation. Excluding Ajax’s 9-Bang, I’ve found that the Specialists generally feel well balanced.  I appreciate that each Specialist also demands varying levels of commitment from the player. For instance, if you don’t care about learning how to best utilize the Specialist equipment, you can play someone like Crash who is honestly the best for checking out and focusing on shooting. His equipment is a simple assault pack that gives ammo and awards bonus points for kills, and his TAK-5 boost all living teammates’ health to 200. Using his equipment is hard to mess up, which is great for people who want to contribute to their team and earn points but aren’t confident with some of the more skill-based Specialists. Sure, there are times when the TAK-5 could be used to get a greater advantage, but ultimately you’re not doing any major disservice to your team unless you use it when teammates are dead. For the most part, there’s only a minimal cost to misusing Specialist equipment and weapons. There are ways to use enemy equipment to your advantage, too. The Engineer Perk allows players to see enemy equipment and Scorestreaks, even through walls. If the opposing team has a Seraph, seeing her Tac-Deploy equipment allows you to predict where some number of enemies will be spawning next. Often, instead of destroying an enemy Tac-Deploy, I hung around and picked off the players that used it. To be fair, there is a warning on the Tac-Deploy that says when there are enemies in the area, so they do have a fighting chance when they choose to use the Tac-Deploy. Seeing enemy fortifications can also help inform which points to target in Domination and Control.  Uneven Playgrounds While the new battle royale mode, Blackout, probably stands as the most exciting multiplayer addition to Black Ops 4, the traditional multiplayer side does have a fun new mode itself. Heist – a mode similar to Battlefield Hardline’s Heist or what you’d see in Payday – serves as a palate cleanser between classic modes. In Heist, teams need to grab a bag of money that’s usually set in a tempting, open area and get it to an extraction site. A team wins the round by successfully delivering the cash or eliminating the enemy team. At the end of each round, every player uses their hard-earned cash to buy weapons, perks, attachments, armor, and more. Heist seems to have a similar issue to Search and Destroy, where players go for kills over grabbing the cash, but it’s an enjoyable mode nonetheless that let me experiment with loadouts I’d otherwise never use. I usually don’t equip pistols, but since you start with one in Heist, I learned to appreciate them a little more. Heist also has all high-level weapons available for purchase, which is a nice touch that let me experiment with guns I had yet to unlock in an exciting environment. I was mostly disappointed with Control, the other multiplayer mode introduced in Black Ops 4. In Control, one team defends two points and the other team is tasked with capturing them in a rather short amount of time. So long as no attackers are on a point, the clock ticks down. The capture mode can offer intense matches on mid-sized maps like Jungle and Seaside, but Control also brought me the closest I’ve ever been to rage quitting. While smaller maps like Slums seem like the best fit for Control, it’s rather easy to get pinned down in your spawn area if you’re up against a hyper-aggressive bunch. Since teams are assigned to one side of the map as either the attacker or defender, the opposing team is able to position themselves in areas to effectively spawn camp. Their advantage over a spawn and the match snowballs from there. Even when I managed to break out of the spawn area, I was bitter that so many lives were wasted in the process. This happened even on a big map, like Militia. The spawn camping issue doesn’t only take place in Control, though. While I generally like the new maps, many of the main spawn points are surrounded by open terrain with higher ground not too far off in the distance, making it easy for the opposing team to pick off newly spawned enemies over and over again. I experienced this on Morocco, Icebreaker, and others. While this mainly happened in modes featured in the Capture Moshpit, the fact that my teams were pinned like this multiple times in Black Ops 4’s first week is very discouraging. Black Ops 4 sees the return of old Black Ops maps, like the great Firing Range map along with Summit. I wish Treyarch swapped Slums with another classic, though – its encounter points are too predictable, much like the disappointing Icebreaker and the mildly better but still lacking Morocco. A common issue I’ve found with Black Ops 4’s new, narrow, three-lane maps is that many of them feel stale after playing them a few times. Firefights happen in the same few places, and the spawn points are limited on each side of the maps, which further encourages select favored combat areas. Even though Firing Range is on the small side, its lack of a standard three-lane design makes it far more fun to hunt down enemies. And even though people flock to specific points, as engagements still take place just about anywhere as the match goes on, rather than just one central location. Black Ops 4’s polished mechanics deserve a great playground. “ Black Ops 4’s map selection does have some good new offerings. Militia is a standout with its slightly less obvious lanes and a more open design that gives the advantage to LMGs, Snipers, and Tactical Rifles. Then there are maps like Gridlock and Payload that offer a fun challenge for modes like Domination where their open courtyards and big rooms that have multiple entrances make for great battlegrounds. Contraband is rather neat too with its underwater paths that allow players to cross its lanes. I’m glad that there are a few new maps that are genuinely fun to play, because Black Ops 4’s polished mechanics deserve a great playground. It’s just a shame that there are a few maps in the mix that I can’t permanently opt out of. Aspiring to Something Greater Win or lose, the multiplayer progression system always gave me a pat on the back to encourage me to keep playing. New weapons, attachment unlocks, camos, and other rewards are frequent, and the impressive number of challenges ensure that I’m always working toward some sort of XP bonus and neat calling card. Operator Mods are a great incentive to keep playing and to master weapons, too. These new attachments unlock after you’ve reached certain weapons’ max level and make them more powerful in some unique way. To keep things balanced, Operator Mods require three of your 10 item slots in your custom class. I unlocked the Titan’s Operator Mod, the Oppressor, which slightly increased the LMG’s damage and can “suppress enemies near your bullet stream.” Realistically, this means that it provides some very mild distortion to enemies you’re firing at, and it’s been useful enough. Other Operator Mods are a little more obvious with their buffs, like how the VAPR-XKG’s Operator Mod adds a bayonet or the Auger DMR’s turns it from a single fire rifle into a 2-round burst. The seemingly endless customization options have kept me excited to try new things “ Beyond Operator Mods, there's good potential for customization and experimenting with new loadouts in the late levels beyond unlocking some great new weapons. Classic tactical gear – like the frag grenade – is available after level 40, and I could see myself swapping out Firebreak’s special equipment – the difficult to use reactor core – for a Molotov or concussion grenade. The seemingly endless customization options have kept me excited to try new things as I work toward prestiging. Bugs and Features Black Ops 4 includes a few more features, both good and bad, worth mentioning. Splitscreen co-op is in Black Ops 4 multiplayer, but it comes at the sacrifice of frame rate and resolution. While I'm grateful it's still a feature when it has been slowly phased out of other games, making that heavy graphics sacrifice is something for Treyarch to remedy in the next Call of Duty. Theater mode is back, too, and remains a great tool to bookmark your best games and clip out awesome kills – or to learn from other players who accomplished cool things. It can be a little buggy, though: It crashed my game once, and sometimes the controls to swap between player perspectives stopped working when I brought up the scoreboard. This wasn’t the only bug I experienced in Black Ops 4 multiplayer. At one point, another player’s EKIA popped up in place of mine in an overlay, and my red dot sight randomly disappeared while I was in a match. I’ve also seen player tags disappear and strange graphical bugs appear on fallen players. Overall, the bugs are infrequent and, aside from the red dot issue, mostly inconsequential. Another new feature related to multiplayer but not directly in the multiplayer suite is the Specialist HQ. These solo character missions effectively act as a tutorial for Black Ops 4’s multiplayer and an introduction to the Specialists as characters. It’s a helpful tool for learning how to use Specialists like Firebreak who have more situational equipment and provides a good (and graphic) story for the multiplayer characters. The mission narrator, an original Black Ops character called Frank Woods, is actually rather poetic too in these tutorial missions in spite of his vulgarity. Specialist missions aren’t a replacement for those wanting a complete campaign, but I’m glad they’re a feature in Black Ops 4.",

        "Subtitle": "If only my dog had super powers...",
        "Subheader": "By Ryan Clements Updated: May 11, 2012 10:59 am Posted: Nov 24, 2008 7:00 pm",
        "Content": "I knew I was in for a \"great\" experience when, upon examining the back of the Bolt PS3 box, I saw a picture of the character Penny enthusiastically riding her red scooter next to a small disclaimer that read \"scooter not in game.\" Awesome. That's never a good start.  If you haven't been keeping up to date on your computer-animated flicks, Bolt is the newest film from Walt Disney Pictures that follows the diminutive dog Bolt who stars in a hit TV series where his character has incredible super powers. Unfortunately, this leads the canine star to believe that he does in fact possess said powers and hijinks ensue when he attempts to make it back to his owner Penny after a mishap sends him across the country and away from the TV studio.  In keeping with the Licensed Game Tradition, any big movie must go hand-in-hand with a multiplatform videogame release and Bolt is certainly no exception. Developed by Avalanche Software, Bolt is actually not the worst licensed game I've played but that's not exactly a glowing compliment. While there are some good ideas and noble attempts, the game falls short of properly entertaining the player.   Laser vision for the win.  One of the smartest design decisions made by Avalanche was capitalizing on the movie's \"canon\" in order to create a unique game world. Instead of having the game follow the plotline of its silver screen counterpart, the Bolt videogame takes place entirely in the universe of the aforementioned TV series. That way, the game can do its own thing but still inhabit the Bolt world.  Bolt is made up of two different game types: the main story and the shooter mini-game (which I'll touch on shortly). In the story mode, you'll control either Penny, who follows platforming and stealth conventions, or Bolt, who carries out the majority of the game's combat. Neither of the characters are fun by any stretch of the imagination, but playing as Bolt is a flat out chore. Mild third-person platforming is overwhelmed by annoying, repetitive combat that I just can't see the fun in.  Bolt has a variety of super powers at his disposal like a Sonic Bark and Laser Vision, but because these powers eat away at his energy gauge, you'll also need to rely on normal attacks. These attacks are where the game gets extremely tedious, because you're basically just mashing away at a few buttons while Bolt bounces off enemies like a slingshot. The real problem comes from just how many of Calico's minions (Calico being the main antagonist) you have to face in a single confrontation and the ridiculous amount of damage they can take. By the end of the game I was so incredibly sick of combat that I lamented every moment I had to play as Super Dog.  Playing as Penny is only marginally better. Her sections of the game focus on platforming and using stealth to get around enemies, which I consider to be a decided improvement over the ridiculous combat system. Penny's platforming abilities hinge on the usage of her Wheelbar, which is a small device that she carries with her throughout the game. The Wheelbar is an extendable pole with a wheel on each end, which Penny can attach to ledges and shoulder-wide enclosures and traverse them quickly and quietly. The Wheelbar is easily the best element of the game as a whole, but unfortunately you can't get especially creative with its usage. There are very specific and linear areas you can use it on and those areas are always terribly obvious thanks to Penny's Enhanced Vision, which you can activate with a press of a button. This paints the traversable paths bright yellow and eliminates the need for any exploration or a sense of freedom. Lame.   Ghost ride da Wheelbar.  Using stealth would have been a nice addition to the package, but it is -- surprisingly -- entirely useless . In theory, Penny can creep up behind Calico's soldiers and execute a Sneak Attack which immediately disables them. Yet there's absolutely no point in putting this to practice because it's easier and faster just to \"get caught\" and let them come to you. When they attempt to grab Penny, a very easy Quick Time Event comes up and one button press disables the soldier. If I can always win these quick mini-battles, what's the point in wasting time sneaking around an entire level? Avalanche essentially broke its own stealth mechanic by giving you a sure-fire way to take out enemies without taking the time to be sneaky.  The only relief from playing as these two characters is a mini-game inspired by modern dual-thumbstick shooters. These mini-games pop up anytime Penny hacks into a computer mainframe. You essentially guide a small probe around computer-themed levels and blast away at Counter Intrusion Programs that try to shoot you down or ram into you. The tragedy is that this mini-game controls so poorly it just isn't fun, and the only difference between each hacking instance is how the levels are laid out. There's just not enough depth in the gameplay to keep things interesting.",

        "Title": "Assassin's Creed III Wii U Review",
        "Subtitle": "As much of a Revolution as was promised?",
        "Subheader": "By Keza MacDonald Posted: Nov 21, 2012 1:39 am",
        "Content": "If there’s one image that encapsulates the Assassin’s Creed series, it’s that of a hooded figure balancing atop some skyscraping parapet, looking down into the city below. It’s a snapshot that shows off a lot of what makes these games special – their incredible attention to detail, breath-taking verticality, fascinating architecture, unique historical settings - but it also represents their limitations. Assassin’s Creed games are easy to admire, but you often feel a bit distanced from them, too, held back from inhabiting these worlds as fully as you’d like to. You’ve always been on the outside looking in. Not so with Assassin’s Creed III, which hauls the series across the ocean into a new setting that’s absolutely bursting with things to do. It turns a fascinating section of history into a vast open-world playground, letting you conquer the rooftops, stalk the forests and sail the seas of revolutionary America and authoring a main storyline that puts you in the middle of some of the most important events of the period, like a fly on the wall of history. It’s all about enjoying the freedom of movement the game affords you and immersing yourself in its world, as well as setting up the set-piece assassinations that form the climax of each chapter. Where the storyline missions usually follow a pattern of gathering information, stalking and eventually killing a high-profile target (with the odd naval mission or large-scale battle thrown in for variety), outside of that you're free to do whatever you want: hunt for trinkets, clamber over the rooftops of New York in search of almanac pages, or pick fights with the Redcoats on behalf of the populace. There is a vast amount of content in this game, from liberating Boston and New York to building up a homestead on the frontier to sailing the high seas to just enjoying the outdoors and hunting wildlife. But perhaps because Assassin's Creed III is so huge, it can be pretty inconsistent. It attempts an astonishing amount, and doesn’t always succeed. Assassin's Creed III follows hot-tempered Native American assassin Connor for almost his entire life, starting as a tree-climbing kid and growing from troubled young man to vengeful adult – but without wanting to spoil anything, he's not the only character you'll play. Connor's path often intersects with key moments in the American Revolution, putting him in the middle of the Battle of Bunker Hill for one spectacular mission. He finds himself fighting on the side of the Patriots for most of the game, but because he has enemies on both sides, his motivations for doing so has little to do with their battle for independence from the British crown. Connor isn't as straightforwardly charming as Assassin's Creed II's Ezio, and although writing is excellent for the most part, you never warm to Assassin’s Creed III’s heroes nor grow to resent its villains in quite the same way. It’s impossible to discuss exactly why this is without spoiling something of the game’s plot - which you definitely don’t want, as there are some great moments here. There will doubtless be a lot of discussion around this after the game makes its way into players’ hands, but what it really comes down to is that Connor often feels more like an errand boy than a freedom fighter; within the missions, Assassin’s Creed III can feel very scripted and dictatorial, fettering you with rigid objectives and punishing you harshly when you step outside their boundaries – chase sequences are particularly infuriating on this front. The game is often at its best outside of the story, when it leaves you to enjoy and inhabit its world. Connor isn't as straightforwardly charming as Assassin's Creed II's Ezio, and although writing is excellent for the most part, you never warm to Assassin’s Creed III’s heroes nor grow to resent its villains in quite the same way. “ As a technological achievement, Assassin’s Creed III is astounding. Its excellent opening in a London opera house is a showcase for the new and improved animation, crowd physics and freedom of movement, but as soon as you hit the New World it is all about the great outdoors. Assassin's Creed III's story spans decades and over that time you get to see the gorgeous forests and nascent cities of Connor's homeland covered in heavy snow, gleaming in autumnal morning mists, and blooming in the summer. It can be stunning. Walking the streets of bustling Boston, full of people and noise and activity, you can't help but be in awe. However, Assassin’s Creed III is often the victim of its own technological ambition. Pop-in, frame-rate drops and occasional graphical glitches are definitely a part of the experience, and you do wonder whether the omnipresent fog in New York City has more to do with technical limitations than the weather. The loading times are also hefty and I encountered some significant bugs during my review playthrough, though the developer claims that these will be fixed with a day-one patch. But it feels petty to begrudge the game for these hiccups when it pushes the boundaries of this generation so far. The basics of Assassin’s Creed – free-running and combat – have been honed to near-perfection here. Free-running has been simplified and improved, and scaling the rock faces and branches of the frontier is no more difficult or confusing than climbing the ornate architecture of European cities. The Animus interface is clearer and less intrusive then before – spiderweb-like vectors highlight things that Connor can interact with and show when he’s hidden from view in the undergrowth or in a crowd. Every element of the HUD is customisable, letting you determine exactly how much visual help you want. Assassin's Creed III is more combat-focussed than previous games in the series; there's a lot less leaping around ruined buildings and much more stalking and killing, of man and beast both. “ Combat is still a fairly simplistic parry-and-counter system, but it's made much more exciting by some excellently gruesome kill animations and a big selection of weapons – although, weirdly, you have to visit a shop or the homestead mansion to swap out your swords, axes, tomahawks or clubs. But trying to remain hidden is much more satisfying than just causing a giant brawl – staying incognito during assassination missions is extremely challenging, usually for the right reasons. Assassin's Creed III is more combat-focussed than previous games in the series; there's a lot less leaping around ruined buildings and much more stalking and killing, of man and beast both. Multiplayer is an unexpected pleasure, placing the finely honed running-and-killing mechanics of the single-player game into an inventive and surprisingly cerebral new context. The new Wolf Pack mode, a co-operative score attack where you and friends work together to kill NPC targets, is superficially entertaining, but honestly it’s the familiar Assassinate mode that still holds the most appeal, getting you to identify and kill other human players amongst a crowd of NPCs whilst trying to remain hidden yourself. Playing the multiplayer unlocks an impressively fully-formed, branching story about the Animus and Abstergo that provides extra motivation to keep playing, but it’s the thrilling mixture of deception, quick-wittedness and sudden violence at the heart of most of the game modes that keeps it exciting. There’s a lot to it, so much so that it almost feels like an entirely separate game from the single-player. Assassin’s Creed III’s pacing is a source of frustration for the first third or so of the story – it takes too long to open up and show its hand. Right at the beginning of Connor's story you're kept on a short leash; your movements are wholly dictated by the plot for a good three hours or so, which is disappointing when you've had a taste of how open the world can be. It's a definite low point that lasts too long, and the game only really recovers when it sets you free again to explore at your own pace. After that point, the minimap bristles with enticing icons, inviting you to join hunting clubs, explore with frontiersmen, recruit your own assassin underlings in New York and Boston by loosening the Templars’ grip on the cities, or take part in hours’ worth of optional naval missions that put you behind a ship’s wheel. How much you engage with all of this optional fun will determine how much you enjoy Assassin’s Creed 3 as a whole; stick to the story missions and you’ll quickly become frustrated with their strictures (and frequent cut-scenes), but allow yourself an hour or two of exploration between each of them and the game’s rhythm is much better. The naval missions, particularly, are a real highlight: they’re dramatic and novel, and the feeling of steering the ship against the ocean’s swell and battling through unfavourable winds is really convincing. But although Assassin’s Creed III’s variety and freedom is in many respects a saving grace, it’s also problematic: there’s a vast amount to do, but not all of it is integrated well. Where some optional stuff like the naval adventures, fort assaults and the Homestead side-story missions are great, other things feel unfinished, tacked-on or queerly pointless, like the Boston and New York underground tunnels, trading and crafting, and training your assassins once you’ve recruited them. These features aren’t fully realised and feel like wasted ideas. How much you enjoy the game will depend heavily on how willing you are to figure out and engage with these optional activities on your own, because the game won’t guide you towards them.  Playing Assassin's Creed III on Wii U's Game Pad is a tad disappointing -- it looks a bit low-res compared to other console ports. If you use the Game Pad as a support device, the helpful mini-map gives you a solid look at a large local space, identifying enemy, poster, and objective locations in your hands. Pressing the touch-screen to whistle for your horse means keeping two weapons in Connor's weapon slots, so that's a worthwhile convenience. Beyond that, Assassin's Creed III for Wii U is functionally identical to the original.",

        "Content": "Last year Ubisoft released My French Coach and My Spanish Coach for the Nintendo DS, successfully cashing in on the growing demand for language games that allow people to quickly pick up on the basics. This year they've once again teamed up with developer Sensory Sweep in order to capitalize on the need for Mandarin speakers outside of China. Although making Chinese accessible to everyone is certainly a step in the right direction, My Chinese Coach sometimes proves to be a tangled web of frustration and confusion rather than an enjoyable learning experience.  There are plenty of reasons to want to make a game like this. China is home to a fifth of the globe's total population and is quickly becoming an important economic and political player on the world stage. It's only natural game developers would want to cash in on this. But Chinese isn't something Westerners can just \"pick up\" like French or Spanish. For one thing, Chinese has very little in common with the European language family. Not only is the writing system vastly different (consisting of pictographs as opposed to an alphabet), but the language itself is both analytic and tonal, with four basic tones and one toneless tone. Trying to teach all of this outside a proper classroom setting would be a formidable task for anyone, but Sensory Sweep seems to struggle with this new, complicated dynamic.  Like the other My Language titles, My Chinese Coach consists of a series of games designed to teach players the language in various ways. Activities like \"Hit-a-Word\", \"Multiple Choice\" and \"Memory\" quickly help players visually recognize written characters, which is helpful for reading skills.  But the writing portion of My Chinese Coach is a major problem. The tutorials that show you how to write a character in Chinese are ridiculously fast. Unless players already have a basic grasp of how to write in Chinese (and it's safe to assume they don't) it's virtually impossible to understand both the stroke count and line order for a character. It doesn't help that the game will judge your writing skills arbitrarily at times, making games like \"Fading Characters\" uber-frustrating.    On top of that My Chinese Coach has a hard time teaching the proper pronunciation of words, due mostly to the muffled audio on the DS system. It's often a struggle to hear the speaker, even with the volume turned up. And since Mandarin has quite a few sounds that have no exact English equivalent, players may become exasperated when they play back their own voice in the \"Speak\" option of the game and realize it sounds nothing like what they just heard.",

        "Content": ", sequel to the PS1 game Galerians , takes place almost right after the events found in the first game. The story is a poor mishmash of sci-fi  clichés that draws much of its inspiration from the likes of such seminal works as Akira and The Matrix . You've got your self-aware computer that revolts against mankind; you've got humanoids with psychic abilities; and who could forget the inner struggle of discovering where true reality lies. For those not in the know, the first Galerians had you in the role of Rion, a young man out to stop the sentient computer known as Dorothy from destroying the human race. In the end you were victorious, but now, six years later, Dorothy is back and so are you. If this makes little sense to you, don't worry: the game summarizes the events of the previous game in a somewhat lengthy intro movie. As a game, Galerians: Ash had a lot of potential. Even with its hackneyed storyline, the thought of using psychic powers in all-out Akira -like battles is still irresistible. It's just too bad that Ash couldn't deliver on this concept in any way or form. Gameplay There are several glaring design issues in Galerians: Ash that keep it from being an enjoyable gaming experience in any sort of way. Let's start with the combat system. Rather than having a weapon at your disposal, your character has three psychic abilities that he can use to battle enemies and bosses: Nalcon, Red, and D-Felon. To use any one of these powers you must first charge it up, which takes roughly a second or two. Herein lies the problem. While charging up your attack, you can neither move nor use your shield, and are completely susceptible to attack. Most of the time you will take damage before you fully charge your blast and must start your charge all over again...only to get hit again...only to have to charge again... Catch my drift? This combat system makes no logical sense. You can lock onto enemies and strafe around them while not attacking, but God forbid you be allowed to dodge attacks while trying to attack yourself. And using your shield isn't any better since that also makes you immobile, and you can't charge an attack while using it. The shield is also worthless when fighting a bevy of enemies because it only shields your front side, leaving your sides and back open for devouring. Now imagine facing three enemies that move just as quickly as you do while trying to block their attacks with your shield, all the while attempting to find a free moment to charge your attack. And remember: you can't move while on the offense or defense. Whatever.  Another overt gameplay problem is the mixture of puzzles with battle. For example, one of the first puzzles you'll come across has a flame in the center of the room. When you run through it, it disappears and re-appears in a different location. The goal is to keep running through the flame until the door opens. If you wait too long before running through the next flame, it will disappear and you must start over. Not really a difficult puzzle to figure out on its own, picture a group of enemies chasing you while trying to complete the task. Attacking or defending will force you to stop moving thereby wasting the limited amount of time you have to make it to the next flame. My first thought was to kill all the enemies first, then proceed with the puzzle, but the enemies re-spawn after you kill them. So, your only real choice is to run away and avoid battle completely while trying to complete the puzzle. Sound design? I think not. As is the case in most 3D games, camera issues also creep their way into the game. The game is played from a third-person behind-the-back perspective and the only control you have over the camera is its height. All three of these camera angles are so similar I wonder why the option was even included. Most of the time the default camera is usable, but there are just too many occasions where its spin causes confusion, especially when locked onto enemies. There is also a first-person mode that you can use, but not only is this a worthless feature, its implementation feels sloppy. Let me explain: there are rarely times when you need to switch to a first person mode for any reason. Only in the occasional boss fight does this come in handy, and even then it's a minor accommodation. Then there's the sloppy implementation. To use the first-person view you just press the right analog stick in the direction you want to look. This causes the camera to jerk so suddenly into a first-person perspective that you almost have to reorient yourself before examining the area. Full control of the camera, as well as a simple \"hold the trigger\" system for first-person viewing would have been a much, much better solution. But Galerians: Ash 's worst problem is not the clunky battle system, or its faulty puzzle design, or its unmanageable camera; it's the boring gameplay. More often than not, you'll be traversing large, capacious rooms and hallways that are lifeless and non-interactive without any real clue as to what you're supposed to be doing. Only by searching every room and going through every floor will you eventually find what you're looking for, and that's by accident . Then, after you find an item of interest, you'll have to search the same five floors of rooms again in hopes of accidentally running into another item or person that may trigger a cutscene or give you a clue as to your next objective. And the whole time this is going on, there's nothing to keep your interest visually, mentally, or sonically; boring indeed.  Graphics Galerians: Ash has a lot going for it visually, but equally as much going against it. First, the good: as advertised on the back of the box, there are \"real time battles in 60FPS.\"  Actually, the whole game runs at a rock-solid sixty frames per second, even during boss battles that have more particles polluting the air than in downtown Los Angeles. Some of the environments are also intimidating in their vast openness and Gigerian art direction, not too mention being fancifully adorned with sharp, detailed textures. Overall, a good, solid graphics engine powers the visuals behind Galerians: Ash . But where the visuals falter is in their art direction (I know, a contradiction from above, but let me explain) and animation. While some of the environments do look great (see above), most of them are of the metal hallway variety: generic looking rooms and corridors that have little in the way of visual landmarks and/or decorative style. Too bad. Also, the character models and animation leave a lot to be desired. Take the main character for example. His rockstar-skinny body and bowed arms that waddle while he runs make him a little hard to take seriously as a psychic badass, if you know what I mean. Many of the other characters suffer some similar design issues too, as well as overly simplified models that look almost a generation too old. A caption on the back of the box says, \"Featuring over 60 minutes of High Quality cutscenes,\" and this is no lie. The cutscenes found in the game are generally very sharp, but some of them seem to be in-game cutscenes that have been compressed and thrown in as video. The video artifacts and drop in quality make these scenes stick out like opposable thumbs on a feline. The lip syncing is also off a majority of the time in both the in-game and CG cutscenes, and radiates a feeling of cheapness from the game.   Sound Many of the game's cinemas are fully voiced, and the result will leave you begging for a little more supper on your plate. Definitely not the worse you'll ever hear, the voice acting is missing the one crucial element that makes voices the storytellers they are: real human emotion (but maybe that's fitting considering Rion is in fact not real). The lines are delivered with an emptiness and contrivance that make Steven Wright seem more like Robin Williams in comparison. The fact that many of the lines are so poorly translated and/or written doesn't help. Take the battle with Parano for example. After defeating him he says, \"Next time definitely I'm going to screw up your brains for sure.\" Um, sure, you go ahead and do that...definitely...for sure...yeah. Not taking the voice acting into consideration, the game music is pretty sparse, but what's there is decent. A lot of ambient bass and metallic sounds fill the air, with your occasional electronic music filling in the blanks. Strictly average stuff.",

        "Content": "That's the quote on the back of the Napoleon Dynamite game and the instruction booklet, both of which aren't the actual quote from the movie. Even if you excuse the fact that this is a game based on a movie that has long since burned through its share of social relevancy or catchphrases, there's still the fact that it's a mini-game collection.  That's not to say that there can't be good games made up of nothing but mini-games, but 7 Studios managed to not only assemble a mostly forgettable group of almost 30 bite-sized offerings, but it force fed painful wanna-be Napoleon-isms into the game. The result is a licensed title that completely misses the charm and quirkiness of the movie's well-intentioned vibe and instead defaults to regurgitating catchphrases that have long since died.   Yes you are. The \"story\" in the game is delivered through a series of either text boxes with disembodied heads or jointed sprites with flip-flop arms and legs that converse dryly with each other. Rarely do they actually follow the script of the movie (and when they do, it's usually horribly out of context), but the game only loosely follows the movie anyway.  And so, after Tina, Napoleon's pet llama, escapes out into the wild, the off-kilter lead heads into town, all the while participating in \"wacky\" and \"outrageous\" mini-games. These games are broken down into chunks corresponding at least in a basic way to stuff that happens in the movie: you'll tow Kip on a bike (though not into town like the movie, but instead out of town), and participate in Rex Kwon Do (sadly, you'll get no disembodied Diedrich Bader head here). There's also whack a piñata. In the game's defense, it does incorporate quite a few moments from the movie, like a dance-off rhythm action game or the ability to defend Nessie when Japanese scientists try to blow her up. However, especially in the case of the former, it's recycled so many times that by the end you don't really care too much about winning a multi-stage dance competition.  Other concepts, like a side-scrolling shooter, are just given a face-lift and repurposed. Yeah, sure, in one you're driving a lowrider, in another you're flying on Pegasus and in another you're feeding Tina, but you're still lazily shooting at stuff. Ditto for the parts where you ride a bike and hit jumps/tow Kip/use a horse to launch over a lake. Throw in a couple of instances of using a bow and arrow or throwing a football with the same basic strength and angle gauges (the football game in particular is eerily similar to the whack-a-penguin or whack-a-student Flash games that were popular a while back), and the supposed collection of 30 or so games shrinks quite a bit.   Move busting. Admittedly, there are a few of the mini-games that are tolerable. The Pipe Dream-like computer hacking game is decent. Assembling the time machine requires that Tetris-like shapes have to be crammed perfectly onto a gridded set of connectors, and even if it is a bit of a biter, the football game offers some nice variety thanks to the objects you can hit or pressing the X Button at the right time to keep the ball bouncing.  I realize I'm harping awfully hard about a value-priced game, and one that at least tries to embrace its inherent budget status. After all, it has visuals that look like paper cutouts all taped, paper clipped or thumb tacked together. Unfortunately, the lack of things like voice talent from the cast (there are sound clips used, but the few that are there are recycled constantly) and an overwhelming feeling that the game just missed the mark -- both in timing and in approach -- permeates the whole experience. Little things like staring at a loading screen for a few seconds just to see someone say, \"great job\" and, \"thanks\" just exacerbate things.",

So I have no sympathy when companies release overpriced XBLA titles that offer far too little for the average consumer. And that's why I am here to tell you to save your money and do not buy 3 on 3 NHL Arcade .  For 800 MSP ($10), you are given what should be a bonus mode in NHL 2010. It's 3v3 hockey (plus goalies) with arcade-style rules. That's fine. In fact, that could be great. But there's no added value. Who's your favorite NHL team? Is it red or is it blue? There are no NHL arenas, no licensed NHL teams or jerseys. Just red or blue. We're not the Red League or the Blue League, we're the National Hockey League. Except in NHL Arcade, a game with no real pre- or post-game presentation, no season or tournament mode, and no stats for the 40 NHL All-Stars included.  Players are given one of three ratings--fast, strong or all-around. This keeps things very simple, which is perfectly fine for an arcade hockey title, but it does make the players you choose somewhat irrelevant. One \"strong\" player is the same as the next, minus the name on the jersey. But at least 3 on 3 makes use of player likenesses so that fans can create a small team of their favorites.  The play on ice is decent, but not nearly enough to make up for the lackluster feature set. There are two sets of control options. There is a casual-friendly button mode, which allows for simple actions without much depth. This scheme is actually not that great, as the lack of control of your stick hinders your ability to score on some tough netminders. Far better is the to skill stick control, which is basically identical to the controls of NHL 09. It's actually really cool to have full deke moves and stick handling in an arcade set-up. The AI is focused on checking you out of the ring, but the goalies can be really sharp on protecting the net. So having that added level of control allows you to create better scoring opportunities.    Despite the ability to have sim-hockey controls, 3 on 3 NHL Arcade is over-the-top. Hard checks send players flying across the ice, the character models are almost cartoonish in appearance and there are plenty of power-ups to be snagged. NHL Arcade doesn't take itself seriously. It has a laid- back announcer offering humorous quips and some random dude at EA providing the majority of sound effects a capella.  Playing solo, NHL Arcade is a total bust. There are so few bells and whistles that after one or two games you'll likely have had enough. With friends on a single console or online, things are a tad more fun. This is certainly meant as a pick-up-and-play party game. It's still not very good with others, but it is at least worth playing (if not worth owning). ",

After getting sucked into their new game console (literally), the guys need to fight for their lives to escape back home. What comes next is 16 levels of some of the most maddening 2D platforming I have ever played. Seriously, this game is frustratingly difficult. I died over 50 times on just the last boss alone. It’s nuts!  8-Bit Land starts off as simple 2D platforming fun, with players switching between both Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai can double jump and Rigby gets to crawl through tight spaces, and both are needed to fully explore each area. Levels themselves are all fairly large, so there’s a decent amount of exploration involved. Three gold VHS tapes are hidden about in each stage, giving me an incentive to poke around, and follow every path I found. There’s a timer too, and finishing levels in a speedy manner nets you bonuses, but I found trying to move quickly to be a terrible strategy, as you die from a single hit from an enemy unless you have an upgrade. It was much safer to play slowly and methodically, making the timer mostly pointless. 8-Bit Land’s major distinctive feature is that there are actually two additional games tucked in along with the 2D platformer - a side-scrolling shooter and a top-down shooter. Each of these modes have their own dedicated zones that indicate when gameplay will switch styles. The concept is really neat, and leads to some interesting puzzles where deftly switching from one to the other can earn you upgrades while advancing you through the level. But as I mentioned earlier, this game is incredibly difficult. It should say a lot that I could never quite figure out if 8-Bit Land was simply hard or if it was cheap. Half the times I died, I smacked my forehead for making a dumb mistake, and the other half of the time I was left wondering how I actually died. There were multiple instances where I was killed by an off-screen enemy, or narrowly missed a jump that totally looked like I’d made it, leaving a sour taste in my mouth. There’s a difference between a good challenge, and difficulty for difficulty’s sake; Regular Show feels more towards the latter than the former. Regular Show fans will find plenty to like here. The bosses are some of the more hilarious encounters Mordecai and Rigby have had, with the guys going toe to toe against the Flock of Geese or the Destroyer of Worlds. The story, while extremely minimal, also fits right along with the series, especially since it was written by series creator J. G. Quintel. I would have liked to see more of a narrative, but the one here works well enough. With a game this punishing though, how many fans will want to stick around to make it through? ",

        "Content": "It's comforting to know that Digital Leisure's Professor Lexis character isn't dead, especially since his first appearance on DSiWare featured him trying to commit suicide by roping himself up after unsuccessful rounds of Hangman. It's comforting, too, that that kind of heinous behavior seems to be behind him -- now, he's content to simply flip some cards for you.   Match Up ! is a two-sided memory-matching game hosted by the good professor. Its first mode, Memory Match, is just the common pre-school game of memory -- you're given a small set of cards, each of them has a symbol like a square, circle or triangle on it, and you flip them over two at a time trying to match them all up. It starts simply, with the early levels using only a handful of cards -- so it's not hard to remember where each shape is hiding on the screen. Later levels, though, add more cards, more shapes and more colors, while arranging them all in different patterns on the screen. It becomes a fair enough challenge, though nothing particularly unique.  The game's second mode, Match Machine, is a bit more interesting. It's kind of a mash-up of memory matching and a casual puzzler like Bejeweled -- in it, you're given a screen full of cards from top to bottom and tasked to make matches, as before. When you clear away matching pairs, though, they're replaced in the playing field by new cards that tumble in from the top. That can also cause a shift in position of the cards that were already in play, further challenging your memory to keep up with both were a particular shape was, and where it now is.  It's a decent idea, but some needless complications then appear to make it more frustrating than it should have been -- like Bomb Cards. Bomb Cards show up with a 10-turn countdown clock on them, giving you only that many chances to match them with another card in play. If you succeed, your score gets a big boost and surrounding cards' hidden shapes are briefly revealed. If you fail, though, it's an instant Game Over.  That's too harsh a consequence, I think, as it forces you to focus entirely on the Bombs when they appear -- and, often, multiple Bombs will be in play at once. If you miss matching even one of them, you're done. And when that's happening as early as Level 2, it's a definite game balance issue that could have been addressed better.",

        "Content": "The Force Awakens must be magic. First it reinvigorated Star Wars after a string of duds, and now it’s given the slumping LEGO games the same shot in the arm. LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the most creative, well-paced, and fun LEGO game in years. Developer Traveler's Tales always displays a keen love and affection for its source material, but with this take on the most recent Star Wars movie, it tells an entertaining story that pays wonderful tribute to Episode VII through a slew of smart puzzles and unique characters.  Unlike the disjointed storytelling in the disappointing LEGO Marvel’s Avengers, The Force Awakens uses dialogue from the film effectively. The story of Rey, Finn, and company follows the same path as the movie, while also throwing in a bunch of really clever gags and goofs.   Wandering through the ruins of Maz Kanada’s castle, overhearing some weird creatures talk about where they’re going to drink next, and having one of them suggest his old watering hole on Tatooine left a big dumb grin on my face. It even handles heavy events, like that Big Spoilery Thing™ with a solid dose of humor and charm.  I loved scouring each level for all of their secrets. “ Each level in the eight-hour campaign does a great job of spreading out puzzle solutions between multiple characters and their unique abilities. Unlike LEGO Avengers, where the second player oftentimes found themselves bored, here you’ll need each character’s inherent abilities to make it through a level. Plus, the abilities are generally fun to use -- Rey’s agility creates some great platforming segments, while BB-8’s ability to jack into any electrical outlet allows you to fiddle around and manipulate platforms and other objects in the world. Whether I was playing by myself or alongside a pal, I really enjoyed scouring each level for all of their secrets.  That said, certain puzzle mechanics are dull and used a bit too often. For example, playing as Finn and having to line up the head and torsos of a holographic Stormtrooper to enter a First Order door quickly transforms from a light challenge into a chore.   While the destroy, build, and collect mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played a LEGO game, The Force Awakens tosses in some new and unique scenarios that surprised me with how fun they were. Specifically, cover-based shootouts that feel like “My First Gears of War.” These sections were totally unexpected, but really helped deliver some diversity to the familiar gameplay loop. Add in the fact that each character has a special meter that allows you to destroy the battlefield with a cool-looking unique attack, and Force Awakens has the best-feeling action of any LEGO game yet.  Flying levels are fun, frantic, and more entertaining than this year’s Star Fox Zero. “ Likewise, the flying sections -- both the on-rails and open-air dogfights -- are fun, frantic, and honestly more entertaining than this year’s Star Fox Zero. Whether I was jetting through an asteroid field, gunning down TIE Fighters on my way off of Jakku, or saving the Resistance as Poe on the shores of Takodana, I looked forward to every scene where I got to hop into the cockpit of a ship. I couldn’t help but imagine what Travelers Tales would do with a full-on Rogue Squadron game.  While I love the individual levels, I’m a bit disappointment by the hub worlds. Unlike the awesome, interconnected core of LEGO Harry Potter’s Hogwarts, this series of small hubs here are disjointed and require fairly lengthy load screens to pop between them. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it adds some frustration when you want to check out a bunch of different challenges and worlds.  LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens is also filled with cute, smart nods that Star Wars nuts are going to love. Scouring the galaxy for slabs of carbonite that unlock characters from the original trilogy and the prequels is a blast. Likewise, there are rad secret missions that fill in the gaps of certain events left out of the film, with one of the more memorable ones featuring Poe on his rescue mission to snatch Admiral Ackbar. All of this constantly compelled to keep playing on my mission to 100% it.",

        "Content": "How best to show off exciting new technology? Apparently with an 11-year-old game that's been given minimal graphical improvements and doesn't do anything interesting or new. Don't let the name fool you, Rayman 3D is not a new game made for Nintendo's 3DS. It's actually Rayman 2: The Great Escape, originally released in 1999. Don't bother buying it.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love Rayman 2. It's one of my favorite games. But it looks old, feels old, and it isn't doing anything interesting for a DS game, much less a 3DS game. The touch screen just tracks your collectibles -- it's never used for any real function -- and the visuals have been given only a minor retouching. Yes, Rayman 2 is one of the greatest platformers of all time, but Ubisoft wasted any of its potential for Nintendo's new system. At least the things that were good about Rayman 2 remain for the \"new\" Rayman 3D.   Rayman 3DS fails to celebrate Nintendo's future. Rayman 3D is a whimsical platformer where you jump, swing, shoot and slide your way through a series of imaginative levels. There's something very childlike about Rayman, in a good way. It's like playing through one of Walt Disney's weird esoteric French dreams where Mickey Mouse is an abstract character with no arms, legs, or neck. There's a real sense of wonder and charm to Rayman and the goofy characters he meets along the way. They're all cartoonish and even silly, but the situations Rayman's placed in have the dire realism of a childhood playground fantasy.  As Rayman, you only have a handful of moves. Jumping and shooting balls of energy from your hand account for a good majority of the game. There's a fair amount of combat, which is quickly paced and requires some fast reflexes to avoid getting hit by incoming attacks. The combat adds a bit of tension to some of the slower platforming sections. There are lots of little tweaks here and there that make each successive level more interesting than the last, but at its core, Rayman 3D is built as a traditional platformer where precision jumping is required to avoid death.  The core game is still there. In fact, there's nothing really here but what was released a decade ago. The Circle Pad is used to maneuver our neckless hero and it works just fine. Rayman 3D is designed for analog control. Push ever so slightly on the Circle Pad and you move slowly. Push a lot and you run. Movement makes sense with a stick and not on the touch screen, but couldn't that screen be used for something? Heck, I don't know, maybe some additional content that I didn't play on my N64?  Worse is that few of the issues from original game have been fixed with the 3D re-release. The primary problem is the camera, which can sometimes point in the wrong direction. And there are times when you'll be headed one way, the camera switches angles, and suddenly the controls are flipped around and Rayman turns around for no reason. Bad enough to have that in any game -- worse to leave that in after a decade and add nothing of real value while you're at it.  THE 3D Effect Cranking up the 3D doesn't do much for the visuals, which look outdated even on the brand new 3DS. It's neat to see some elements that once faded into the background have a bit more prominence, but jaws will not drop. No one is likely to be convinced of the power of the 3DS by looking at Rayman 3D. This is not the Avatar of gaming.  There are a few moments when the 3D does help the gameplay just a touch. In particular, the rare top-down sections, where you guide Rayman as he descends, benefit from the depth of field created by 3D. That's about all Ubisoft could manage on this one.  I'm all for reviving classic games so new generations can enjoy them, but it has to have some new element. Whether that's the graphics being redone to add a bit of wow, real refinements to the gameplay, or new levels no one's seen before -- there has to be a reason for this to exist on the hot, cutting edge bit of technology. The 3D is half-hearted in its implementation and adds nothing outside of the cheap gimmick of 3D butterflies flittering in the foreground. ",

        "Content": "2010 was a good year for Danish indie developers Press Play. That year, Max & the Magic Marker won multiple awards, including the Direct2Drive Vision award during the Independent Games Festival. Originally created for PC and then Wii, Max comes this month to iTouch and iPhone, a move that by all accounts, should be money in the bank. Unfortunately, awkward controls and too many repetitive levels make Max's marker not so much magic as mediocre.  Max & the Magic Marker is about an imaginative little boy who loves to draw. One day, as he's relaxing at home doing some sketches, a mysterious package arrives with nothing but an orange marker in it. Max can't help but take the new marker for a spin and by drawing with it, brings to life a blobby, purple villain called Mustachio (who looks a lot like Grimace from the old McDonald's commercials, wearing a handlebar mustache). Realizing he's unleashed a great evil upon the innocent world of his imagination, he uses the marker to bring an avatar of himself to life in order to go into the drawings and defeat the evil Mustachio.   Max & the Magic Marker  As in the Wii and PC versions, the two-pronged concept behind the iOS version of Max & the Magic Marker is to navigate the 2D, side-scrolling environment by jumping and using the magical marker to solve various platform puzzles. You help Max gain access to places that are out of reach by drawing ramps, boxes, stairs and hooks. You also use drawings to fight off mini-versions of Mustachio—mean little gobos—by smashing them with drawn shapes. This works really well, and in some ways the touch screen makes the drawing process easier than the controls in previous versions do. Sadly, there's where the improvement ends and from then on, the mobile version of the game exhibits the same troublesome issues found on both PC and Wii.  The worst thing to have in a platformer is sluggish controls. Max & the Magic Marker is dogged by this problem. It attempts to implement a set of onscreen virtual left/right/jump buttons but these are at times too responsive, and at others, not responsive enough. As a consequence, cleverly designed levels that should present a healthy challenge become largely annoying as you find yourself fighting against controls that seem to sabotage your every intent. The mobile game also falls victim to the repetitiveness of the PC and Wii versions and adds even more levels (there are three themed worlds containing fifty-eight levels; twenty in the first two and eighteen in the last) that for the little variance they contribute, could just as well have been left out.

        "Subheader": "By Tristan Ogilvie Updated: May 4, 2012 11:15 pm Posted: Nov 2, 2010 5:00 pm",
        "Content": "There's one James Bond game coming out this year that's got 007 fans cocking their golden guns in anticipation. Then there's Blood Stone 007. While Wii and DS owners are being treated to a re-imagining of one of the most beloved console shooters of all time in GoldenEye 007, Xbox 360 and PS3-owning Bond fans have to make do with a consolation prize in the form of a third-person shooter from Project Gotham Racing makers, Bizarre Creations . And as far as consolation prizes go, this is about as comforting as an open-mouthed kiss from Dame Judi Dench.  Dench and Daniel Craig reprise their roles of M and Bond in Blood Stone 007, while pop singer Joss Stone steps in as the token Bond girl Nicole Hunter. And those are basically the only obligations to the Bond license that this game fulfills. Otherwise there are no memorable villains, no signature gadgets – even the Bond theme music doesn't properly play until the final credits roll – and the only moment even vaguely resembling any form of fan service is the time you get to briefly step behind the wheel of the Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger, albeit for no apparent reason. Otherwise this could be any other bog standard third-person shooter with Daniel Craig's expressionless face smeared across it.    The plot has you chasing biochemical terrorists across a handful of exotic locations in Europe and Asia, and at times the game can be quite visually striking – like when you're escaping an exploding oil refinery in Siberia, or chasing a monolithic earth mover across crumbling highway overpasses in Bangkok. Unfortunately such moments are both fleeting and few and far between, and Blood Stone's five hour campaign is mostly padded out with repetitive firefights against brainless henchmen in bland and texturally inconsistent concrete environments.  Aside from the use of explosive barrels to take out your opposition – which comes direct from chapter one, page one of the FPS textbook – the main hook to Blood Stone's otherwise generic cover-based combat is the Focus Aim feature, which is basically a carbon copy of Splinter Cell: Conviction's Mark and Execute system, only in this case it doesn't really present any genuinely strategic benefits to the gameplay. For every context-sensitive melee takedown you perform on an enemy (Bond smashes their face into a table top and/or cuddles them into a deep sleep) you're awarded a Focus kill – and you're able to store up to three of them at any one time. When activated the Focus Aim mechanic allows you to swiftly dispatch enemies with a few quick button taps.  On the game's lower difficulty levels, Focus Aim is entirely unnecessary thanks to the Call of Duty-style targeting that automatically snaps to an enemy each time you zoom in, making it easy to pull off headshots without the need for any further assistance. But even on the higher difficulty levels there's no tangible gameplay rewards for being stealthy, so whilst Focus Aim might be a slightly quicker and more stylish way to dispatch enemy goons it's far from essential, and at times we forgot it was even there.    Bond's smartphone can be used to display your current mission objective in the HUD, along with the location of enemies in your vicinity even if they're concealed behind walls, as well as scan for evidence and hack keypads and the like. Too bad it doesn't also let you play a copy of Angry Birds, because the smartphone is the closest you'll come to getting your hands on any kind of gadget from Q branch, otherwise your only tools are an assortment of samey assault rifles and shotguns, and the odd grenade launcher. Fair enough the Daniel Craig Bond films haven't featured many gadgets either, and Bizarre has tried to ape the style of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, but when the lack of gameplay variety as a result is detrimental to the overall experience, we think the developer should have been afforded some artistic license. Strictly as a shooting experience, Blood Stone can only be described as uninspired.  But when you're not shooting cookie cutter enemies or idly staring at your smartphone like a bored teenager, you're speeding along in sports cars and powerboats in one of the handful of vehicular sections in the game. These high-octane interludes are easily the standout portions of the single-player campaign, and although they're slightly unforgiving in terms of the instant deaths caused by head-on collisions and wrong turns into bodies of water, they at least kick start your flat lining enthusiasm levels as though each vehicle is packing a set of the glove box defibrillators from Casino Royale.   Sam Fisher's Daniel Craig mask was the hit of the Halloween houseboat party.  It's too bad then that cars and boats are entirely absent from the game's online multiplayer component, which consists of just three uninspired shooter game types – Team Deathmatch, Objective and Last Man Standing. You can level up and unlock new character skins, but otherwise there's very little gameplay meat here. Some Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit-style car chases with friends would have been appreciated, but as far as multiplayer experiences go, Blood Stone's seems very much like a last minute afterthought and is unlikely to extend the lifespan of the game by more than an hour or two at best.  Blood Stone won't just disappoint fans of 007, it will also frustrate those familiar with just how capable a studio Bizarre Creations is. The British developer consistently excelled with its acclaimed Project Gotham Racing series, and subsequently displayed versatility with The Club, an underrated yet fast paced and addictive shooting experience. And yet here we are with a game that combines dangerous driving with third-person shooting – clearly two of Bizarre's strengths – and the studio has come up well short of greatness. We're not sure if it's due to the restrictive nature of working with the Bond license, or if the game has been focus-tested within an inch of its life – completely stripping it of any real depth or innovation in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator – but Blood Stone is a shallow and short-lived husk of a game. It won't keep you entertained for an afternoon so much as it will merely pass the time. ",

        "Subtitle": "Look no further - the perfect realization of Pokémon on the DS has arrived.",
        "Subheader": "By Audrey Drake Posted: Oct 4, 2012 2:08 am",
        "Content": "Don’t underestimate Pokémon Black Version 2. Rather than just a slightly expanded repackaging of the latest generation’s core titles (a la Pokémon Yellow, Crystal, Emerald or Platinum), this direct sequel breaks the Pokémon mid-generation mold by offering a brand new adventure in the Unova region. What you might expect is more of the same - and for the most part, that’s what you get. Considering the caliber of what came before , this certainly isn’t a bad thing - but Black 2 manages to complement this “same” with some truly apt refinements and a stunning amount of fresh content. The final result is a game that features some of the most cinematic moments the franchise has ever seen, and the most fully realized Pokémon game to ever make use of the DS hardware. To start, it’s important to understand that Pokémon Black 2 doesn’t seek to upend the basic Pokémon formula, simply to refine and expand it. You can expect to employ the same expertly crafted, turn-based mechanics as ever, catch a variety of fantastical creatures and acquire eight gym badges - but don’t let the similarities fool you. Pokémon Black 2 also offers an overwhelming amount of new content. In addition to new main characters, new areas and a new storyline, the revamped Unova region supplies copious amounts of entertainment for your journey to Victory Road. Gyms have always played an important role in the Pokémon experience, and they’re at their best in Black 2. The gyms themselves are far grander than in previous games. You’ll find Elesa’s roller coasters supplemented by a booming catwalk, Burgh’s gym covered in silk cocoons – and, while I won’t spoil it for you, suffice to say that Drayden’s domain presents an epic homage to the dragon-tamer’s type of choice. Additional opportunities to test your team and flex your skills include the Pokémon World Tournament, a new in-game event where you can face off against gym leaders and champions from past titles. The inclusion of a constantly running tourney is a brilliant addition, as it provides an exciting venue for honing your battle skills, and it’s a pleasure re-challenging some of the most iconic characters from the franchise’s rich history. While battling is still the game’s main draw, a multitude of other activities round out the finely balanced experience. PokéStar Studios, for instance, lets you make miniature movies with your favorite monsters while testing your knowledge of type advantages. It’s in the same vein as the Pokémon Musicals, which are returning from Black and White - both are a tad frivolous compared to the rest of the game, but as an optional diversion they’re quite amusing if you’re in the right mood. There’s also Join Avenue, an area populated by trainers you’ve connected with via the game’s seamless IR, wireless and online communications. While it’s fun hanging out with your friends’ avatars, the main draw here is the variety of specialty shops you can encourage them to set up, each offering a range of unique goods or services for your shopping pleasure. The series continues to advance portable multiplayer in other ways as well, with additions like the revamped Entralink’s new Fun Fest Missions. The incredible thing about these quests - which range from chasing down berries to catching Pokémon - is that they allow up to 100 players to connect locally and simultaneously experience the Unova region together. Paired with the Xtransceiver, an impressive video chat feature returning from Black and White, these options present a fun way for fellow trainers to easily connect, interact, and arrange matches or trades on the fly. Pokémon collecting has also been improved for Black 2, made far easier by the game’s innovative Habitat List function. A new feature of your Pokédex, the Habitat List allows you to track which monsters you’ve encountered and caught in each location. This makes it incredibly simple to systematically clear each area, filling out your dex along the way. It’s a brilliant tool, especially for Pokémon completionists, and served to completely reignite my desire to catch ‘em all. It helps that the game boasts the largest regional Pokédex yet, with nearly 300 monsters spanning all five generations. This allows for far greater variety in the monsters you encounter, and also means there’s plenty of opportunity to fill your dex without looking to past games. A handful of other supplementary features further elevate and flesh out the experience, such as the new medal system. Medals are basically the Pokémon equivalent to achievements or trophies, and offer great incentive to challenge yourself on your Pokémon journey. The game has more than 200 medals for dedicated trainers to earn for things like checking all the trashcans for hidden items or winning lots of battles at the Battle Subway. The new Unova is also home to secret areas called Pokémon Grottoes, where you can nab yourself some rare items or monsters. Locating these grottoes is no small feat, but it’s incredibly fulfilling when you do, especially considering the variety of prizes you can collect from these regenerating hideouts. The new key system also represents a great stride for the franchise. With a handful of “keys” to collect by fulfilling certain requirements (like beating the game or capturing a certain Pokémon), Black 2 allows you to manipulate the game in ways you never could before. With the right key you can actually change the game’s difficulty from normal to either hard or easy, a first for the series. It’s a remarkably successful way to allow for further customization of your game experience, and the ability to trade keys between versions means players who don’t meet the requirements can still get in on the action.  The story presented in Black and White was easily the most captivating in series history, and Black 2 only deepens and expands the narrative set forth in those games. The renewed threat of the reformed Team Plasma (and the clash between the members who just wanted power and those who really thought N was helping Pokémon) adds fresh context and depth to this scenario, and culminates in a truly epic conclusion. While the story stands on its own, watching this arc come to a close should prove especially fulfilling for fans of Black and White. Considering this direct sequel continues the previous game’s story (albeit with a new main hero and new motivations), it’s remarkable how fresh and new it all feels. While you revisit many of the same towns and routes, most have seen significant changes in the two years since the original games. You’ll also find several entirely new places to explore, and some of the returning areas are nearly unrecognizable. The small town of Driftveil, for instance, has positively boomed, largely thanks to the newly established Pokémon World Tournament. Returning characters have also grown with the passing of time, and it’s a great joy to see not only how Unova has changed and prospered, and but also how time has treated old friends like Cheren (now a full-fledged gym leader) and Bianca (now assisting Professor Juniper as she tries to figure herself out). As an additional reward for players who beat Black or White, Black 2 comes with the new Memory Link system, which unlocks supplementary vignettes if you link your copy of the game with your Black/White save file. While they’re not necessary for enjoying or understanding Black 2’s story, these short snippets serve to shed light on what took place in the two years between games. Linking your save files also means characters in Black 2 mention “the hero who saved Unova” by name, a cool nod for those who took the time to stop Team Plasma the first time around. Much like Black and White, Black 2 employs a blended use of 2D sprite art and 3D graphics. The resulting visual style is at its most impressive here, and the expanded yet subtle use of 3D makes for some truly epic and cinematic moments as the story progresses. Black 2 also boasts four distinct seasons. You’ll see Unova covered in powdery snow, piles of fallen leaves and puddles of fresh spring rain, visual effects that are not only lovely, but also inform the accessibility of certain areas and affect how you traverse the environment. Much like the rest of the package, the visual presentation of Black 2 perfectly realizes the potential of the Pokémon series on DS hardware. The fog in the trees, the sweeping caves and mountains fading into the distance, your footprints in the sand and reflection in the water - small touches like these make for a beautiful and memorable world that is brimming with life.",

        "Content": "You might remember the thrill of your first teenage party: Maybe you snuck out; perhaps there were older kids there; there was definitely beer. If Mario Party 10 is your first Mario Party, I think you're going to have a great time. If, like me, you've been Mario Partying for 17 years straight, you might feel like quietly slipping out the back. Mario Party 10 adds a bunch of new features including amiibo, and the second screen of the GamePad, but it also carries over some bad ideas from Mario Party 9 that continue to deflate the fun. Mario Party's core idea (a virtual board game with minigames to shake things up) is smart, but recent iterations have dropped the more complex rules and options that make board games interesting in the first place. Mario Party 10's game boards are linear, with little complexity. Dice rolls move all characters together in one vehicle on rails, meaning fate – not strategy or skill – decides pretty much everything but minigames. And here's the kicker: In the main Mario Party mode, a new rule change means you don't actually get to play the minigames that often. So what is the point of this, exactly? 26 Images When you get to play them the minigames are great. They often take advantage of Super Mario 3D World's aesthetic and gameplay – right down to clear pipes and squirrels. It looks great in HD, and makes four-player split-screen minigames much easier to follow. The technical improvements aren't without hiccups, though: load times before and after each minigame can get pretty long. The best minigames have the partiers navigating obstacle courses of moving and/or vanishing platforms by running and jumping, using the Wii Remote like an NES controller. You know: Mario stuff. In one game, platforms disappear into lava, leaving survivors on tiny islands with just enough room for you to edge an opponent into the goop. Your old Wii Remotes get plenty of use in their various motion-based modes, too: Track a certain Goomba in a crowd and point at it with your crosshairs; waggle the Wiimote until your balloon nearly bursts, then hold it really still so an extra waggle doesn't push it past its breaking point. There are some less fun tilt-based games, like a soccer match on giant balls that will have you contorting to win. Motion controls may sound regressive in 2015, but in the thick of the Mario Party, it's all goofy fun. I wish I could tell you to just play Mario Party for the minigames, but you actually don't get to play that many of them. In Mario Party mode, you only play a minigame if you land on a minigame space – and they’re rare enough that it's entirely possible to play an entire game without hitting one. Minilame! Bowser Party Mode Bowser Party not only introduces a fifth player to the party, but also makes use of the Wii U GamePad – a fittingly large controller for the role of Bowser as master party crasher. In this mode, up to four players share a car and roll dice to flee from Bowser on one of three boards shared with Mario Party mode (two are unavailable for some reason) while Bowser rolls a handful of dice in an attempt to catch up at the end of each turn. If Bowser catches up, he takes on the four other players in a 1v4 minigame. Interestingly, these games are balanced individually to favor either Bowser or the partiers. As Bowser gets more \"angry\" throughout a match, the minigames you play will be tilted in his favor. Playing as Bowser is a blast: You blow fire at scurrying players; mess with their minds by rotating and stopping a giant wheel that throws them into flames; and officiate a game of BINGO that the partiers pretty much always lose. You do all this with your own screen and set of controls, so others can't see your scheming. I highly recommend the submarine game board, where the Bowser player gets to draw on the GamePad to try and trick players into choosing the wrong path on the big screen. You don't actually have that much psychological sway, but taunting with GamePad graffiti is totally gratifying. Whether you are Bowser or not, this five-person modification of Mario Party is 10's greatest achievement – and one of the best uses of the Wii U GamePad yet. Amiibo Party Mode Amiibo Party requires Nintendo's interactive toys (amiibo), but amiibo aren't exactly the life of the party. Each player must keep an amiibo and a Wii Remote on hand at all times, with the GamePad sitting at some place within reach of all players (which was awkward both in my living room and in the office). The integration of amiibo amounts to little more than constantly tapping the figures to a sensor in the corner of the GamePad. You tap to roll, tap to stop random spinners, tap to use items… You tap the GamePad a lot. In between amiibo tapping, you play an old-school version of Mario Party: You get to move as separate characters (yay!), and there's a minigame after each round (yay!), but there's a huge catch: The game boards in this mode are small, linear, squares. You can swap out corners of the squares with different Mario themes, but they left me and my fellow partiers yawning. And tapping. Bonus Feature Lurking in Mario Party 10's bonus menu is a great standalone game called Jewel Drop, which captivated the office for a few hours one day. It's a clever color-matching game not unlike Dr. Mario, but with a spin: Physics apply. Your stacks of jewels can collapse, or you can intentionally shake them up to make a bunch of matches and slam your opponent with a deluge of Jewels.",

        "Content": "Of the five Summer of Arcade games being released this year, gamers may be most anticipating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled .  It was originally built for arcades back in 1991 and eventually made its way to the Super Nintendo, and many a Ninja Turtle fan has fond memories of hacking and slashing through hordes of Foot soldiers with three of their buds.  I'm going to guess they haven't played the game in almost 20 years, though, and their enthusiasm is being fueled purely by their nostalgia, because Turtles in Time has not aged well.  There's nothing to it: hold right on your D-pad and mash the X button and you'll beat the game in half an hour.  The beat 'em up genre has been kept alive with outstanding efforts like Castle Crashers that build on the foundation TMNT provided, but returning to this archaic example now only points out how much games have improved since 1991.  What worked back then doesn't necessarily cut it today.  Like the other licensed arcade games Konami produced in the early '90s, Turtles in Time lets up to four players cooperate through side-scrolling levels, beating up cronies and fighting a cheap boss at the end of each stage.  These games were designed to eat quarters, after all, so you'll find many traps are unavoidable and certain bad guys have unfair advantages (bosses can heal themselves, for example).  You have unlimited continues, though, so the game never becomes truly challenging -- just annoying.   Check out the video review of TMNT: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled.   In terms of fan service, Turtles in Time gets some things right.  You've got your four turtles, they make their cheesy little comments, you fight a bunch of recognizable enemies, and you get a brief glimpse of April O'Neil's cleavage.  But it makes little difference which Turtle you choose to control.  Everyone knows the mutants all had distinct personalities and talents, but here they all control the same way, have virtually the same attacks save for a \"special move\" (which is just the heavy attack), and they spout the same generic one-liners.  At the character selection screen you'll see different stats for speed and range, but in-game you can hardly tell the Turtles apart.  This also makes it near impossible to keep track of where your fighter is when four people are playing.  Turtles in Time is the kiddie pool of game mechanics.  All that is expected of you is to pound on the attack buttons and dodge a few traps.  It's a rather mind-numbing experience that fails to offer much more than a quick trip down memory lane for those that were there.  The one gameplay difference that has been added is the ability to attack in eight directions instead of just left and right. This probably makes the game a little easier since it increases your attack range, but otherwise the original gameplay is faithfully reproduced.  Microsoft just dropped the price of Turtles in Time Re-shelled from the laughable $15 it was originally planning on to $10, but that still feels like too much.  The original Ninja Turtles arcade game is available on Xbox Live Arcade for $5, which makes it much easier to overlook its shortcomings.   You can throw enemies into your TV screen -- one of the more amusing aspects of the game. Turtles in Time is definitely not broken, though, and there is some fun stuff to see along the way.  Foot soldiers can be thrown into your TV screen; during a level that takes place on a moving train enemies will struggle to maintain their balance; the updated graphics engine sports some nice lighting effects.  It would have been nice to have the option to turn off the fancy pants new visuals and enjoy the original sprites and pixels, though.  The requisite Xbox Live bells and whistles have been added for this release.  You can jump to any level in Quickplay and enjoy 99 lives, or see how far you can get with just one life in Survival.  And, of course, now four Turtles can fight cooperatively over Xbox Live (local co-op is still in there, too).",

        "Content": "I kind of dreaded picking up TxK -- not because I didn’t want to play Llamasoft’s psychedelic tube shooter, but because it’s one of those addictive distractions that’s exceptionally difficult to put down. Something about its pulsing electronic soundtrack and score attack setup trapped me in a near-infinite loop of “just one more try” for at least a few hours longer than I’d intended to play. This is essentially Tempest, a classic Atari arcade game (technically the spiritual successor of Tempest 2000) and even an updated look can’t obscure its retro roots. For the uninitiated, Tempest locks your little ship to the edge of a plane that extends from the foreground down into the background. Your job is to whip around the edge of the plane and shoot enemies as they travel up the various lanes towards the front of the screen. In essence, it’s an intense juggling act that endlessly tests your coordination and awareness -- a simple but deeply engaging formula that’s endured for over 30 years now. Tempest 2000 smartly expanded on the original idea by adding power-ups, enemy projectiles, and other clever mechanics, all of which TxK dutifully recreates. Those planes, for example, now come in a massive variety of shapes, from the perfectly geometric to totally abstract. Later levels even begin to move, morph, and overlap themselves, all of which makes movement a bit disorienting. If you’re willing to accept that as part of the challenge, however, TkX’s 100 unique playing fields provide both gameplay variety and a nail-biting moment of anticipation as each new level loads (which, given the lighting-fast pace, happens pretty frequently). Should the challenge ever prove too great, TkX arms you with a variety of tools that add further nuance to the experience. Though you begin each level with only a “Supertrapper” smart bomb that obliterates anything on screen for double the points, you can also earn an AI helper drone and the ability to “jump,” which allows you to shoot down enemies who’ve already reached your edge of the plane. Power-ups like these are not only the surest path to a high score, they’re also fundamental to your survival (unless you’re some kind of Jedi Master). The fact that they’re actually useful is serious motivation to dive across the screen before one disappears into the abyss, creating compelling moments of tension and reward that never failed to tap into my primal gamer adrenaline reserve. But this is all old news. This gameplay is fun because it’s always been fun. Where TxK really stands out from both its predecessor and the original is how it looks and sounds. The art style retains a little of that classic vector flavor, but they’re now painted in glowing pastel hues and surrounded by glorious explosions. This glossy modern interpretation is certainly gorgeous, but it’s also somewhat chaotic, especially in later levels. More than a few times I died and had absolutely no idea what hit me. As you might imagine, not being able to discern enemies and projectiles from allies and power-ups is pretty problematic in a twitchy game like Tempest. Fortunately, TxK actually improves Tempest 2000’s already-ingenious save system. While you can choose to start from scratch every time in Pure and Survival modes (the latter of which eliminates all powers-up, including extra lives), Classic mode automatically saves your best stats for every level you reach. If you make it to the 20th stage with four lives and a hefty score, you can forever choose to start at level 20 with those lives and that score. Even better, the music -- which is nearly as entrancing as the graphics -- never quits, even when you get a game over. It’s almost as if TxK is subtly encouraging you to hop right back into the action, and more often than not, I was happy to oblige. In fact, aside from the title screen, there’s basically nothing to pull you out of the experience: no ammo counters, no “stage cleared” screens, just the occasional non-sequitur like “Eat your vegetables” flashing across the screen for...well, no apparent reason. The momentum this creates is an excellent match for TxK’s frantic, addictive gameplay, and while it’s sort of impossible to give it credit for originality, at least we can appreciate its execution.",

        "Content": "When I think back on my time with plucky cyberpunk beat-em-up Anno: Mutationem, the first thing I think of is that I wish they'd included a pronunciation guide for that mouthful of a faux Latin title. But the second thing that comes to mind is attitude. From the colorful, retro chic art style to the endearing, ass-kicking protagonist, this is a world with a strong sense of identity that knows from the first minute how it wants to make you feel – even though the story told there sometimes seems a bit more lost. The streets of futuristic Skopp City are where most of the action takes place: it’s a delightful chrome and concrete sprawl packed with influences from the likes of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. Its various districts each use color, sound, and small environmental details to create a textured world that manages to feel bright and homey in spite of its bleak backstory. I had a lot of fun exploring its bars, shops, and alleyways, listening to random conversations and discovering out-of-the-way secrets. It's not exactly a groundbreaking setting – though some Stranger Things-esque weirdness brings a dash of spice to it – but it's one I would happily spend a lot more time in. Anno: Mutationem Gameplay Screenshots 10 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! 💡 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask When trouble comes to these streets, the capable and daring Ann Flores is ready to shoot, slash, and smash her way through hordes of thugs, robots, and mutants. Combat is responsive, well-paced, and in its best moments the enemy design and flow of battle reminded me of old-school Mega Man. There are plenty of interesting and challenging bosses and lieutenants to pound to a pulp, and the fact that you need to wear down their shields with slower heavy attacks to unlock powerful finishers, while dealing damage with quicker light attacks, makes each scrap more tactically interesting than button mashing away at a health bar. The one kind of annoying thing is that there are a few too many encounters that rely on infinitely respawning minions for my taste. There are lots of ways to make a boss fight harder, and I'm just not fond of that one. Training Arc Ann's progression as a professional ass kicker comes from two skill trees, where beating story bosses gives you currency to improve your base stats and beating normal enemies lets you unlock new moves. This ends up working out really well, because you can't really grind to become way too powerful for any given area, but earning yourself a new heavy slash or improving the effectiveness of your parry provides you with more tools to experiment with and put together the the right fighting style for tougher encounters. A lot of the main story takes place off the grid in lengthy, varied dungeon crawls that create a sense of isolation and are a nice contrast to running around town doing odd jobs. There's always a hint that they're part of a slowly unraveling mystery, but this didn't save me from feeling like I was kind of being led by my nose with too thin of a connecting motivation. The places you get to explore along the way, from a secret lab full of mutant plants to a hidden civilization of cyborgs, are genuinely interesting and weave into a richly detailed world. It's just missing a smoother flow between them to save it from turning into a whirlwind tour that sometimes seems much less interested in why you're discovering these places than it is in the places themselves. The huge, colorful cast of characters represents both one of Anno's most visible strengths and weaknesses. There's limited voice acting, but where it pops up, it's really well done. Especially Ann herself, voiced in English by the fantastic Suzie Yeung, who comes across as a confident and driven young woman trying to make sense of a mysterious and traumatic past. The dialogue writing itself, though, isn't quite as impressive. There are a lot of times where what's being spoken doesn't match up with the written captions on screen, and far too many conversations felt like rushed exposition that wasn't presented in a very naturalistic way. BFFs Sometimes Anno simply throws too many new characters at you, often in one-off cutscenes that won't make any sense until much later in the 20-hour story. While some of the reveals are definitely cool and I like how they've put a weird, metaphysical spin on the cyberpunk genre, it felt like maybe the plot was a bit too intricate for its own good. It is trying to do too much, with too many cast members who don't get enough time to develop or make an impact. What little I saw of characters like Ann's snarky sister Nakamura or the moody cowboy Raymond made me want to get to know them better, but they're simply shuffled on and off the stage too quickly. The one person you do get to spend plenty of time with is Ann's best friend Ayane. And, well, I love you girl, but you're just a bit much sometimes. The bubbly, manic, aggressively gay sidekick who follows you around in the form of a hologram is an effective foil to Ann's straightforward stoicism, but also reminds me of some of the overcaffeinated anime addicts I hung out with in college, and I often just wished I could tell her to tone it down a couple notches. In her defense, she does sometimes break out of being a living stereotype with moments of emotional depth. What part of a cyberpunk future would you be most excited about?

        "Content": "Games like Dreamkiller are the only proof I need that this job is not always as attractive as it appears on the surface. While it's true that we get to play all of the greatest games around, that also means we're also frequently obliged to plod our way through many of the less inspired, less amusing games that come our way. Such is the case with Dreamkiller. I was actually mildly looking forward to this game based solely on its premise. After all, the concept of a Painkiller-style shooter that takes place in the dreams of phobia patients is ripe with possibilities. In the end, the game wound up being far less enjoyable than it promised. Let's look at the concept first. It's not always fair to judge a game based on the game that you thought it ought to have been, but with an idea as charged as Dreamkiller, it's hard not to regret the wasted potential. You play as Alice Drake, a sort of quasi-psychologist who can enter the minds of her patients and confront the enemies found deep within the psyche. I use the word \"confront\" here but that's really just a tidier way of saying that she goes into your brain, picks up a shotgun and shoots the crap out of everything she sees.  The game just doesn't take enough advantage of the limitless premise. It reminds me of Steve Martin's Saturday Night Live skit Theodoric, Barber of York: \"Why, just fifty years ago, they thought a disease like your daughter's was caused by demonic possession or witchcraft. Nowadays we know that Isabelle is suffering from an imbalance of bodily humors, perhaps caused by a toad or a small dwarf living in her stomach.\" I'm not saying that the game can't get by with a bizarre premise, but the appeal of the peculiar concept is destroyed by the predictable and repetitive execution. The rich possibilities of a game set entirely within dreamers' tortured psyches are largely ignored in favor of the standard types of levels and action we've already seen in dozens of other shooters. Oh, look! I'm using a laser to shoot demons in a gothic castle! I'm blasting lizards with my shotgun in an icy cave! I'm in an office building! Yawn. The few rare moments of genuine invention are so few and far between that you really forget the whole dream shtick that started this whole affair. Narrative connections are pretty thin as well. There are a few still-image cutscenes between the game's main chapters and a series of tragically short case files before each dream level, but that's all the concession the game is willing to make for the sake of a story. Even these are pretty flimsy. All of the phobia victims seem stuck in problems that run the gamut from totally predictable (fear of spiders) to the unnecessary (fear of demons) to the ridiculous (fear of overwork). It's almost as if the designers sat down with the Big Book O' Phobias and just selected the ones they thought would make cool game levels without trying to come up with any kind of coherent plan.  The trick to downing bosses is to not get bored while shooting them a million times. I get why the arachnophobia level is full of spiders. But why are those same spiders used again in the fear of overwork level? The presence of armored dogs and brutish soldiers seems equally arbitrary, almost as if these assets could fit into any generic shooter. You'll occasionally run into rooms that defy the laws of physics and begin to hint at the whole unreality of the setting but, for the most part, you're running through levels built of narrow hallways and uninteresting rooms. There are a few attempts to bring some symbolic content into the game but it just seems out of place. Moving past the conceptual problems, the game also suffers from some mechanical issues. It uses a system of gates that lock you into each tiny location until you've killed all the monsters in that location. Then the gate opens up and you can move to the next location. Then the gate closes behind you, more monsters spawn and the whole process repeats itself over again until you either finish the game or get smart enough to stop playing. Most of the rooms are fairly small so there's not a lot of tactical consideration here but you will occasionally get a space that you can really move around in, particularly so when you face the bigger baddies and bosses. The big boss battles are challenging not because of some special gimmick or tactic that you need to discover but purely because some of the enemies you face are obnoxiously resistant to damage. I found myself more than once just circle strafing an end boss for five or ten minutes just waiting to do enough damage to kill them. Thanks to the poor AI of their cronies, you can generally stay alive just by staying on the move. If you get too low on health, you can just pick up one of the red dreamcatchers (yes, really) that enemies sometimes drop when they die. There's also the issue of some confusing mechanics. Rather than simply running past hordes of enemies, you can activate a special teleport feature and warp right past them. The problem is that the game never tells you about this ability, so unless you happen to see it sitting there on the keyboard options page, you're not likely to discover it. You'll also likely be confused by the red glow that enemies take on when you rack up ten kills in quick succession. This is apparently some sort of bonus but you also see a different red glow that tells you that certain enemies are \"in the subconscious\" and the redness there simply means that you can't damage those enemies unless you find a portal to the subconscious. When you do, the enemies become their regular color, but the whole screen is washed out and blurry so it's hard to sort out the gray blob of your enemy from the gray blob of the background. Oh, and you start taking damage just for being alive if you spend too long in the subconscious.  Enemies hope to make up in numbers what they lack in intelligence. One of the most infuriating things about the weapons is the way you automatically switch out whatever weapon you're holding the instant you run over a new one. It's not unusual to be in the middle of a firefight and suddenly find your momentum broken by a suddenly switching to a different weapon. Since you leave the old one behind, you'll find yourself switching back and forth pointlessly as you move around in the fight. What's particularly stupid about this system is that if you're using the laser as your main weapon with a lightning gun as a backup and then run over another lightning gun, you automatically trade the laser for a second lightning gun. I know this may sound like kind of a minor problem but when you throw in the smaller levels, the need to keep moving around and the fact that the weapon pickups are sort of invisible, it really winds being a source of constant frustration. The game has multiplayer but as there is no one playing it, it hardly seems worth mentioning. Dreamkiller's visuals aren't particularly great but they're still probably the best part of the game. Many of the monster designs are fairly original and nicely detailed. It makes it a bit of a shame that they're so overused in the levels and that the gameplay encourages you to stay as far away from them as possible, but when you do get up on a creature, you can really appreciate the work that's gone into it. The levels are also generally well done, particularly when things get a bit more surreal, but even then, they feel a bit dated.  Seriously. What is wrong with her arm? The best parts of the audio are the ridiculous lines of dialogue. At one point, after Alice dispatches an army of terrifying half-spider, half-ghoul creatures and then enters a room that has big globs of matter just spinning around in the air, she caps it all by saying, \"Something's not right here.\" It's impossible to take the game seriously at that point. A bit later, she kills the end boss and proudly proclaims, \"The cobwebs in your attic are gone,\" to an audience of absolutely no one.",

        "Content": "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is like a mosquito stuck in crystallized amber. This 16-bit artifact captures the sliver of time between Jackson's pop ascendancy during the \"Thriller\" era and his tortuous downfall fueled by vanity and dark allegations. As such, it's nearly impossible to look back on his Genesis game completely severed from all of the horrible things we've heard about Jackson in recent years. What keeps this from being a complete exercise in futility is the almost relief felt when realizing this is one of the blandest action-platformers of the generation, saved from wholesale badness by strange sparkles of Jackson's kooky-cool. Because the game itself is banal, drubbing the game no longer feels like adding one more Corgi to the dogpile.    Moonwalker catches up to Michael Jackson in full \"Smooth Criminal\" regalia. He's a snap brimmed hero pushing through a juke joint full of Mr. Big's suited-up thugs and kidnapped children. Jackson must push back against this army of hooligans with his superior moves, such as a kick that's rooted in Jackson's own choreography. In what is surely an unintentional joke, our hero -- quite literally -- has \"twinkle toes.\" When Jackson kicks, magic stars float from his feet to take down enemies within the extended range.  Jackson's entire offensive is based on his dancing. When he jumps over pinball tables or on top of cars, his legs curl under him and his finger goes into the air. He can spin in place to charge his magic and then let loose with a hat attack that zips across the screen and knocks over incoming foes. Or he can go critical and inspire all of the on-screen thugs to join in his intoxicating dance set. Then there's the moonwalking, Jackson's velvet triumph -- a move used to scoot away from a successful attack and can be capped off with an emphatic crotch grab. It's just bizarre. And for a few minutes, the strangeness of Moonwalker is entertaining. How else will Jackson use his dancing to save the children?   Gimme that girl before I grab myself. OWWW!!  But this Z-movie \"so bad it's good\" charm is fleeting. Moonwalker is a lazily produced game. The stages are entirely monotonous, dressed up with repeating backdrops. Even worse, the enemies are paint-by-number thugs with zero personality and the same tailor. With only the occasional palette-switch, every level has just one or two enemy types that are on an endless loop, like a drum track in a Rockwell song. Compound this with the single line of AI code that drives each and every one: Run left/right and collide with Jackson. Dealing with these morons while searching doors and windows for missing kids across a dozen stages is woefully dull. Because you cannot fight the stage boss (which is typically just one or more of the stage's parade of repetitive thugs or zombies) until you find a set number of kids, you spend a lot of time backtracking around a level fighting the same enemies over and over.  When you do manage to find the final little girl, though, Moonwalker employs another dose of weird. Bubbles flies in on a star, lands on Jackson's shoulders, and then points the way to the boss encounter. Finding the boss is not a Herculean task, though. You just sorta walk into it. The presence of Bubbles in the game can only be explained then as something Jackson himself must have insisted upon. Oh, and if Bubbles and Jackson playing Master-Blaster isn't kooky enough for you, there is this an absolute mind-scrambler hidden in the game. It's a hold-over from the vastly superior arcade version of Moonwalker. If you rescue a specific child in the right order, Jackson turns into a robot. He can then shoot lasers out of his eyes. Again: Crazy.    The one upside of Moonwalker, however, is the music. Even though it's pure MIDI and on a constant loop, Jackson's songs are quite good. \"Smooth Criminal\" is indeed the highlight here, but the library of beep-boop songs, such as \"Billie Jean,\" are still reminders that no matter what you think of Jackson himself, he remains an incredible musician and performer.

        "Content": "is the next animated film set to be released by Disney, so along with the movie comes its accompanying set of games. Magenta Software has worked on the PSOne version of Treasure Planet for Disney Interactive, and the game seems to stick close to the movie's plot points and adventurous nature. The game is a platformer through and through, but it also throws in some Solar Surfing, which is pretty much sail boarding but solar style, to mix up the action a bit.  The game pits players as Jim Hawkins on his quest to find Treasure Planet and in search of riches. Accompanying Jim is Dr. Doppler, his scientist buddy who gives hints at the start of each level, and Morph, a small, shape changing, floating pink blob.   Gameplay  Control-wise, Treasure Planet plays much like every other platformer in existence. Along with the standard run, jump and double-jump for generally moving around the world, Jim has a sword and a musket with which to dispatch enemies and open crates or barrels. Morph is also able to change into a glider by pressing Triangle, which allows Jim to cross large gaps and make long jumps.  Jim controls well enough as he moves around, but there are some level interaction problems that can make the game a bit frustrating, especially in regards to ledges. Jim will sometimes be able to grab onto the edge of a platform that he wasn't quite able to jump to the top of. The problem is that some ledges will let you hang from the edge, and some won't. When making a long jump for the first time, you'll just have to hope that your landing spot will let you snag its edge in case you don't quite make it, otherwise there may be a long fall and a journey back up to your jump point to try again. Edges also present a problem when you need to move near them or navigate tight walkways. Some edges aren't solid in the manner that you'd expect them to be, and you may slide off the edge of a walkway when you don't expect it. Walking planks and whatnot can be a little unforgiving, and the only way to circumvent this is to walk very slow and carefully.  The game is broken up into a few different worlds and areas. They include Montressor, the Cresentia Spaceport, the RLS Legacy, and Treasure Planet itself. Each area has up to three different sections, including the basic level, a race, and possibly a boss to fight. In order to move on to later areas, you'll need to collect Treasure Planet Tokens. There are a few to be collected in each section, and each new area requires a certain amount of tokens before you can travel there. Most tokens are earned from one of a few ways. There are some characters that will have you complete a task, most of which involve an easy shooting or collection game of some sort. You can buy tokens from souvenir machines, earn one by collecting scrolls, or win a few by putting up good lap times in the race levels.  Along with collecting the necessary Treasure Planet Tokens, you're able to collect Gallery Tokens. These will unlock items in the Gallery option from the Main Menu, including movies, character images, and backgrounds. There are 12 items in each section of the gallery, for a total of 36 items to unlock. The confusing part about this is the fact that you don't need to collect every Gallery Token to open everything in the gallery. I was still missing a handful of Gallery Tokens at one point during my run through the game, and yet everything in all three galleries was unlocked for my viewing pleasure.  The levels are all very similar in the way they work, which while they all look different, makes it feel like you're completing the same tasks to move through the levels over and over. There are spots where you'll be able to charge your pistol and fire it from a reasonable distance, which is normally used to shoot crates and barrels up on ledges that you can't reach. There are many of these spots, but none are really hidden, so charging the pistol and then firing at a far off position just becomes an overly easy task, if not a tedious one. Every level also has doors that must be opened by finding Diodes and placing them in a certain door to power it. The Diodes are all simple to find, and are usually just placed on an easy to reach ledge, so collecting them and progressing through the level just requires randomly running around until you spot it. There isn't really any skill or puzzle solving required to navigate the levels. The only semi-hidden things in the levels are breakable walls, which are noticeable by the large cracks that run through them. Blasting them with your musket will open them, and there'll be something secret to collect, like a Gallery Token or scroll.   The act of finding Diodes and placing them in doors is practically the only requirement to make it to the end of each level, and as these tasks are overly simplistic, the game becomes extraordinarily boring. The only semi-difficult parts of the levels are trying to make some of the more unforgiving jumps, and those are more irritating than hard. Aside from the two boss fights, the enemies you face are almost all exactly the same. There are a few different characters, but they only attack in a total of three or four different ways.  The two boss fights are decent and have a bit of originality in the way you fight them, but they aren't as exciting as I think had been hoped. For example, the first fight is against a spider-like creature. The two of you are separated by a gap, so you can't just run over and attack him. He tosses some barrels at you, and occasionally a grenade. You must dodge barrels, pick up the grenades, and toss them back at him. After a few hits, he'll jump up on a moving crate, and attempt to use a flamethrower on you. Now you'll have to dodge the fire, while still tossing any grenades at him that come your way. The fights are cool in that they're a little unconventional and much different than fighting anything else in the game, but they're largely based around dodging stuff for a while, and waiting for an opening. The stuff you need to dodge is pretty simple, so the fights get to be a little slow and consequently a bit boring.  The race levels have you complete six laps with either your Solar Surfer or the RLS Legacy. You'll start with limited time, but there are clocks scattered throughout the track, and picking these up on each lap will add some time. There are also coins, gems, Gallery Tokens, and other things to collect as you round the track. You'll receive a Treasure Planet Token for your race time, with up to three tokens awarded if you beat the best time. The best times are pretty tight, so you'll have to race well in order to beat it. While messing up will slow you down enough that you'll miss the best time, and jumping can sometimes be unforgiving and may destroy your lap time if you fall in a pit, the races are slow and fairly easy. Once you've gone around the track a few times, you'll learn where everything you need to avoid is located, and the race becomes a snoozer.  One nice idea that severely lacks in execution is the use of actual scenes from the movie to push the storyline. It's awesome to see real scenes from the movie play out between each level, but the clips are reasonably short, and they don't have any sort of introduction to them. What ends up happening is that you'll see scenes from the movie, and sort of figure out what's happening, but how or why anything is going on is pretty much a mystery. There isn't any sort of storyline development during the play of the levels, so leaving the short clips to themselves to explain the story doesn't work. Of course, the game is being catered to people who will probably have seen the movie by the time they pick up the game, and they'll likely know what's going on, but for those that haven't seen the movie, it's just confusing.   Graphics  Even considering that Treasure Planet is running on last-generation hardware, it still looks bad. For starters, there's constant texture warping everywhere. It's bad enough that the levels look alive and breathing as you walk around, except that this isn't a survival-horror game. The warping doesn't stop with the textures, either. Some of the geometry will physically skew from time to time, and it's most common when there are two boxes stacked up. Unfortunately, there are boxes everywhere, so you'll see this quite a bit.  There are also many occasions where the game doesn't occlude objects properly, so something that is actually behind another object may be drawn in front of it instead of behind it. Objects randomly pop in and out of view from behind wall and boxes. The texture warping and depth problems are a common occurrence in many PSOne games, but this game has these problems much worse than most games, and it's hard to find a spot where something isn't being drawn incorrectly in some way.  Aside from these drawing problems, the game also suffers in the art department. Jim's running animation is laughably bad. The rest of his animations are pretty limited, and what animations he does have are pretty basic. Everything else in the game fares worse. The enemies walk around in a crippled manner, and they look pretty terrible to boot. Texture work is pretty terrible throughout the game. Everything has a pretty low color palette, so there's constant color banding pretty much everywhere, especially on the characters.    Sound   Treasure Planet 's sound ranges from decent to bad. Some of the effects match the game's style decently, but there's not a whole lot to them. The bulk of the sound that stands out is the character voices. Some of the character voices are great. David Hyde-Pierce voices Dr. Doppler, and he's great, and even a tad funny at some points. A couple of the unimportant NPC characters that give you tasks have great voices, though you'll really only talk to them once, and they don't have much to say.  On the other end of the spectrum is Jim's voice work. He's voiced by Third Rock from the Sun 's Joseph Gordon-Levitt. While some of the stuff he says is done well, other things sound out of place and forced. Jim's voice work is also very limited in that he only has one response for each action, and since he says some sort of remark after finding or accomplishing anything, things can get very repetitive. Reaching a checkpoint, finding a secret, grabbing a Treasure Planet Token, or doing any other number of things will evoke a response from Jim, but he says the same thing every time. After hearing him say \"Yeah! Checkpoint!\" for the thousandth time, you'll start searching for the mute button on your remote.  The one highlight in the game for me is the music. Most of it sounds something like an Irish folk tune, and it repeats quite quickly, but I found it to be pretty catchy in an odd and possibly scary way. It fits sort of along the same lines as the theme from It's a Small World at Disneyland in that it'll just drill into your head, but it's not as grating to the ears. ",

        "Content": "For a game with the words “rush” and “blood” in its title, this on-rails VR arcade shooter is sadly lacking in thrills. Based tangentially on characters and imagery from the 2015 interactive horror story from which it draws its name, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood fails to deliver anything new or remarkably exciting as a virtual reality experience, an arcade-style first-person shooter, or an Until Dawn spinoff. And yet, despite its relative blandness, there's something inviting about its cheesy brand of carnival-themed horror, casual arcade shooting, and gimmicky rollercoaster-based structure. While Rush of Blood is a pretty standard rail shooter, the ability to look around when you hear something creeping around behind you or see an enemy out of the corner of your eye makes the experience far more engaging in VR. Your field of play is effectively widened by the ability to quickly turn your head, so I was constantly scanning my environment — first out of caution, but eventually, when I realized Rush of Blood wasn’t going to be very scary, out of obligation. Baddies often pop into your peripheral, making it important to actively look around so you can start blasting away with your dual firearms before they get too close. The shooting mechanics are simple and easy to grasp with either a DualShock 4 or the Move controllers, and feel just as fun and responsive with both. You always have two firearms at any given time, which you can control independent of each other with the Move controllers. Using a DualShock 4 grants you less precise control by keeping the guns locked together, but doesn’t sacrifice too much in terms of ease of use. You can still use the motion controls to point them freely, but need to make use of the analog sticks to widen or narrow the gap between. Once your target’s lined up, it’s a simple pull of the triggers to shoot, and either the DualShock’s bumpers or the Move controller’s center Move button to reload. There's never a shortage of things to shoot. “ When it comes to targets, there's never a shortage of things to shoot, including inanimate filler objects to help keep your point multiplier going if you’re chasing a high score, as well as special collectibles that kept me hyper-aware of my environment at all times. One major collectible announces its presence with the distant sound of a baby wailing, and that’s one of the neat ways Rush of Blood uses sound to both build atmosphere and direct gameplay. Optional targets range in size from large crates to small vases and other objects, all conveniently marked with bullseyes. Some of the most satisfying moments in Rush of Blood came not from shooting away at waves of enemies, but quickly one-shotting every last optional target in a room. The flashlight beams that emit from both firearms act as laser sights that, in the absence of a crosshair, make sniping especially faraway objects possible in the darkness. None of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations. “ New weapon pickups are frequent and often placed before areas where you’ll need them most. They’re also easy to see in large, festively colored crates that stand out against the drab greys and browns of most levels, with an easily identifiable silhouette of the weapon type on the front. Shooting a crate flings that weapon only into the hand you shot it with, so you can have fun mixing it up: I often found myself going for the short-range firepower of a shotgun in one hand while keeping one pistol for the long-range accuracy. Weapon crates always come in pairs though, so the option to trade off both handguns for alternatives, like the more powerful but ammo-limited dual revolvers or the speedy dual machine pistols, is always there. Special weapons are temporary, but it’s easy to glance down at the dashboard on your rollercoaster train to see how much ammo you have left. Once depleted, they automatically switch back to the default handguns, but that never felt like a bad thing. The starter pistols are reliable enough thanks to their infinite ammo and quick reloading to use exclusively — that is, if you can keep up with the longer waves of enemies in later levels. Until Dawn: Rush of Blood starts out strong, especially once it hits its stride after the tutorial-heavy first level. You’re introduced to the rollercoaster structure by a circus ringleader-type played by the same actor who portrayed The Stranger in Until Dawn, but who I believe is meant to be a different character. Rush of Blood seems to take place in the mind of Josh, considering the frequent cameos from his twin sisters, so it would make sense for him to reappropriate people he’s met into new and strange roles. Not even this connection to the main game is very satisfying in terms of carrying on the Until Dawn story, though, and isn’t really necessary to enjoy the experience. Still, the invitation to take a ride on a hellbound rollercoaster is tempting, albeit cheesy, and the ringleader’s introductions to each of the seven total levels lent an admittedly lame, but flavorful sense of foreboding for what was to come. More PlayStation VR Launch Reviews  See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. Feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a walkthrough haunted house. “ Sadly, none of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations across the roughly two hours it takes to complete them all. Rush of Blood starts to show the most potential for scares in level two, a meandering tour of a slaughterhouse for giant pigs. After a few silent turns through a room full of oversized carcasses the killing machines sprung into action, filling my ears with the sound of whirring saw blades and shrieking pigs. This incredibly gory sequence then segues into an Until Dawn-inspired nightmare that presented some of the strongest imagery in the entire game. In one part, the rollercoaster train rolls down a steep drop into a pitch-black abyss and slows to a pace once it reaches a crowd of huge, naked, empty-eyed dolls representing Josh’s friends. One of the dolls has a camera, filming you as you ride on past, just as they did with his sister Hannah the night she disappeared. The scene embodies the chilling nature of what these people did to humiliate their friend very well, but ultimately serves as an unusually eerie and bizarre high in a ride full of bland, boring lows. After level two the environments get less and less interesting, blurring together into the same boring combination of rickety buildings and musty caves with equally uninspired enemy designs. You’ll fight evil clowns, annoying crows, giant spiders, and the dull, zombie-like wendigos recognizable from the main game. Sometimes, you can change things up by shooting railroad switches that pop up occasionally in most levels to change tracks and explore hidden side-passages full of targets, collectibles, and a much-needed change of scenery if you’re on a second or third playthrough. Despite its blandness, it's still a decently fun ride. “ No matter how many detours you take though, it always culminates in an unremarkable final bossfight against an incredibly stupid-looking monster that seems out of place in something related to Until Dawn. I was drawn in far more by the use of 3D sounds in each level, which built an uncomfortable atmosphere while having the practical effect of alerting me to nearby threats. But as a result, jump scares are telegraphed way too often and the horror almost completely evaporates. After I realized how tame Rush of Blood’s scares were going to be it took a lot of the edge off, and the experience suffered. Long stretches of inaction serve as a breather from the mostly wave-based combat, and a way to rest your arms from the inevitable fatigue caused by the motion controls, but happen a bit more frequently than I would’ve liked — a problem in levels that last only about five to 15 minutes. More often than not, Rush of Blood feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a slow walkthrough haunted house, and it’s about as scary too.",

        "Subheader": "By Mikel Reparaz Updated: Aug 16, 2021 11:58 pm Posted: Jul 21, 2014 6:35 pm",
        "Content": "As beloved as it is, certain aspects of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee have aged about as well as a wet mummy. Clunky controls, unadjustable harsh difficulty, and graphics that are hideous when scaled up to HD resolutions mean high barriers to entry for newcomers, which make it harder to discover one of the most memorably imaginative games of the late '90s. Thankfully, it's a lot easier in Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. Rebuilding Oddysee from scratch, New 'n' Tasty modernizes the original's gameplay and art while leaving its level layout and design largely untouched. The end result is a smoother, more vivid, and much more immediately fun retelling of the excellent first Oddworld story. 50 Images  A brilliantly weird side-scrolling adventure, New 'n' Tasty focuses on Abe, a puny, bumbling alien out to escape the sinister factory farm where he and his fellow Mudokons are enslaved. Because Abe is relatively defenseless and weak, this involves dodging a lot of spinning blades and explosive traps (something that requires careful timing and observation), sneaking past threats, and – if there's no security hardware nearby to prevent it – mind-controlling guards. That last one is cathartically violent, letting you remotely walk your enemies into mines, or wipe out their friends (or your friends, if you're feeling mean) with gunfire before making your host explode in gruesome chunks.  Getting through the assorted hazards is tough enough on its own, but you also have a secondary task to consider: rescuing other Mudokons by leading them safely past danger and into magical portals. You're free to ignore them and simply blast through the central challenges, in which case you'll get a shorter experience and a downer ending. Alternatively you can work to save them all, which involves discovering and exploring a lot of trap-filled secret rooms, which is a lot more rewarding. (Pure speed runs are also encouraged).  In either case, leading them to freedom is a lot less frustrating than it used to be, now that you can command groups of them to follow you – and sneak, run, or hide – at once. That's just one of the changes New 'n' Tasty makes; levels are now seamlessly scrolling environments, giving them a more open, cohesive feel than Oddysee's single-screen puzzle rooms. You can now aim thrown objects with the right analog stick instead of simply tapping a button and hoping they find their targets, and Abe has a new, endless supply of bottlecaps you can toss around to briefly distract enemies and kill annoying bats. And while Abe still has a noticeable weight and momentum that make jumping or rolling between tightly spaced traps an imprecise bastard, the controls for doing so are a lot more responsive.  The biggest change – and possibly the most controversial – is \"Quiksave,\" which lets you instantly save your location and progress just by tapping the Dual Shock 4's touchpad, and reload by holding it down. This doesn't quite eliminate frustration – you'll probably still die pretty frequently – but it cuts down on it immensely, as you can now save just before trying something risky, or after each stage of a particularly tough challenge. I found it indispensable – hey, not everyone likes retracing all their steps from the last checkpoint when every mistake brings instant death – but it's easy to see hardcore fans crying foul, especially since there isn't a way to turn Quiksave off.  Couple that with rebalanced checkpoints, a gentler difficulty curve, and new camera angles (which reveal threats in advance and offer more visual clues about secret areas), and New 'n Tasty simply isn't as tough as the original, even on hard difficulty. However, the point here isn't so much to provide a brutal challenge as an enjoyable one – and New 'n' Tasty is definitely enjoyable. Its re-imaginings of RuptureFarms and the surrounding wilderness are hugely fun to puzzle through, delivering a continual stream of diverse new challenges, and certain sequences – like charging across cliffs on the back of Abe's hooting Elum, or rolling a giant spiked ball into a swarm of spidery Paramites – are much more exhilarating now that the scenery actually scrolls.  It all looks amazing, too. Everything, from Abe's giant talking head on the title screen, to the suspiciously helpful signs posted throughout the backgrounds, has been lavishly redrawn and re-animated, giving Oddworld a new, more vibrant appearance. And it's accompanied by a wealth of newly recorded dialogue for Abe, his fellow Mudokons, and the creepy Slig guards, giving them even more personality than they had before. This is a top-flight production, and while it would have been nice to see a few more additions – like, say, an actual co-op mode instead of an alternating two-player option that’s misleadingly labeled as co-op – New 'n' Tasty is a fine return to form for a wonderfully strange classic.",

        "Subheader": "By Colin Moriarty Posted: Apr 25, 2014 5:51 pm",
        "Content": "Mercenary Kings -- a fun side-scrolling, old-school shooter -- pays reverence to many corners of gaming's past without being half-baked or derivative. For as much as I love the grittiness of a modern first-person shooter, the frights of a contemporary survival-horror adventure, or getting lost in the sprawling open-world map of a western RPG, I have a soft spot for old-school-inspired games that look dated, yet feel at home in today's gaming landscape, that pay homage to the past while staying relevant in the present. Mercenary Kings is one such game. SNK's storied Metal Slug franchise is probably Mercenary Kings' single biggest inspiration both aesthetically and in terms of gameplay, though there are shades of Monster Hunter, Contra, Mega Man, and much more here, too. The Monster Hunter association is most important, however, simply because Mercenary Kings isn't just a linear shooter, but a mission-based one rife with tons of loot drops that, in turn, can be used to craft stronger gear. The loot system is Mercenary Kings' greatest draw, and the focus of its identity. For as fun as it is to play, Mercenary Kings' addictive quality comes from the never-ending need to collect and synthesize. That's not only uncommon in side-scrolling shooters; it's virtually unheard of. Running through its 100+ levels, killing tons of enemies, and gathering what they leave behind is essential if you want to survive, and with a jaw-dropping amount of weapons, components, armor, and much more to create and equip, there's no shortage of reasons to stay engaged. It's a game that's almost impossible to rush through. Thankfully, getting into the nitty-gritty of Mercenary Kings' impressive equipment system doesn't mean you have to play a subpar, boring, or ill-executed shooter. Quite the opposite, in fact. Running and gunning through various environments -- abandoned caves, sprawling complexes, sewer systems, and more -- is a lot of fun, especially when you begin to learn its nuanced controls. Its active reload-style gunplay -- ripped straight out of the likes of Gears of War -- means that you have to be thoughtful during firefights. You can't reload constantly and expect to have any success. Likewise, enemies tend to do an inordinate amount of damage. All of this creates a sort of digital ballet, a careful dance of crisscrossing bullets, artful rolls and dodges, and tons of pixelated blood. Speaking of pixelated blood, I adore the way Mercenary Kings looks and sounds. Games using pixel art are a dime a dozen today, but Mercenary Kings has style. Character designs are unique and appealing; your base camp is littered with memorable characters, and the game's bad guys are archetypal, yet charming. There are a ton of enemies to do battle with, too, from gun-and-knife-wielding humans to robots to beasts and more, though there's a fair bit of palette-swapping to be found. As for the soundtrack, let's just say this: it's one of the best gaming soundtracks I've heard in years. Track-in and track-out, I was stunned by Mercenary Kings' attention to audio quality and fidelity. I just wish its long-winded story was more interesting. I found myself skipping every cutscene after only an hour of play, just so I could get back into the action.  While I'm making wishes, I wish Mercenary Kings had tighter controls. For the most part, everything works as you'd expect, but there are certain issues that stand out. Pressing down to shoot from your belly doesn't always work, jumping can be finicky, and occasional split-second freezes interrupted my flow. But part of conquering the 20-plus hour campaign is in overcoming certain perceived deficiencies. It's weird to say, but in this respect, it has that true old-school spirit. It's like playing Castlevania with its crazy midair collision kickback, or Dragon Warrior with its random, out-of-left-field ass-kicking enemies. This is what Mercenary Kings is ; figuring out how to work within its rules is part of the fun. Mercenary Kings' more modern elements come from its rank-based play, sprawling maps, and online components. Stages are unlocked one rank at a time, and groups of stages must be completed to move on to the next group. Missions will take place on many of the same maps -- and I definitely wish there was a greater variety of locations -- but your tasks on each map, and the time you're given to get through each mission, will vary significantly. On one map, you may be given 30 minutes to rescue 16 hostages from every corner of a complex. But you may go back to that same complex with a focus on a particular section of it, with 10 minutes to clear a certain amount of enemies. If you want to play with your friends, you can absolutely do that, whether locally or online. Mercenary Kings allows for up to four people to play at once. Local play isn't ideal because it cuts the screen up, but online play is a great way to ease Mercenary Kings' grueling difficulty if it starts to cramp your style. Then again, I played the entire campaign by myself, so it's by no means necessary.",

        "Subheader": "By Leif Johnson Posted: Jul 22, 2014 7:08 pm",
        "Content": "If you'd spoken with me about Magic: The Gathering six months ago, I'd have told you that I expected 2015 to be the year that the Duels of the Planeswalkers games would lay down their winning hand. The circumstances couldn't be better. The series has had five years now to perfect its gameplay and options, and the success of Blizzard's Hearthstone has introduced an enthusiastic new generation to the addictiveness of collectible card games. And yet… this is what we get. Developer Stainless Games may have finally introduced some form of the open deck-building players have clamored for since 2009, but it's smothered under a bland presentation, a shocking lack of expected features, and one of the saddest cases of tripping over its own  microtransactions this side of last year's Dungeon Keeper . 30 Images A silver lining of Magic 2015’s depressing cloud is that its disappointments never entirely shatter the basic appeal. The tutorial is as helpful as ever, competently introducing new players to its language of using \"land\" cards for resources for abilities, buffs, and summons along with some introduction to the time-tested feats of strategy needed to whittle away your opponent's 20 health points. It explains the strengths of the five colored decks well enough, so a newcomer could at least jump into the main campaign knowing that white decks are all about healing and angels and green decks place a heavy emphasis on conjuring beasties to aid you in battle. Yet problems pop up immediately, such as the fiddly interface that's clearly designed specifically for the tablet version that came out a week before. It relies heavily on swiping back and forth through menus and options. While that's at least understandable (if not exactly efficient) on an iPad, on the PC it keeps essential options, such as manual land selection and simple graphics tweaks, stuffed behind overlong transitions. All of that drags actions that should take 10 seconds into half a minute of drudgery. Duels games have always suffered from minor interface inconveniences, but just getting around in Magic 2015 sometimes seems to take as much mental effort as the puzzle matches of Duels past, with none of the payoff. Adding insult to injury,  those enjoyable puzzle modes  are strangely missing in this year’s version. But at least we can start craft our own decks for the first time, right? Yes, but oddly enough, the implementation of a feature I thought I wanted marks a major step back for Planeswalkers’ potential for fun. Deciding which kind of deck you liked to play with used to be a issue of fighting themed bosses and winning their deck for your own use, which ensured you knew how to use it. Didn't like it? You could just abandon it and switch it out for another one you won off a different boss. (It's worth noting that Hearthstone works this way.) In Magic 2015, you're stuck with the deck you used to win the tutorial until you can grind it into something useful. That deck is always a hybrid consisting of two colors, which on the surface marks an improvement over the single-colored decks of some of the previous games. But let's say you only settled on that deck because it worked especially well against the tutorial boss. There’s nothing you can do about it now, and Magic 2015 compounds the frustration by only rewarding you with new cards as you battle through the short, boring campaign. My experience with these rewards hasn’t been good — usually they make weak additions to my deck, and just as often they're worthless duplicates. The pace of progress is a slog. Thus, from here on out you're expected to grind, most notably through a new Explore mode that sends you into battle against a sea of random decks.  Because of the poor rewards, I felt compelled to pay beyond the initial $10 buy-in to get the most out of Magic 2015, by which I mean to have a chance in multiplayer. The option to purchase themed decks was available in the past, but here the sale of cards from each arc of the campaign feels more like a necessity in light of the grind that awaits—a decision which makes some sick sense in light of the iOS version's blank price tag. (Why even bother, then, with a cover price on Steam?) Hours of grinding still won't net you the 10 best cards, however, which are only available through premium booster packs that run for $1.99 a pop. Microtransactions aside, it's a shame that the 2015 version of this once-proud game feels best defined by what it lacks. The questions fly by like bullets to anyone who's played the series before. Where are the revenge matches, the Two-Headed Giant cooperative mode, the Archenemy multiplayer mode? They have passed like rain on the mountain, apparently. It’s also a dreary-looking game. Magic: The Gathering has the kind of artwork that could keep me entranced for hours, but the playing field here is a bland affair that looks like a white sliding door from the U.S.S. Enterprise turned on its side. The colored and detailed boards of the past suited the artwork better; consider, for instance, the crimson layering of Magic 2012 or the deep blue field of play from last year's incarnation. Here the cards, seemingly tinier than in years past, get lost in the achromatic sea. The best thing I can say about the situation is that somehow the old satisfaction of making a comeback when you only have two health points left still manages to shine through in all this mess, particularly in the multiplayer matches for three or four players. It's the kind of game that might hold some attraction if received as a gift, but if you're looking to jump into the video game versions of Magic yourself, you're better off looking at a more consistently enjoyable Duels game like Magic 2013. Or better yet, just stick with Hearthstone. Hey, Wizards of the Coast—whatever happened to the magic, man?",
