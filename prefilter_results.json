        "Content": "Editor's Note: This review takes a fresh look at Stardew Valley after its 1.6 update on PC, replacing our previous review from 2018 . You can read more about our review policies and philosophy here . Every time I return to Stardew Valley after a new patch drops, I ask myself: why is the pull still so strong? Newer farming games have improved on many of the mechanics its developer, ConcernedApe, introduced way back in 2016, adding interesting twists to the old-school blueprint it repopularized \u2013 so in 2024, why is Stardew Valley still my favorite? But that\u2019s just it: Stardew Valley is the model for farming games now. It may not be quite as refined or as streamlined as some of the sims it inspired, but none have managed to capture the raw lightning in a bottle that makes it so enduring, either. That\u2019s partly because Stardew Valley might be a \u201ccozy\u201d pixel art haven, but it\u2019s also tough . Managing your time and juggling dozens of competing priorities is an endless challenge, and it\u2019s in this superbly balanced dance that I find an intense satisfaction that simply cannot be beat. Pair that with a nearly decade-long parade of new quirky details to discover every time I start up a fresh farm, and Stardew Valley becomes truly timeless.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There is no small measure of irony to the fact that the start of Stardew Valley plucks you from a soul-crushing desk job and plops you into a quaint little farming town\u2026 where you must then become a tireless, people-pleasing perfectionist. Oh, you thought you were just going to be pleasantly plucking weeds and planting parsnips on your late grandpa\u2019s abandoned farm? No, you aren\u2019t just a farmer after your move to Pelican Town. Like any typical entry-level intern, you are expected to wear many hats. Restoring the Community Center to its former glory may be fulfilling labor, but you\u2019ll also need to level up your skills across the board, from foraging to fishing to mining, and even monster fighting. Don\u2019t forget to smoodge your way into the hearts of the lovable townspeople by showering them with gifts every day. How else are you supposed to find your life partner? Multitasking efficiently is a deceptively tense balancing act. \u201c I\u2019m a returning fan, so I know what I want to accomplish on each new run, but for those new to this sensation you might find that, at first, Stardew Valley gives you so much freedom and so many options that it can feel kind of aimless. Besides the odd request from your neighbors arriving in the mail, you are given no larger objective \u2013 just this broad rags-to-riches goal of fixing up your grandpa\u2019s farm and the town by delivering bundles of goods. It\u2019s only as you start to progress through the seasons that you realize what\u2019s at stake. Sure, you could play at your own leisure and still find plenty of joy in a more relaxed, unoptimized pace. But you\u2019ll soon come to understand that forgetting to gift Jodi that cauliflower she wanted in spring could mean waiting a whole year before you get back to the season where you can grow that crop again, and thus learn to make time for the things that matter most. Stardew Valley Gameplay Screenshots - 1.6 Update 72 Images This makes Stardew Valley a deceptively tense balancing act of managing your time and multitasking efficiently. There are plenty of things to unlock that will make that easier, be they cooking recipes for meals that increase your stamina so you can accomplish more each day or upgraded tools to help you till the earth and water your crops quicker. But the cost of unlocking those things usually comes in the form of grinding for experience points in the skill you are trying to improve or collecting a certain number of required items. Do you want to unlock the greenhouse before the end of Year 1? Well, then you\u2019d better make sure you grow enough gold-quality melons that summer to complete the Pantry Bundle in the Community Center , otherwise you\u2019ll have to wait until Year 2. This is why playing Stardew Valley alongside a good game guide can be day and night. Like many \u201cold-school\u201d games, Stardew Valley doesn\u2019t always tell you everything you need to know. Not every quest has hints to follow, and when it comes to finding some seasonal items such as specific fish, you\u2019re going in completely blind. There\u2019s definitely joy to be found in figuring something out for yourself, but I only found myself truly thriving once I realized that there was an endless dirge of strategy guides and community resources to be found online. You\u2019re always incentivized to explore areas you might not otherwise. \u201c While this might sound like an overly rigid slog, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like one. Seasons are so fleeting and the time you have to accomplish your goals is so limited that you\u2019re always incentivized to explore areas you might not have otherwise in order to accomplish them quicker. For example, if you want to unlock the minecarts (a handy mode of fast travel), you\u2019ll need to push yourself to explore the mines. Each floor is randomly generated, and breaking open rocks to find materials while cutting down slimes and other monsters quickly evolves into a harrowing dungeon crawl. As you delve deeper, you will encounter dangerous and strange new enemies with different attacks and harder hits, and it\u2019s fun to prepare the right weapons and stat-boosting food to survive. Lose all your health (or run out of energy and fail to make it home in time) and you\u2019ll pass out, costing you cash or even your precious treasure depending on which character randomly finds you and brings you back to the surface, making each trip down into the mines feel fresh and potentially nerve-racking. What's your favorite thing to do in Stardew Valley? Farming/raising animals Fishing Combat/mining Making friends/dating Completing bundles/quests Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results If combat isn\u2019t your speed, there are so many other things to do that you could easily put off exploring the mines for a bit in favor of farming, foraging, or even socializing \u2013 and don\u2019t even get me started on fishing. (Okay, if you insist!) Stardew Valley\u2019s infamous fishing minigame is both the bane of my existence and my greatest obsession. It\u2019s such a simple activity: cast in your line, snag a fish, and then keep a green bar overlapped with a bouncing fish icon until you\u2019ve successfully reeled it in. And yet, nothing is more devastating than carefully tapping my left mouse button for a whole minute to keep a Pufferfish on the line, only to break concentration for a moment and watch my progress crash into the red. On the other hand, nothing is quite as elating as finally catching an elusive Catfish on a rainy day. Every fish has different behaviors and movement patterns that dictate how they wiggle around on the hook, adding an interesting layer of strategy to recognizing them; some are easier to predict and others will have you on the verge of frustrated tears. It is quite literally my favorite activity. The joy of Stardew Valley isn\u2019t just in making the most of its jam-packed days, it\u2019s in all the little quirks and secrets you discover along the way. From heartwarming cutscenes with villagers to bizarre one-off quests that could have you delivering maple syrup to a strangely cognizant bear, truly, so much character has been injected into this idyllic town. This is the only game where I can build a pond on my farm only to then get absurd demands from the talking fish within it. What is a fish going to do with three Omni Geodes anyway? Time to go mining in the Skull Cavern, I guess. Fast days entice you to stick around for \u201cjust one more.\" \u201c You\u2019re rarely doing the same thing for very long because it takes less than 15 minutes to play through an in-game day, a pace which only further entices me to stick around for \u201cjust one more\u201d every session. Because time is so tight, it often feels like you never quite have enough to do everything you might want to \u2013 that may sound frustrating initially, but it\u2019s actually so absorbing. It forces you to strategize and plan out your tasks in advance, fueling that obsessive urge to keep playing even more in order to keep from leaving some goal only half finished. In this way, each morning feels like embarking on a new dungeon run. How far will you get today? Will luck be on your side or will it work against you? Stardew Valley feels endless, which is both thrilling and overwhelming. Yes, technically, there are two ways in which you could see yourself \u201cbeating\u201d it. The first is to fully restore the Community Center by gifting the adorable little Junimo spirits specific bundles of local goodies, which you either have to grow or hunt down yourself, and the second is to achieve total \u201cPerfection,\u201d Stardew Valley\u2019s version of 100% completion. Either one will have you planting vegetables, growing fruit trees, and raising animals on your farm, all of which follow suit with Stardew Valley as a whole by being fairly straightforward on the surface, but deviously deep if you want to maximize both the quantity and quality of your produce. It will likely take you more than one in-game year just to complete the Community Center on your first playthrough; with 28 days in each of the four seasons, that means this challenge alone can easily take dozens of hours, and I loved every minute of it. Hearing about that scale of time commitment could make it seem like an intimidating task, but this is the true appeal of Stardew Valley: It is a collector\u2019s paradise. Just when you think you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll stumble upon another list of tasks to delightfully check off. Complete the Community Center bundles and now the local fisherman, Willy, is asking you to help repair his old boat. Next thing you know, you\u2019re traveling to a totally new island that\u2019s mostly inhabited by voracious parrots. Of course, the only way to explore this entirely separate area and unlock all the cool things introduced there is by feeding the parrots the Golden Walnuts found hidden throughout the island . It gives you another enticing goal to distract you from whatever you may have been doing before, even if just for a few days. It could easily take over 100 hours to discover everything it has to offer. \u201c This deluge of options is in no small part thanks to all of the excellent free updates Stardew Valley has sporadically received since its initial launch in 2016, tantalizingly pushing that finish line further and further out of reach for its dedicated players. ConcernedApe has added co-op multiplayer, cool new starting farm layouts, tons of additional crops and seasonal events, expanded post-game activities, and innumerable bug fixes \u2013 not to mention plenty of silly things like the recent craze sweeping the valley: drinking mayonnaise. I\u2019ve lost count of how many farms I\u2019ve started over the years, including one on the unique new Meadowlands Farm layout that was introduced in the most recent 1.6 update (only on PC as of this writing) and I still haven\u2019t found those darn raccoons it added! It could quite literally take you over 100 hours to discover everything Stardew Valley has to offer\u2026 and by the time you do, there may have been another patch. And did I mention the lore scattered throughout it all? Because, yes, Stardew Valley is steeped in the stuff. At first, the people of Pelican Town might come off as stand-offish and sometimes even cold. But the more you chat with each villager and give gifts to increase your \u201cfriendship\u201d level with them, the more you will unveil just how messy these people are. The kind but strangely vain mayor has a secret lover; we\u2019re all pretty sure that Abigail, our resident video-game loving goth girl, has a mysterious origin story to discover. Heck, you don\u2019t even get to meet one of the villagers until you\u2019ve reached Year 2 because he\u2019s been away fighting in a war against some fantastical evil empire. I love getting to feel like the town snoop, prying into the personal details of everybody\u2019s lives without any of the repercussions. If anything, the messiness of these characters makes them feel more grounded and endearing. Shailyn's Favorite Farming Games My favorite farming sims and farm-adjacent games!

There are 12 eligible villagers residing in Pelican Town , all of whom you can get to know by chatting them up once a day and gifting their favorite things. This is one area where Stardew can, admittedly, fall a bit flat relative to the high points of other games with a focus on dating. While it\u2019s great that you can date any of these villagers regardless of gender, it doesn\u2019t quite make up for the lack of both interesting personalities and diversity amongst your choices for romantic partners. If there\u2019s romance available in a game, I want to feel torn by the decision of who to pursue. But here, my indecision over who to marry initially has less to do with being too smitten and more to do with the fact that all of the options are similarly\u2026 unappealing. That being said, I don\u2019t think all of the villagers of Stardew Valley are necessarily supposed to be immediately \u201clikable\u201d in a traditional sense. Just as it often is in real life, it\u2019s only after taking the time to get to know them through special conversations and unlockable events that some of them start to look more attractive and complex as people. But while their larger stories are generally well written, they don\u2019t necessarily make for the most exciting romantic partners to woo right out of the gate.

Not only does this standout sequel manage to masterfully imagine what a massive, big-budget RPG might look like in VR, it astonishingly reinvents itself several times throughout its 90+ hour runtime, making those hours absolutely fly by. The four playable characters are extraordinarily different from each other and mastering them all is a blast, the deep RPG mechanics and loads of secrets to discover make the temptation to keep the headset on for just another half hour or two a seriously troubling habit, and the combat, exploration, and puzzles make every new dungeon an action-packed, deeply satisfying adventure that easily surpasses almost everything that\u2019s previously been accomplished in virtual reality. The fact that there\u2019s also an excellent roguelite mode one could easily lose dozens of hours in, and that\u2019s just casually thrown in as an optional activity for the heck of it, is just mind-boggling. Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 is the kind of landmark game-changer that only comes around once in a blue moon, and in a year already jam-packed with extremely good games, this is easily one of my favorites. What we said about Asgard's Wrath Asgard\u2019s Wrath is a fantastic action-adventure RPG that can stand with the best of them on consoles and PC, but the fact that it\u2019s meticulously crafted for VR means it sits in a league of its own. Asgard\u2019s Wrath represents something VR enthusiasts have been waiting for for years now: the first absolute must-play virtual reality game that feels fully fleshed-out rather than a glorified tech demo. Its beautiful world, excellent combat, great interface, and straightforward but detailed story come together to form something spectacular. - Gabriel Moss, October 10, 2019 Score: 9.4 Read our full Asgard's Wrath review . This is a game that takes all the most important parts of your Skyrims and your Legends of Zelda and reimagines them for virtual reality from the ground up with amazing success. Playing as a god who possesses mortals to help them fulfill their destinies, you\u2019ll roam interesting open-world areas from vast deserts to spooky planes of the afterlife, navigate treacherous dungeons, loot chests, recharge and socialize back at the hideout with the NPCs you befriend along the way, and even kick back with a fishing rod, \u2018cause why the heck not? It's true that Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 might not look or perform as well as games running on high-end hardware, but it more than makes up for that deficit with its innovative ideas and incredibly fun gameplay, and pushes the limits on what\u2019s possible on its native device. In other words, this is the Tears of the Kingdom of the Meta Quest 3 . It transcends hardware limitations by just crushing it in every other area. This sequel improves and expands upon just about everything. \u201c Building upon the many successes of its extremely good and still worth-playing predecessor, this superb sequel improves and expands upon just about everything, from combat and exploration to the significantly more fleshed out animal companions who accompany you on your journey. Solving puzzles and fighting massive bosses in dungeons hits all the same highs as old-school, 3D adventures with Link; running around the open world might not go nearly as deep as, say, a classic Bethesda RPG, but it\u2019s above and beyond anything we\u2019ve seen in VR to date at the same rough level as something like The Outer Worlds in offering tons of reasons to go off the beaten path and explore to your heart\u2019s content. You never know when you might find a sewer level hidden underneath a small crack in a mountain or a terrifying optional boss lurking within an out-of-the-way cave, and that makes every minute of exploration absolutely worth it. The story picks up where the last game left off, with you controlling a God with the ability to possess and empower mortals who was left in a cell to rot after being very predictably betrayed by the famously untrustworthy God of Mischief: Loki. If you didn\u2019t play the first one, you won\u2019t catch some of the references to those characters and events, but that backstory isn\u2019t really necessary to understand and enjoy the drama here. Thankfully, there\u2019s a really strong recap to catch you up, but all you really need to know is that Loki\u2019s not a very nice guy and you really hate him. After being plucked from your prison by a higher power, you\u2019re sent on a seemingly unrelated quest to Egypt while you wait for your opportunity to get revenge on the Norse trickster. Asgard's Wrath 2 - Gameplay Screenshots (Meta Quest 3) 62 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The good news is the decision to move away from the now-overused Norse mythology into the Egyptian pantheon is a smart one that gives us a nice change of pace as well as a fresh set of faces to become besties with, along with some new sights to see outside of frozen mountains and stone halls. That redirected focus means little progress is made in telling the overarching story, which I didn\u2019t consider a bad thing since I was more invested in the loveable cast and sandy pyramids of Egypt anyway. I quite enjoyed hanging out with the likes of Castor, the heroic jock who helped me craft traps and bait, and Horus, the orphaned god who\u2019s down on his luck and severely in need of a friend. More importantly, the four self-contained stories told through each of the playable characters had more of my attention anyway, serving as bite-sized tales that carried the moment-to-moment drama while the larger cosmic conflict loomed in the background. Most surprisingly of all is just how much content there is! VR games have a well-earned reputation as being generally short and sweet, but Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 defies expectations. Though I tried to complete most side quests and kept an eye on all the chests placed just out of reach in the open world, I didn\u2019t even approach a completionist run and still found myself sinking in an astonishing 91 hours before I rolled credits. You might decide to take a break from the main quest to partake in a slingshot shooting gallery or a pinball-like minigame while at the hideout, or stumble onto a quest where you possess a monkey in a completely optional story tangent, or craft special bait to lure a giant scorpion out of hiding to duel you to the death. This isn\u2019t an RPG that cuts any corners or feels limited by VR. \u201c You\u2019ll also find random encounters while exploring where rifts in reality pull you into a pocket dimension to complete a mini objective, like engaging in some puzzle-platforming while avoiding traps or fighting off some goons. Some of these even have fun mixed-reality components where you\u2019ll find yourself back in your real home fighting off evil minions through portals ripped in your living room (a nice use of the Quest 3\u2019s AR capabilities that won\u2019t show up if you\u2019re on older hardware). I don\u2019t know what dark alchemy developer Sanzaru Games concocted to get this massive RPG to work on the completely wireless Quest 3 (unlike the first one, there is no PC version to tether to), but this isn\u2019t an RPG that cuts any corners or feels limited (at least in its scope) by the VR medium. Quite the opposite: it leans into that immersion and never stops giving your reasons to spend time living in it. There\u2019s even a social element where you can leave a projection of your avatar out in the world to help give others hints or simply dance for no reason, just to make sure you don\u2019t get lonely out there among the fires of Muspelheim. Which mythology should Asgard\u2019s Wrath explore next? Chinese Greek Arthurian Aztec Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results Of course, helping a quartet of mortals fulfill their destinies is bound to involve lots of fighting, and Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 knocks it out of the park here too. While the first entry\u2019s combat was great, it primarily focused on melee, and forced you to play defensively and whittle down opposing shields before pressing the attack. But in the sequel, you\u2019re given a whole lot more freedom. Now you can go on the offensive to remove enemy shields, play it safe with ranged attacks, yank flying enemies to the ground with your whip, or use special abilities to do fancy things like charge at one of the magnificently toned humanoid lizards to knock it flat on its back. Combat also benefits from the fact that enemy AI is surprisingly crafty, and will grow wise to your tricks if you lean too heavily on any one tactic. For example, if you insist on repeatedly throwing your ranged weapon at one of the oddly alluring crocodile people they won\u2019t let that slide for long, and suddenly you\u2019ll see them catch your weapon in their muscular hands before lobbing it right back in your face. That means you won\u2019t be able to just spam your way through encounters, encouraging you to engage with all the tools available to you on whichever hero you\u2019re using and think quick on your feet. When that all came together I felt like a complete badass, pulling off chains like striking down one enemy with my sword before shooting an arrow at another across the room, then swatting an enemy projectile back in the face of a third chiseled reptile, all without taking a hit \u2013 there\u2019s really no better way to experience that than in VR. There\u2019s quite a bit of challenge for those who would seek it. \u201c If there\u2019s one area for improvement when it comes to combat, it\u2019s definitely in the enemy variety. I quite enjoyed doing battle with the surprisingly attractive bipedal crocodiles that make up the vast majority of combatants in the first half of the adventure, but you\u2019ll definitely be seeing quite a lot of them. Even if those scaly Adonises did awaken a part of me I didn\u2019t know existed, it takes quite a bit of time before you start seeing the mummies, snakes, parasitic bugs, and not-as-sexy regular crocodiles that fill the rest of your bestiary. Likewise, there are a couple repeated minibosses every now and again that didn\u2019t feel entirely necessary, like the three times I fought a big cat-serpent monster. And if you\u2019re into challenging combat like yours truly, you\u2019re in luck, because as someone who played the entire odyssey on the hardest difficulty, I can attest that there\u2019s quite a bit of challenge for those who would seek it. I died more than my fair share of times at the hands of my beloved lizard folk, who relentlessly surround you and work together to ensnare you with melee and ranged attacks that will gut unwary adventurers in no time flat. Boss fights are, sadly, the exception here: rather than putting your skills to the test, they mostly serve the role of rewarding you with a power fantasy finale to each act (still, those are all really cool). TieGuyTravis' Favorite VR Games See All 1 Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 Sanzaru Games 2 Half-Life: Alyx Valve 3 Asgard\u2019s Wrath Sanzaru Games 4 Synapse nDreams 5 Beat Saber Hyperbolic Magnetism 6 Pistol Whip Cloudhead Games 7 I Expect You to Die Schell Games 8 Demeo Resolution Games 9 Trover Saves the Universe Squanch Games 10 Superhot VR Superhot Team One of the most impressive things Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 manages to fit into its enormous adventure is its four playable protagonists, each with their own weapons, abilities, storylines, and open-world map to let them loose on. You learn the ropes as Abraxas, a traditional sword-and-shield warrior who serves as an approachable starting point, but then you\u2019ll find yourself controlling increasingly more outlandish mortals until suddenly you\u2019re throwing your own decapitated head at your foes to possess them. One of the more inspired heroes, Cyrene, is a river naiad with an affinity for aquatic life, so all of her weapons are living sea creatures, like a hilarious octopus harp that pulls double duty as a musical instrument and a bow to deal damage at a distance, and a lovable eel that wraps around her arm so its tongue can be used as a melee weapon. Each playstyle is such a departure from the last that finishing one saga and unlocking the next character feels like diving into a completely different game, which does wonders to extend the shelf life in an adventure that already would feel massive with just the first character \u2013 especially by the standards of virtual reality. Even the more mundane characters are still interesting and feel great to play, owing to an abundance of neat mechanics that help you solve puzzles and defeat bosses. For example, Abraxas might seem like a standard melee character at first, but by the end of his adventure you\u2019ll have a whole bag of cool tricks like turning your sword into a whip to yank yourself toward enemies and across gaps, and a throwing ax that can change direction mid-flight to activate hidden buttons or swat baddies from around corners like you\u2019re an Egyptian Force-user. Even after dozens of hours, it kept introducing new ideas. \u201c Later, when I found myself controlling a hero with no shield and minimal melee options, I had to reconfigure my entire brain around ranged gameplay and a whole new set of abilities, like a squid turret I could toss out to lay down suppressing fire, or a throwable mine that could be shot with a bow to send my enemies to the afterlife with a fiery explosion. Even after dozens of hours, when I finally unlocked the final character, they kept introducing new ideas, like prayer beads that can be used as either a shield, a whip, or to create portals to aid in puzzle solving. Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 just never ran out of fantastic ideas right up until the credits, and I can\u2019t remember the last time an RPG was this good at keeping me on my toes. That variety and depth with each character extends into the incredibly dense including skill trees for each hero, which unlock tons of buffs and meaningful special abilities that add some more interesting ways to use your equipment. One skill lets the your elf archer character Alvida turn her mines into turrets when she shoots an arrow at them; another that lets Abraxas toss his shield, then whip it to turn it into a deadly pinball that bounces around the level. Then there\u2019s the usual stuff like crafting, which lets you build better versions of your weapons and armor for you and your companions, including upgrades that add slots for elemental runes or grant bonus effects (and just plain look cooler), as well as potions that can be brewed, food that can be cooked, and traps that can be devised to use in battle. They give you a whole lot of reasons to gather coins and crafting materials, and in all my time hanging out in Egypt and beyond, I never once found myself in a situation where I was not in dire need of one material or another. It\u2019s also impressive just how good the puzzles are, owing to the way they challenge you to make use of each of the heroes\u2019 unique arsenal as well as your companions\u2019 abilities to get through each area. You\u2019ll find clever sections where you have to throw Abraxas\u2019 ax onto a button, then use its redirecting ability to slide it in the right direction, or use Cyrene\u2019s harp octopus to play a musical tune to a sea creature to guide it over to a flower to grow a vine you can climb. Other areas were less about being smart and more about using my reflexes and the specific abilities of my hero to platform through dangerous, trap-filled areas and narrowly avoid death. Shockingly all that yanking myself across gaps with a whip and wall running past swinging death traps gave me absolutely no motion sickness and made me feel like the badass god I was playing as. The best puzzles though, combine your mortal and your godly forms by allowing you to toggle back and forth between them. As a giant being you can manipulate the world around you, then jump back into your puny mortal form to get through the area. In one such memorable level, I helped Abraxas get around an otherwise-unnavigable shipwreck by simply picking up and moving pieces of its shattered hull so he could wall run on them to the next area. Those sections especially managed to keep me on toes with creative stuff like that right up until the end, and that\u2019s no small feat. There are half as many companions, but each is far more fleshed out. \u201c Another area this sequel improves upon the original is with its animal companions, who accompany you in your travels and each have a unique ability to help with puzzle solving. Subira, a panther turned humanoid, is a combat-focused helper who can make ghostly objects appear and disappear within the world, while Pa-ahket is a support-focused bird who can make certain platforms float in the air. Unlike the original Asgard\u2019s Wrath, this time each follower has their own backstory and social links that reward building relationships with your bestial comrades, encouraging you to talk to them, give them high fives and fist bumps after a successful battle, and hand out edible gifts to gain their favor. It\u2019s also really awesome that each of these companions has an alternate non-humanoid form that can be swapped out instantaneously, allowing you to do extremely useful things like ride them as a mount to cross large areas quickly or hang onto Pa-ahket\u2019s feet to glide across gaps. The only downside here is that there are half as many companions as there were in the previous game, but the very worthwhile tradeoff is that each is far more fleshed out. With so much packed into Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2, it\u2019s not very surprising that it does suffer from occasional performance issues on the Quest 3, and the odd bug here and there. You can expect the framerate to hitch every so often (which is especially jarring in VR), some long loading screens, and even a hard crash or two that will pluck you out of Egypt and send you back to your less interesting garage. I also encountered a couple annoying bugs, like one time where my companion got frozen by an enemy\u2019s ice attack then never broke free even after that ice was destroyed. However, these issues were rarely bad enough to infuriate me and certainly not common enough to be much of an issue. Instead, they were the same kinds of wonkiness I\u2019d expect from any other open-world game of this size, and in fact I\u2019d put this one on the less troublesome side of normal. Every 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given 66 Images That said, even when it\u2019s performing its best, the visual limitations of the wireless Meta Quest headsets are clear in more than a few moments. Some characters and textures can look a bit blurry or grainy at times, and there\u2019s pop-in when traveling the open world. Frankly, it\u2019s impressive that it looks as good as it does given its scope and PC-free wireless nature (the Quest is, effectively, a phone strapped to your face) and there are definitely times, like during boss fights against enormous godlike foes, where I was blown away by how beautiful it all is. I just can\u2019t help but wonder what might have been possible if this didn\u2019t also have to be able to run on the Meta Quest 2 , since that seems to be holding it back visually \u2013 or, if like the original, we were allowed to play this one on PC via AirLink. Maybe then Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 could withstand aesthetic comparisons to the likes of Half-Life: Alyx , but as it stands that\u2019s just not a fair fight. Still, I don\u2019t know that any amount of graphical fidelity gained would be worth being tethered in an adventure with this amount of spinning, platforming, and riding giant hippopotamuses across the desert, but here\u2019s hoping the Quest 3 version gets some more facelifts in the future. With all the countless ways Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 already gives you too many excuses to spend your time in its world, it\u2019s completely bonkers that they also threw in an extremely robust roguelite mode as well. This infinitely replayable game lets you explore miniature dungeon modules that become increasingly deadly as you see how far in you can go, in the hopes of setting a high score and bringing back valuable supplies to the main campaign. This mode can be played with any of the four heroes at your disposal and, amazingly, becomes more varied as you make progress in the campaign and unlock additional modules through various in-game feats. They\u2019ve even got unlockable perks to make your runs smoother, and asynchronous multiplayer via the ability to leave behind imprints of your character to either attack or assist other players in their own runs. This could honestly have been its own game, and I can see myself spending a lot of time shooting for a high score \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s thrown in here as a diversion is just nuts."

        "Content": "Every once in a long while, a game comes along that is so memorable, exciting, fresh, and well-written that it sets a new high-water mark for an entire genre. Baldur's Gate 3 is such an achievement for the tabletop roleplaying-inspired, swords and sorcery adventuring that its BioWare-made CRPG predecessors helped popularize decades ago. Larian Studios has turned this corner of Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 Forgotten Realms into a beautiful, detailed world stocked with too many fully-realized, powerfully written, and skillfully voiced characters to count. There are heart-wrenching choices to be made, alliances to be forged, bears to be romanced , and a vast diversity of interesting, challenging turn-based combat encounters. I didn't merely enjoy my 130-plus hours on this journey. I fell in love. One issue video games have often run into when trying to adapt the experience of playing Dungeons & Dragons on the tabletop is that it\u2019s almost impossible to achieve the freedom and imagination you get to express in overcoming problems using real-world logic. It's hilarious in other RPGs when you have a spell that can blow an ogre to kingdom come, but is no match for the might of a wooden gate. And while it\u2019s doubtful that any game will ever match that level of flexibility, Baldur's Gate 3 is a big step forward from what we\u2019ve been able to do in the likes of Skyrim or Dragon Age. Those gates aren't going to stop a determined warlock. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask If something looks flammable, you can probably light it up with a fire spell. If you want to save on lockpicks, most doors can be hacked down with a big enough axe. You can get to a lot of secret areas that other games would\u2019ve blocked off with invisible walls by climbing and jumping. I was able to skip a huge boss fight by challenging a terrifying zombie guy to a drinking contest and, thanks to having a high enough Constitution score , I goaded him into drinking himself to death while I was still roaring for more. This is a world that will rarely tell you, \"No,\" if you wonder if something is possible. This is a world that will rarely tell you, 'No.' \u201c And you can even bring up to three friends along with their own custom characters in co-op, both online and on the couch . I was impressed with how smooth and seamless this experience was, as joining or leaving a session regardless of where in the campaign your friends are is very easy, and I never ran into any significant connection issues or other online hiccups \u2013 though I\u2019ve definitely seen reports that other people have. Given how complex Baldur's Gate 3 is, that's impressive. It only gets better, and funnier, when you realize you can have one person distract a guard by talking to them while the other steals everything that's not nailed down behind their back. Before Baldur's Gate 3, what game has represented the pinnacle of CRPGs to you?

This character creator is one of the best I've seen outside of MMOs in a long time, featuring 29 different subraces with unique abilities and models (if you count all the different colors of dragonborn, at least). Each of the 12 classes have at least three specializations that play quite differently, with wizards and clerics getting even more to choose from. And I just love the art direction on every humanoid, enemy, and even the outfits. I've rarely experienced so much joy just looking at the beautiful, flame-haired elven ranger I designed outside of Final Fantasy XIV. It's not just the static model, either. The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces everyone can make is shockingly good for a game of this type, with hundreds of characters rather than a small, core cast who can be directed like they're in a live-action production such as The Last of Us. There's not a bit of awkward lip-syncing to be found. The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces is shockingly good. \u201c Larian\u2019s incredible attention to detail also extends to the area design and writing. That\u2019s exemplified by the city of Baldur's Gate itself, a hub full of life and adventure that came around to awe me anew, even though it took me 90 hours to reach the titular setting. Almost every citizen you\u2019ll encounter there has something to say about the unfolding events, and nosey exploration is consistently rewarded with new lore, new loot, and new quests. It's downright astounding how much voice acting Larian has crammed into these streets, and how good nearly all of it is. There are dozens of random gossipers on street corners who are just as enthusiastically and professionally portrayed as the main cast, and rarely sound too similar to each other. I assume many of the actors involved must be responsible for more than one of these bit parts, but I can't tell just by listening like I can in some areas of Skyrim. Let's Party First among this delightful cast are your companions , a motley crew of multilayered, interestingly flawed characters who both grow and sometimes regress over the course of the campaign. The cheerful, eager tiefling Karlach , who has basically a demonic bomb instead of a heart, quickly became my best friend. I had flings with the dour cleric Shadowheart , the arrogant wizard Gale , and yes, the stoic Halsin , who can turn into a grizzly bear, among other creatures. There are plenty more where they came from, and they all have elaborate background stories and the capacity to significantly grow and change. The main villains, about whom I will spoil as little as possible, are just as richly written, with complex motives and their own individual brands of malice that inject new and greater threats into the last third of this epic-length adventure. All Origin Characters in Baldur's Gate 3 8 Images I also really enjoyed Larian's approach to romance . Years of Mass Effect memes have proven that it's almost impossible to make 3D video game sex that's actually, well, sexy, and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 hasn\u2019t changed the game there. We're just not there yet, as a society. Instead of trying to do that and failing badly, they build a lot of the magic into sensual wordplay, and most of the carnal encounters you can engage in are either really funny (I mean, everyone's seen the bear scene, right?), or serve more broadly to tell you something new about your partner, how they see the world, and what they value rather than simply flashing what\u2019s underneath their armor. That's so much better than showing two naked elves awkwardly humping over some unintentionally laughable mood music like you're Dark Helmet making his action figures kiss. Combat is carefully crafted to make me want to scream at the Dungeon Master, 'You bastard!' \u201c When it was time to put our clothes back on and roll for initiative in combat, Baldur's Gate 3 never failed to impress me with the care and thoughtfulness with which the encounter design was set up to torture me. It's like each one is carefully crafted to make me want to scream at the Dungeon Master, \"You bastard!\" And I mean that in the best possible way. One fight involved teleporting imp creatures who garrote my party members before carting them off to separate locations, preventing spellcasting and forcing everyone to fend for themselves. The next might be against some terrifying insectoids who leave everyone literally petrified with fear, so I have to find a way to win without being able to move. The AI can be cunning and savage, especially on the top-level tactician difficulty. At no point have I been able to fall back on a repetitive, grinding routine. You think on your feet or you die and reload your latest quicksave. Tools of the Trade The learning curve is helped somewhat by a clean and readable UI that lets you press T when hovering over any creature, object, or key phrase in a tooltip to get more information. It's not helped, however, by a pretty inadequate set of tutorials that takes a lot of knowledge about D&D for granted. I know 5th Edition well enough that it didn't really trip me up, but I can definitely see where others would completely overlook some critical concepts like how saving throws tied to specific attributes work, and Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't care to explain them in detail. You can get by without some of this knowledge, especially on the lower difficulty, but you certainly won't master combat without it. You could benefit a lot from reading the 5E Player's Handbook before you get started, but Larian shouldn't expect that of you. So... who are you romancing? Gale Wyll Shadowheart Lae'zel Karlach Asterion Halsin Why pick just one? None Answer See Results Your character and companions also take some time and experience to develop as effective killers, and the first four levels or so can feel unnecessarily brutal due to how fragile you are when you start out. That's mostly a product of adapting 5th Edition D&D so closely, and Larian\u2019s designers didn\u2019t take it upon themselves to correct this long-running problem from the tabletop. They do, however, often give you ways to even the odds or avoid combat if you're clever \u2013 you\u2019ll do well to watch the environment for things like heavy objects hanging from a destructible thread above your enemies, or prep for combat by finding some isolated guards and kicking them over a railing while no one is looking. Your character and companions take some time and experience to develop as effective killers. \u201c But once my party got beefed up with five levels worth of upgrades and some magic items, I was happily blasting, slashing, and shooting my way through fights using all of the versatile abilities and environmental options at my disposal. My favorite pair of boots let me teleport to anywhere I could see once per day (something normally restricted to the magical classes,) which was extremely helpful for setting up my ranger in inaccessible areas with a commanding view of the battlefield. I took out some of the later bosses much more easily than I would have in a head-to-head fight simply because there was nothing stopping me from having two invisible wizards walk right up in broad daylight and hit them in the face with Disintegrate before they even knew what was happening. World of Wonders The story spans over three acts that each took me around 40 hours to complete, playing like an obsessive completionist and finishing as many side objectives as I could. Each has a very distinct vibe and look, aided by an evocative and lively soundtrack. Act 1 is mostly idyllic wilderness, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 treats us to dense, urban adventuring. It can feel a bit slow at times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation.

Much has been made of its scope, but I would honestly not have minded if it were around half as long as it is. No, the magic is in how almost none of it feels like filler, no matter how far from the main quest you stray. Every random house I wandered into or side quest I picked up rewarded me with a memorable, unique, handcrafted roleplaying experience. Even a random note found on the body of a bandit might tell a heartbreaking story about their past, which gives weight to every decision to fight and kill. It\u2019s all there for a reason. It\u2019s all there for a reason. \u201c And while the first two acts have plenty of difficult choices, the big ones I had to make before committing to a final plan of action in Act 3 are a work of devilish genius. Without spoiling anything, realizing my enemies were so many steps ahead of me by the time I reached the city was heartbreaking, but I still felt empowered by the opportunities that remained to alter my own destiny and assemble a truly impressive coalition of allies. Impressively, the last stretch often called back to things I did and characters I saved 80 hours ago, which tied the whole tale together and made the world feel even more authentic. The Best Modern RPGs 11 Images This is not a story that takes for granted that you are a hero; it's one that truly stares you down and demands that you prove it, if that's really what you're made of. The lead up to the finale backed me into a corner with a dozen ways out, but each one would require me to compromise on what I believe in in one way or another. This elevates the tension and the storytelling to new heights, which is impressive given how strong it\u2019d been up to that point. There were quests that made me cry, quests that made me yell, \"What?!\" out loud, and quests that genuinely creeped me out. And the variations in not only the ending, but also so many other smaller stories, have me eager to play it all over again. And that's really saying something, when Baldur's Gate 3 has been my full-time job for the last three weeks. Variations in not only the ending, but also so many other smaller stories, have me eager to play it all over again. \u201c It does need to be called out for some mild to moderate bugs here and there \u2013 nothing that stopped me in my tracks, of course, but enough to be annoying. There were also performance issues in Act 3 that required me to turn my settings down, even with an RTX 3080. But we\u2019ve already seen many of the worst offenders addressed with the four hotfixes that\u2019ve come out since launch, and what remains feels almost trivial next to the greatness of everything else. A game this complex will always have its share of bugs, especially at launch, and what I experienced was a more than acceptable tradeoff."

Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to pick just one, because Nintendo\u2019s response to all of those answers is a casual but confident, \u201cSure thing.\u201d The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn\u2019t necessarily revolutionize what already made Breath of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time, but it\u2019s not a sequel that\u2019s simply more of the same, either. This sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious, with creative new systems like vehicle building, ridiculous weapon crafting, and a revamped Hyrule map with a dizzying amount of depth further fleshing out the intoxicating exploration that made the original so captivating. Breath of the Wild felt far from unfinished but, inconceivably, Tears of the Kingdom has somehow made it feel like a first draft. Before we dive too deep into Hyrule, a quick note about spoilers . I won\u2019t spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but these games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the first time you see one of BotW\u2019s dragons soaring overhead is around every corner here too, and the last thing I\u2019d want to do is steal the many moments that made my jaw literally drop from you. That said, there are some huge parts of Tears that are introduced fairly early on that I will be talking about because of how fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I am going to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like millions of others) you\u2019ve already decided you are going to play Tears, you should probably just go play it and then come back to share in the wonder with me later.

It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I\u2019ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I\u2019ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven\u2019t seen before. I\u2019ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments. - Jose Otero, March 2, 2017 Score: 10 Read the full The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review On top of that, you\u2019ll likely want to have played BotW to fully understand much of what I\u2019ll be discussing here \u2013 not to mention because it\u2019s an incredible game and you\u2019re depriving yourself by skipping it. Tears looks even smarter and more expansive when you know what came before it, but many of the recognizable basics shine just as brightly. Things that are as simple as being able to climb nearly any wall or glide as far as your expandable stamina will take you, or the concept of shrines acting as self-contained puzzle chambers you can solve to boost your abilities are things I don\u2019t have time to get into here simply because there\u2019s so much new to cover. I can safely say people who enjoyed BotW will almost certainly like Tears, partly because of just how similar these two games are. The initial structure is a very familiar one: you start in a masterfully crafted introductory area where you learn the ropes and get a new set of powerful abilities, then dive into the open world with a main quest marker that quickly splits into four . From there you are free to do whatever the heck you want. You can even march right to the finale of the campaign if you know where to look, though that\u2019s not quite as straightforward to attempt this time around (which is probably for the best, as I do not recommend it for anybody but the inevitable speedrunners, whom I proudly salute). The story stands out from your typical Zelda plots. \u201c The bulk of the cutscenes and big story moments are also once again collected at specific spots around the map , shedding light on the history of Hyrule and the source of the \u201cUpheaval\u201d \u2013 a bombastic event at the start of Tears that opens up menacing chasms, causes the ruins of an ancient civilization called the Zonai to appear floating in the sky, and peppers the surface with new structures and strange anomalies. This still might not be the best storytelling structure over the course of such a large game, as it leaves you without much direct interaction with its central characters for most of your time playing, but that\u2019s very easy to forgive when the story itself is so dang cool. Sure, it\u2019s about stopping some evil jerk (welcome back, Ganondorf ) and saving Princess Zelda as usual, but the direction that familiar shell is taken is buck wild at times in the best possible way. I\u2019m still a bit amazed Nintendo decided to go the way it did, and the freshness that surprise provides helps Tears stand out amongst your typical Zelda plots. It\u2019s not storytelling on the level of a game like God of War or anything, but it can be a legitimate high point instead of simply the entertaining background flavor it was mostly relegated to in BotW. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Trailer Images 19 Images Exploration is the lifeblood of the recent Zeldas, though, and doing so is still an absolute delight in Tears \u2013 especially when the new building system empowers you to slap together custom cars, boats, and flying machines that truly let you navigate its world however you want. BotW has influenced countless other games since its release in 2017, but one of the most important lessons that very few of them seemed to learn is that a blank map can be more powerful than a full one. There is an enormous amount of stuff to do and see, and if you were handed a checklist of waypoints to methodically clear off right away it could easily feel overwhelming rather than exciting. Instead, you are given the bare minimum you need to complete the main quest, a pile of pins, and a blank map just begging you to fill it in yourself. Marking down points of interest as you dive in from the sky, hearing rumors as you talk to townsfolk, or simply getting lost and stumbling by something interesting is so much more rewarding than following an arrow to your next destination. It comes from experience, but Nintendo has incredible confidence that we will seek out the map\u2019s secrets without being led directly to them \u2013 and if we don\u2019t see absolutely everything, that\u2019s okay. It makes the whole adventure feel so natural, so much less \u201cvideo gamey\u201d than you might expect, which is particularly important when Tears basically doubles the size of this world. This may be the same map, but it in no way feels repetitive. \u201c While this is the same fundamental map of Hyrule, it in no way feels repetitive to explore \u2013 even as someone who\u2019s scoured BotW for secrets. The story doesn\u2019t give you a hard number, but it\u2019s been a few years since the defeat of Calamity Ganon, and the people are rebuilding. The main town is a brand-new outpost that has sprung up in Hyrule Field just outside of the castle, giving you a hub that evolves in entertaining ways as you progress. It\u2019s a ton of fun to recognize characters or locations and see how they\u2019ve grown or changed, but even beyond those explicit differences, Tears simply sends you along unexpected paths and to unfamiliar locations. That made me constantly see parts of Hyrule I knew and loved from a different perspective, breathing plenty of life into a map that clearly still had more than enough to give. And if that\u2019s not enough for you, there are also more substantial changes. I\u2019ll leave many of the fine details for you to find on your own, but I will say that whole areas have been drastically altered by the Upheaval, causing unexpected weather anomalies or creating brand-new terrain for chests and shrines alike to hide in. The main quest has you marching toward many of those areas head-on, but there are also plenty of examples off the beaten path that I\u2019ve discovered across the more than 100 hours of playing (and I\u2019m sure there are many more I\u2019ve missed). For example, the beach town of Lurelin in the southeast didn\u2019t play a huge role in BotW, but almost immediately Tears tells you it\u2019s been attacked by pirates, putting both its rescue and its rebuilding in your hands. Did You Replay Breath of the Wild to Get Ready for Tears of the Kingdom? Yes, within the past month. Yes, within the past six months. No, not within the past six months. No, I've only played once. I've never played it. Answer See Results And if that\u2019s not enough for you, there are also dozens and dozens of caves, wells, and sky islands to explore. These are all largely self-contained little encounters to complete, ranging from hidden fairy fountains to expansive obstacle courses that put your cleverness and combat prowess to the test. I loved stumbling upon a new cave and fighting my way through winding halls full of monsters to find some hidden piece of armor at the end \u2013 or sometimes even a larger boss monster guarding a shrine. Meanwhile, looking up instead of down, using one of the new Skyview Towers to launch myself into the air let me easily find shrines on the surface before gliding to a nearby floating archipelago filled with its own challenges to take on. And if that\u2019s still not enough for you , then boy oh boy did I save the biggest for last \u2013 and let this also serve as a final warning that if you want to know nothing beyond what\u2019s been shown in trailers and previews, turn back now (granted, this part is revealed to you very shortly after the introductory area). Even with all of what I\u2019ve talked about so far, I can understand if someone might think Nintendo took a safe route by reusing the same (if altered) map, but it was when I dove down one of the angry, red chasms that dot the surface and into the Depths below that all my doubts melted into pure, joyous amazement. Rest assured that the generally small sky islands do not represent the entirety of the new area to explore, because waiting beneath is a dangerous, pitch-black map that is literally the size of Hyrule itself . It is massive. I have played over 100 hours of Tears and I have revealed maybe half of this wondrous new area. Any doubt melted into pure, joyous amazement when I dove down my first chasm. \u201c While roughly the same size as the surface, the Depths doesn\u2019t have as much in the way of side quests or story moments but is full of treasure chests to seek out and plenty of surprises worth discovering for yourself, many of which are brilliantly hidden in plain (if very dark) sight. It acts as Zelda\u2019s version of a \u201cpoison swamp\u201d-style nightmarescape, too, thanks to a red substance called Gloom that coats both its terrain and enemies. When you take damage from Gloom, your max health is decreased until you either return to the light or eat a Gloom-removing meal, adding an enjoyable mounting pressure to every fight. What do I mean by \u201creturn to the light?\u201d That\u2019s a whole different can of worms. The Depths is completely dark (like, Advanced Darkness dark), meaning you have to throw out collectable Brightbloom Seeds as you walk to see where you are going, which gives exploration a totally different and much tenser feel. There are no shrines in the Depths; instead, there are dozens of structures called Lightroots that heal your Gloom damage and illuminate a part of the map around them when activated, giving you another completionist goal that\u2019s equal parts compelling and extensive. Taken all together, the Depths and the sky islands act as brilliant complements to the more traditional surface activities, stretching a structure I was already intimately familiar with into beautiful settings and wild situations I very much wasn\u2019t. Whether it\u2019s lighting up the darkness below, flying a custom glider between floating rocks hundreds of meters up, or just seeing what\u2019s down at the bottom of some random well, there is so much to do in Tears that it\u2019s easy to spend hours upon hours completing tasks without ever once looking at your quest log. You might be heading to a point of interest only to get sidetracked by some cave worth exploring nearby or a citizen with a quest for you, and suddenly you\u2019re off getting hopelessly distracted by a delightfully spontaneous activity that\u2019s just as exciting. That was part of the magic of BotW too \u2013 as well as plenty of other great open-world games \u2013 but now there are uncountable opportunities to end up wildly far away from where you thought (almost always incorrectly) you were going. One time I was making my way toward a tower hoping to chart a new section of the map when I stumbled upon a friendly drummer in need of some honey, so I promptly switched priorities and headed toward a nearby forest in search of bees... and of course, it wasn\u2019t very long after that I was in the literal underworld being murdered by a giant robot as a result. I just wanted some honey. Nintendo had different plans for me, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of Breath of the Wild. \u201c In 2017, I had played just over 80 hours of BotW when I finally decided to beat the final boss, feeling content that I had done all of the side quests, shrine hunting, and other odds and ends that I wanted to do. Not quite all that existed, mind you, but definitely a significant majority and certainly all of what really tempted me. Similarly, I beat Tears\u2019 main questline around the 82-hour mark, but this time I feel like I have barely done half of all the things I still want to. Even more than 20 hours after that, I still have dozens of Lightroots to find, plenty of shrines left to complete, two maps marked up with loads of unexplored points of interest, a laundry list of side quests waiting for me, and so much more. I took my time playing through the main quest stuff, too , letting myself wander and get distracted as I so love to do. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of a predecessor that made me say that exact same thing. The in-game tracker tells me I\u2019ve barely passed 50%. Send help. So much of Tears feels like a direct response to BotW and what people have said about it since its release, a fact that can be seen clearly across its bolstered enemies and weapons, but perhaps most obviously in its dungeon design. The Divine Beasts got a lot of flack for bucking usual Zelda dungeon trends, and while their equivalent in Tears doesn\u2019t scratch that itch of collecting a compass, map, and key item like in older Zelda games either, they are at least a lot more thematically interesting and varied this time around. The tasks themselves aren\u2019t actually very different from the Divine Beasts, but their flavorful new context and the epic paths that generally lead up to them are a thrill, making them all far more entertaining than the rather restrictive insides of those ancient machines. Every IGN Zelda Review Score 23 Images The other huge improvement throughout all of Tears is the boss variety. No longer are you fighting four variations of the same Ganon-adjacent enemy; you\u2019re now facing unique and often wildly entertaining foes that can occasionally stand with the greats of the series. I don\u2019t want to give away too much about them, but a standout for me was certainly a gooped-up monster that felt like a Splatoon villain had somehow infiltrated Hyrule. New boss-like enemies abound all across this map, in fact, with the returning Hinox and Talus joined by leaping Frox and fearsome three-headed Gleeok. It\u2019s not just the bosses \u2013 enemy variety as a whole has been vastly improved, and it\u2019s elevated the still rather straightforward but extremely satisfying combat as a result. At the simplest level, Bokoblins can now carry baskets of throwable items or wear armor you have to break specifically with blunt weapons, but they can also be led by a huge Boss Bokoblin that coordinates their attacks. New Horriblins menacingly crawl along cave ceilings, Constructs can shoot rocket arrows at you, Like Likes will devour you whole, and Little Frox will scurry out to eat the Brightblooms you\u2019ve worked so hard to collect and plant in the Depths. It\u2019s a wide and impressive menagerie that can genuinely push you to play differently depending on what\u2019s in front of you. The weapon fusion just says, \u201cYes\u201d to whatever you throw at it. \u201c That\u2019s also true of the absolutely absurd new weapon fusion system, which lets you attach any item or object onto any other weapon, shield, and often even arrowhead. Monster horns now act as powerful blades or bludgeons to buff your base weapons, letting you do sweet things like replace the blade of a rusty sword with the katana-like saber of a Blue Lizalfos horn. You can also do extremely dumb stuff, like put a bomb on the end of a stick to blow both you and your enemies up the moment you jab them with it, or put a minecart on a spear because\u2026 I don\u2019t know, why not? It\u2019s a system that just says, \u201cYes\u201d to whatever you throw at it, and then trusts you to figure out what\u2019s good, bad, or incredibly funny. Even though the somewhat controversial weapon durability system is back, so you should prepare for the heartbreak of your favorite sword shattering in your hands all over again, it\u2019s been totally recontextualized by this new fusion system. Suddenly, you can essentially farm strong weapons simply by killing powerful enemies, because having a bag full of monster parts is the equivalent of having dozens of backup weapons just waiting for a handle to be attached to. You won\u2019t find fire swords just lying around anymore \u2013 you have to make them, and any base sword will do fine if you\u2019ve got the horn of a fire dragon to slap onto it. Tom's Top 10 Zelda Games Here is my personal top 10 Zelda games in order. See All 1 The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Nintendo EAD 2 The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo EPD 3 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Nintendo EPD 4 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Nintendo EAD 5 The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Nintendo EAD 6 The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Nintendo 7 The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Grezzo 8 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD Nintendo EAD 9 The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Nintendo EAD 10 The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD Nintendo EAD There\u2019s loads of room to min-max and build high-damage weapons that are tailor-made to take down the hardest enemies Tears can throw at you here, but so much of the power and playstyle of a weapon coming from the attachment instead of the base meant I was always excited to hunt down more powerful parts rather than hoard what I managed to find. (Or I would just stick a stick on a stick so I could poke an enemy from twice as far away, whatever sticks for you!) Tears adds additional nuance to combat by giving you even more options to explore, too. Throwing items are now a key part of every encounter, letting you hurl everything from bombs (which are now an explosively powerful consumable item rather than a weaker but infinitely reusable ability) to special plants \u2013 like the excellent Muddle Bud that makes enemies attack each other, or the Dazzlefruit that causes them to drop their weapons. These items can be attached to arrowheads for the same effect from afar, and shields can even have objects like flame or ice throwers slapped onto them to transform them from a defensive option to an offhand weapon. The controls for throwing and attaching arrowheads started out a little tricky, since you have to select the items you want to use one at a time, but once I got the hang of it I found it to be a super-intuitive system that let me pull off cool mid-fight maneuvers I would never be able to do in BotW. The building tools walk the line of powerful but approachable extremely well. \u201c The complementary ability to weapon fusion is the boundlessly creative Ultra Hand building system. Essentially, BotW\u2019s Magnesis power got a huge upgrade that now lets you pick up, rotate, and attach almost any object to another with ease. This is supported by dozens of special objects, called Zonai Devices, that you can pull out of your inventory at any time, giving you immense freedom in how you navigate the world around you. It\u2019s amazing how often I would take a Zonai glider and a few fans out of my pocket to build a makeshift airplane and fly somewhere extremely far away extremely fast, and I loved experimenting with powered wheels to make cars that could take me from town to town faster than any horse. Your creations can even be effective in combat, with one Zonai device acting as a Roomba-like base that automatically drives toward enemies, waiting to be loaded up with whatever instruments of doom you can concoct.

Why climb that cliff when you can just strap a hot air balloon to a log and ride it up? Why swim across that river when you could quickly assemble a speedboat instead? One time I was driving a little car I\u2019d built, only to reach a dead-end mountain next to a deep valley \u2013 but instead of abandoning my creation to climb over, I channeled my inner Doc Brown and turned it into a flying car that was able to hover around the mountain instead. Did Nintendo mean for me to go that way? I have no idea. I didn\u2019t earn anything for it, but that simple act might still be one of the most rewarding gaming moments I\u2019ve had in a long time. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I was supposed to do that, but it worked\u201d sort of feels like the unofficial slogan of BotW to me, and Tears leans even harder into that creativity. These building tools are woven into every part of Tears, with most of its shrine challenges asking you to make use of them in inventive or inspiring ways. However, this isn\u2019t The Legend of Zelda: Nuts & Bolts . That is to say, this system doesn\u2019t warp Tears into something unrecognizably about building. In almost every scenario where a contraption would be the best or \u201cintended\u201d way to do something, you\u2019ll find the pieces for a simple creation sitting nearby. There\u2019s also an Autobuild ability that lets you save designs and hunt down schematics for developer-designed creations. That means Tears provides shortcuts if you aren\u2019t really interested in this side of it while simultaneously empowering those of us who are to essentially play Kerbal Space Program within The Legend of Zelda. I had tons of fun using these tools to find solutions to the problems put in front of me. A highlight is a recurring character who needs help holding up a sign at dozens of different locations around Hyrule, asking you to use nearby resources to prop it up in progressively more ridiculous situations. Getting from point A to point B can become an engaging puzzle all its own, whether that\u2019s building a contraption to help get a Korok (yes, this world is once again full of them) to his far-off friend, or making a traveling band\u2019s carriage fly to get them up a mountain side. Amidst all this cleverness there\u2019s also a hysterical air of Looney Tunes lunacy, letting you strap literal rockets to anything and everything and then watch like Wile E. Coyote as your plans disastrously blow up in your face or simply drive off out of control. Sometimes failure is just as amusing as success. It's clear Nintendo was listening to feedback after BotW. \u201c Your other two new abilities take a less prominent role, but they support the additions made elsewhere nicely. You can reverse time on objects with Recall, which is largely used either to ride rocks that have fallen from sky islands back up where they came from or to send an enemy attacks back at them in neat ways, while Ascend lets you warp through the ceiling up to whatever is above you. Given all of the caves in Tears, the ability to quickly get above ground again or climb certain mountains faster is essential, and it can even be used to find all manner of sneaky secrets. It took my brain some time to remember I even had this power, but once I started \u201cthinking with portals\u201d it became one of my favorite tools. Neither of these abilities are quite as exciting as Ultra Hand or Fuse, necessarily, but it\u2019s notable that I never once mourned the loss of Stasis or Cryonis, which are completely gone since Link no longer has the Sheikah Slate from BotW. There are also a million and a half little quality-of-life improvements that make it even harder to go back to BotW after Tears. That includes super-simple things like the fact that you are now given the option to drop a weapon, shield, or bow right away when you open a chest with a full inventory rather than having to back out first, open the menu, drop the thing, and open the chest again. But there are also more involved changes, like finally having a convenient recipe list that saves every meal and elixir you\u2019ve ever made or found, which I actually specifically said would be a great addition just a couple of weeks ago. I couldn\u2019t even begin to round up all the little bits and bobs like this, and it signals loudly that Nintendo was listening to feedback, even if it didn\u2019t always make drastic changes in response. (Click here to vote in our Legend of Zelda Face-Off!) One place Tears hasn\u2019t necessarily improved over BotW, however, is performance. This can be a beautiful game, especially when flying high above its gorgeous landscapes with a consistently incredible soundtrack in the background, but the reality is that even when running in docked mode it\u2019s still at 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second, at best. Obviously, that does not technically compare to what games on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC can do. However, unless you value resolution and frame rate above absolutely everything, including gameplay, that\u2019s not really the point. The majority of the time Tears runs just fine, but the frame rate will take noticeable dives any time there are too many effects on screen at once. It didn\u2019t feel any worse than the same exact issues in BotW, though it is a little more noticeable in the simple but charming new raids you can do against enemy camps with a group of NPC monster hunters. I also infrequently noticed things could briefly freeze while diving down quickly from the sky (the same sort of freeze BotW speedrunners see when zipping across Hyrule a little too fast). The frame rate still dips sometimes, but I saw essentially no bugs in over 100 hours. \u201c But on the whole, just as before, these issues rarely interrupt the action in a truly detrimental way. The frame rate dips can certainly be distracting at times, but the only harm they really cause is the emotional damage of making me once again pine for a Switch Pro, as we\u2019ve all been doing for the past several years. Would it look nicer on a more powerful, more modern system? Definitely, and I hope Nintendo makes one before too long. But does that mean I am going to touch my PS5 or Xbox again until I\u2019ve finished exploring this new version of Hyrule? Not a chance. It\u2019s also really quite remarkable that I saw essentially no bugs across more than 100 hours of game time, positioning it far away from a mess like last year\u2019s Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or plenty of other recent games on other platforms. Frankly, the fact that you can jump from the very top of the sky and dive all the way to the surface, straight through a chasm, and down to the floor of the Depths seamlessly, with zero load screens, on a Switch made in 2017 feels like a miracle, and that makes overlooking the handful of moments I saw it hang for a second or two while doing so incredibly easy."

        "Content": "Seven dwarves set out from the Mountainhomes to establish a new colony in world rife with gods, monsters, and ancient legends. Though small, these dwarves are the heroes of our tale: Short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry. In their ingenuity they will craft incredible artifacts, face great evils, and establish a citadel to stand the test of ages... or they'll dig a little too close to a volcano and flood the whole thing with lava. Then you'll generate another world, with brand new gods, monsters, and ancient legends, and do it all again. All that and more is par for the course in Dwarf Fortress, perhaps the most cult in the pantheon of cult-classic video games, has been generating stories of triumph and tragedy for nearly 20 years already. Its incredible depth has long been locked behind an accessibility barrier of text-based ASCII graphics, arcane keyboard controls, and an inscrutable maze of fan-created mods and tilesets to make it more approachable. And while that admittedly high wall was already worth climbing over, its premium release on Steam brings new graphics and a slew of quality-of-life improvements that fundamentally enhance this amazing game for the next generation of storytellers. Dwarf Fortress Steam Screenshots 14 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Even if you never dared these intimidating tunnels yourself, you\u2019ve almost certainly felt Dwarf Fortress\u2019 impact elsewhere. Developer Bay 12 Games effectively founded the genre we now call the Colony Sim with its initial release in 2006, paving the way for games like RimWorld while influencing countless others, and it's still a reminder of how this combination of procedural generation and rules-based, reality-driven simulation can create unparalleled stories on the fly. Even today, among its many successors, nothing creates a world and fills it with interesting characters so reliably as Dwarf Fortress, and it is a sublime experience to watch this simulation of a world at work as you play your part in it. Doing so is far easier now. The refreshed graphics use a system of sprites, dynamically assembled, to show the dwarven world in all its glory. There are graphics for hundreds of different animals and animal-men, not to mention for dragons, hydras, unicorns, and the like. Even the special Forgotten Beasts, Titans, and Demons, randomized and unique as they are, have generated appearances to match. Beyond improving on ASCII symbols, the sprites and tiles \u2013 both static and dynamic \u2013 are a superb example of the pixel artist's craft. Even if you've never played it, you\u2019ve almost certainly felt Dwarf Fortress\u2019 influence. \u201c This fresh coat of paint is overlaid with a lively new soundscape of nature noises, dwarven work, tavern chatter, and whistling cavern winds that provides an actual sense of place. Atop that is a soundtrack of classical guitar (an homage to the single-track guitar noodling that once accompanied the free version of Dwarf Fortress) that both fits the legacy and includes delights like singing in the actual in-game dwarven language. Perhaps most notably, Dwarf Fortress\u2019 Steam version brings the controls out of the early \u201890s, adding the integrated ability to use the mouse, a fully-fledged graphical interface, and settings menus rather than being forced to directly edit game files if you want to adjust difficulty. The proper mouse support alone is, to me, worth the cost of entry here: You can paint out walls, mining tunnels, and more with ease. More vital for new players, you can click a tile to easily get a tabbed inventory of everyone and everything on it, including quick buttons for basic interactions like forbidding your dwarves to touch it \u2013 you know, for when you kill that giant six-eyed cave bird with poisonous blood and your chef immediately tries to get a jump start on tomorrow's dinner. Dwarf Meets World For all that improvement \u2013 and it is a shockingly huge and remarkably thorough improvement \u2013 Dwarf Fortress is still an unapologetically complex game underneath. Its new tutorials go a long way toward teaching you how to play by setting you up with a world, a relatively safe embark site, and a fortress that can supply its own necessities (e.g. food and booze). Even so, a tutorial still can't teach a tenth of what you\u2019ll likely want to know over the course of your adventure, and those new to this genre will need patience. This is, after all, a game where you have to construct separate workshops to spin plant fiber into thread, then weave thread into cloth, then optionally dye the cloth, before making even a single dwarven sock. It's a game where you'll become an amateur mineralogist \u2013 as all good dwarves are \u2013 to figure out where in the geological strata to dig for iron, tin, coal, or gold. You'll somehow learn the difference between gabbro and granite. You'll almost certainly read an article describing what a quern is. It sounds like a lot \u2013 and it is \u2013 but learning real-world information and then being able to immediately employ it in your game is extremely rewarding. One of the biggest conceits in Dwarf Fortress is that you can't directly control your dwarves, outside of actively mobilized military squads. You're a kind of central planner, setting up labor permissions, directing production, and blueprinting their constructions, but how soon any of it happens is up to them. They might be too busy taking a nap, or eating, or listening to the local bard tell a story. And it's delightful that you can't make them do a damn thing, because dwarves each have an entire simulated inner life of their own. They have thoughts, memories, favorite things, personal skills, relationships, and physical traits, all of which you can read about in menus or sometimes see on their sprites. The sheer complexity of the simulation means they\u2019ll occasionally make bizarre decisions because of who they are, and the procedural nature of it all means that those are sometimes hysterical, frustrating, or even poignant. Everyone has their own tale of the time a dwarf sprinted into a goblin horde to get their socks. \u201c For example, dwarves are infamous for leaving things outside the fortress and then later trying to retrieve them no matter the circumstances. Everyone has their own tales of the time Urist sprinted out into a goblin horde because they forgot their socks in the pasture, or of moments when a horrible beast emerged from the caverns \u2013 opposed only by your brave militia \u2013 and some hapless child went skipping through the battlefield to go and pick mushrooms in the lower caves. That simulated idiocy can be obnoxious at times, but it can also result in some beautiful stories. I once had two dwarves, a doctor and surgeon, who decided to get married in the middle of an ongoing crisis. As nearby patients cried out in pain amid my hospital room and enemies were at the gates, they had their wedding officiated by their friend, a farmer. Poignant, as though they\u2019d decided that if their lives were threatened they would rather die married than apart. Hilarious, because a patient was still sitting open on the surgical table and everyone involved was spattered with blood as vows were exchanged. The Helmedstabs Chronicles In 2019, IGN's own Justin Davis wrote about the wonders of Dwarf Fortress , calling it \"easily the deepest - and maybe most harrowing - sim game out there.\" In that article he included the story of one of his own playthroughs: The Helmedstabs Chronicles. You can flip through the entire thing below and see how this particular world went for him in a pre-Steam version of Dwarf Fortress: Dwarf Fortress: The Helmedstabs Chronicles 39 Images Dwarf Fortress is also unapologetic about how much reading is involved, which is reams, as this is a game that generates whole novels worth of tall tales. Basically, none of these stories happen without reading a dwarf's thoughts or observing their relationships in the character menu that pops up when you click on them. The addition of graphics helps, but this is still in many ways a text-based game. You read descriptions of objects, of people, of combat, because Dwarf Fortress focuses all its energy on creating and simulating events that happen, not on rendering them in great detail as they happen. These stories are everywhere in Dwarf Fortress, especially as your fort population climbs into the dozens, and finding them is part of play. Notifications let you know that certain things are happening, but to fully understand them you have to read the event logs, look at the life histories of your dwarves, and spend some time paused just poking around in the day-to-day of your fort. It's deeply rewarding for those who are curious and introspective, or who enjoy roleplaying their fortress inhabitants and figuring out why they do what they do. Dig, Baby, Dig This is a nerd game par excellence, asking for attention and caring in a vast range of subjects and disciplines, where there is always something new to learn, a challenge to attempt, or an absurd project to try. I don't find all its complexity scary or intimidating; it\u2019s more of a challenge I want to rise to. Building a fort is a sandbox, and you can engage \u2013 or not \u2013 with many of the systems in Dwarf Fortress to your own heart's desire. I don't like fiddling with windmills and powered pumps, for example, so I rarely use them. The sheer flexibility of the systems in Dwarf Fortress are really only limited by your imagination, your understanding of how they work, and your comprehension of the interface. The procedurally generated worlds pop up remarkably fast, letting you create new ones almost at a whim, each with its own cast of characters, civilizations, artifacts, gods, religions, stories, books, instruments, and more \u2013 all with history that stretches back centuries before the \u201cpresent day\u201d you start in. Not that you need more than one world for hundreds of hours of play, considering they come complete with biomes to build in as diverse as swamps, tundras, grasslands, deserts, badlands, mountains, coastlines, marshes, riversides, and jungles, to name a bare few, and each has good, evil, and savagely primordial variants. You're here to collaborate with game systems, not fight them. \u201c As long as you go in knowing that most fortresses end in ruin of one kind or another, you understand that you're here to collaborate with game systems, not fight them. The new controls lend so much power to that style of play; the simple ability to click through the interface makes building workshops and placing furniture a breeze, and letting your dwarves just build them out of whatever material is convenient rather than optimizing exactly what stone is used for a kiln takes some of the busywork out of common tasks. The same goes for above-ground constructions, once a laborious process of scrolling back and forth between the Z-levels of Dwarf Fortress\u2019 2D top-down map, now made simpler by the convenience of a default view that properly shows what's beneath empty tiles. That's great, because construction is an entire subgame of its own. Placing fortifications and workshops or building guard towers is one end of it, but so is optimizing efficient fortress designs where dwarves travel a minimal distance from their beds to meals and workshops. You can set things up so your fort becomes a hub of crafts and trade, selling carved-stone tchotchkes and baubles to the wider world, or one where dwarf smiths use the secrets of steelmaking to forge an invincible military. You can build a massive statue and light its eyes with magma pulled from the earth's depths, or create a complex system of pumps to irrigate vast caverns for mushroom farming. The Best PC Games 26 Images It's incredibly fun to place sequences of devious traps, like pits that open on a pressure plate, blades that emerge from walls, triggered crossbows, or more elaborate designs: Some of my favorites are entire false entrance ways that open, let in attackers, and then seal before flooding with water or magma. I\u2019ve used minecarts filled with swords that stop abruptly and fling their contents into the enemy at high speed \u2013 we call those dwarven shotguns. Or you can opt for the direct approach, where you train a dwarf army and send it off-map to conquer nearby towns or cities, demanding shipments of supplies as tribute. The ultimate fate of all forts is to fall into ruin or be retired when you get bored of its success, and having a fort either get destroyed or simply peter out is part of how you learn the deep systems, gaining ever more knowledge of how to survive dwarven life for next time.  The community's motto has long been that \"Losing is Fun!\", and you'll see players describing doomed ends that range from poisonous monster breath to dwarven civil wars as a potential source of that \"Fun.\" You set your own goals \u2013 become the new Mountainhome, subjugate your neighbors, or just have the happiest dwarves in the world, among many other possibilities. Sometimes a good day is seeing one of your dwarves likes frogs, then making them frog statues. \u201c One of my favorite game challenges to build around comes when you open up the large, subterranean caverns beneath the earth, home to creatures like giant white crocodiles, impish crundles, or pale, blind cave ogres. Opening caves then attracts wandering monster-slaying adventurers who will petition to live in your fort so they can explore the depths, which means you'll probably want to build\u2026 a really cool tavern, complete with staff and bards. All adventurers need a tavern, after all. I love to read the combat logs of slayers against monsters. Though the most complex battles in Dwarf Fortress may look like two swarms of blinking sprites smashing into each other on the surface, diving into the details of what's happening both during and after a fight is great. Spears get stuck in bone, limbs are severed, and wounded warriors slip in puddles of their own blood. Desperate fights come down to unarmed struggle, with one side choking the life out of the other. This struggle really means a lot once you get to know the characters in question, by both directing and learning about their lives. Sometimes a good day in Dwarf Fortress is fighting off a dragon attack. Sometimes it's seeing that one of your dwarves likes frogs, and then making some frog statues for their bedroom. Peak Performance Of course, many of the places where the new version of this vast and beautiful game has flaws are the same as they have been for years. For instance, so much is going on at any given time that performance inevitably suffers as maps grow in size and complexity. The latest version runs smoother than ever, but can slow to a low-FPS crawl when large crowds of characters or creatures show up unexpectedly. Setting high limits and building ever-larger fortresses will inevitably bring what the community calls FPS Death, with forts of more than 200 dwarves becoming unsustainable on any but the beefiest PCs. As always, generating smaller background worlds and picking smaller fortress sites helps \u2013 as does stuff like making sure your dwarves throw their dirty socks into a magma-based disposal system to reduce the number of objects that must be tracked in the world. That comes back to the interface, which makes a heroic effort but still struggles to contain the sheer volume of content that Dwarf Fortress contains right off the bat, let alone what it generates during play. Just like its performance, this newest version is leaps and bounds better than its predecessors, but the usability is still limited by your patience with learning where any given piece of information is kept. Dwarves alone have a dozen tabs and subtabs in their information panel, and a single game tile can contain multiple objects to be clicked on and have their descriptions read. Have you ever played Dwarf Fortress? Since the very first alpha! Yes, at some point or another over the last decade Only since its Steam release No, never No, but I want to now! Answer See Results That does mean it's much easier to do many things, though. Managing dwarf labors and preferences \u2013 like what to do with their trash, what goods to stock at the trade depot, or how many people are on the mining detail \u2013 comes down to either a simple checkbox system or categorized lists that have a rudimentary search or sort. But it can still get overwhelmed fast by lots of items, and lacks some basic UI comforts like hotkeys for moving items to the top or bottom of lists. It's not very fun to click a bunch of specific items, all in a row, to trade away. The updated controls are pretty flexible, at least, and let you rebind just about anything. That\u2019s a smart, player-friendly nod to the fact that learning hotkeys and shortcuts will still be important to make any experience playing Dwarf Fortress smooth. For me, learning where every nugget of information is kept and the fastest way to access it is part of the charm. You can't love Dwarf Fortress and also complain that it's too complicated to play \u2013 its complexity necessitates its form. In a similar vein, you wouldn\u2019t buy a Porsche or Ferrari and then complain that it requires constant maintenance to reach its potential. Dwarf Fortress is complicated because it is a machine made by two dedicated craftspeople over decades, tuned for precisely one glorious purpose: to generate entire worlds and fill them with endless adventure."

        "Content": "How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life \u2013 but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it\u2019s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape. Keeping things broad and spoiler-free, Kratos' story picks up a few years after the final revelations of 2018's God of War \u2013 this is absolutely not one of those sequels where everything will make sense without playing the first game, or at the very least watching the included story recap (which is probably too brief to serve as anything but a jolt to the memory). The apocalyptic Ragnarok is coming, and its events circle around his son Atreus like one of Odin's ravens. Fimbulwinter \u2013 a time of unrest that presages Ragnarok \u2013 has very much come and, during the intervening years, Atreus has been growing stronger, learning about his Giant name \"Loki\", and trying to convince his father to trust him. There are touching callbacks to the hunting scene from the 2018 God of War as Kratos proudly watches Atreus prove that he\u2019s no longer a child. But it\u2019s no slow introduction: Ragnarok wastes no time in stepping into the action and, after a breakneck opening battle, the first step of this new journey is to leave the frozen realm of Midgard and find a missing Norse god in the broader and varied universe. God of War Ragnarok Preview 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It may not be as tightly told a story as 2018's, but Ragnarok has much grander designs. This is a sprawling epic that always keeps things on the move without ever becoming disorientating, gluing me to the edge of my seat as it repeatedly toyed with expectations. It's an ambition regularly met by stunning execution, with a momentum that never slips as you hurtle towards its bombastic ending. This journey took me just over 28 hours with a few fair side quests completed along the way, but with plenty still left to do afterward. Prophecy and sacrifice swirl at the story\u2019s centre as it repeatedly prods at the concept of destiny and whether blood runs thicker than the ink that pens it. It doesn\u2019t merely offer up surface-level readings of these themes; instead, each character and their motives are given the respect they deserve by delving in deep. It\u2019s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos\u2019 Norse saga, as well as providing resolution to some of his more troubled Greek memories. It\u2019s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos\u2019 Norse saga. \u201c There are twists and turns aplenty, with fakeouts and misdirection woven into the story\u2019s fabric as it darts between loud spectacle and tender conversation. Characters old and new play their own crucial parts, including fresh characterisations of Norse behemoths like Thor and Odin, with a line of dialogue rarely wasted between them. These are truly unique depictions, and it's a credit to Sony Santa Monica and the actors playing each that I wasn\u2019t reminded once of their MCU equivalents. Despite being laden with myth and melodrama, there's still plenty of time for welcome pockets of self-aware silliness that almost always elicit a laugh, whether that be another bizarre dwarven contraption or the simple thrill of Kratos eating a sausage. When not eating dinner, Kratos\u2019 thunderous voice actor Christopher Judge frequently engages in smartly realised dialogue with his equally impressive castmates. Make no mistake, though: this is firmly Judge's court, and one he frequently dominates. Kratos' traumatic personal history is reflected in everything from his mournful tone of voice to his appearance - his Icarus wings are long-since clipped, but his complexion is still pale like a square of wall where a family portrait used to hang. Death weighs heavy in the winds that guide him on every journey he takes, whether delivering it himself or searching for some closure. The everlasting cycle of violence between parents and their children has long been a theme ever since the original God of War trilogy, although one that was only truly emphasised in 2018\u2019s revival. Now it\u2019s an inescapable fixture of Ragnarok; an exploration of the rawest and most human of emotions, and what happens when they are channeled through superhuman vessels. Pain leads to anger, anger leads to hate \u2013 this is the genesis of the stalking threat embodied by the incomparable force that is a grieving mother. Portrayed incredibly with a newfound fury by Danielle Bisutti, Freya is a striking presence to be reckoned with in the sequel and casts a much darker shadow this time around. No longer just a helpful witch in the woods, she\u2019s given a whole new spectrum of emotional depth to play in, and Ragnarok is all the better for it. Each character is given their own moments to shine throughout; Sunny Suljic fires back regularly with the sharp, teenage tongue of a brasher, more confident Atreus, and Alastair Duncan\u2019s severed head accessory Mimir continues to provide levity and exposition in abundance. Various newcomers to the vastly expanded cast also deliver fantastic performances, with a particular standout being Laya DeLeon Hayes, radiating infectious energy from the mysterious Angrboda. Ben Prendergast brings warmth to the nuanced T\u00fdr \u2013 he's charmingly plucky as the Norse God of War. The foul-mouthed Brok and skittish Sindri continue to bring their unique brand of dwarven charm while granting you those all-important upgrades. They often provide pockets of humour, as well as a lot of genuinely helpful info along the way as they play a much more central role in the story this time around. Also returning is composer Bear McCreary, whose score \u2013 like the dwarven smith brothers \u2013 goes hammer and tongs from the first moment to the last. There's some truly beautiful music to be heard along the journey, as well as explosions of raw orchestral power during intense fight scenes. The artistry bursting from every seam is astonishing \u2013 even when running in the high frame-rate favouring Performance mode \u2013 with excellent costume and world design on show. Ragnarok is incredibly well polished, with little details from the etchings on a dagger to the clunk of a cupboard door closing shown love. It\u2019s expertly animated, with saliva-sputtering grimaces launching towards the lens during the heat of battle, and hair flowing realistically on Kratos\u2019 less-follically challenged enemies. Every 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given 66 Images Layered writing, impeccable acting, and stunning set design are all crucial aspects in driving God of War\u2019s filmic aspirations home, but they\u2019re also never let down by the rock-solid technical craftsmanship at work. The one continuous camera shot style of 2018's reboot returns, snaking through the entirety of Ragnarok as if mimicking the world serpent J\u00f6rmungandr himself. The technique may have lost a little of its initial wow factor four years on, but it's still a remarkably impressive achievement that has several new tricks to show off, and only adds to Ragnarok's cinematic nature. A Song of Ice and Fire God of War\u2019s combat has always been the flashy attraction that draws a crowd in to be wowed by its story, however, and Ragnarok continues that tradition. It may seem familiar at first \u2013 and indeed some things remain the same \u2013 but it isn't afraid to play with expectations and throw a curveball your way. Kratos\u2019 blades whip around in every direction, delivering a clanking firey pain to any face they meet. Heavy cleaves of his axe crunch into enemies, making them fold like bloodied origami. And yes, that axe still slices through the air, meatily lodging itself into anything unfortunate enough to be in its path, before being recalled to your palm with a hearty kick from the DualSense controller\u2019s haptics in what remains one of the most satisfying button presses ever assigned to a controller. It's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious \u2013 harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted. It's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious \u2013 harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted. \u201c There\u2019s a fair helping of excessive violence on show, with Kratos willfully impaling and ripping apart any enemy put in front of him. Arenas are often tight spaces full of threats, and though you aren\u2019t going to see the return of dozens of enemies on screen at once that spawn in wave after wave, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some aspects of those older games shining through. But even with that slight shift to old-school action, Ragnarok\u2019s eyes are still drawn more to the shimmer of Nathan Drake's gold rather than Bayonetta's platinum. Cinematic spectacle takes precedence over the chaotic, bordering-on cartoonish action of old. The axe feels largely similar to how you remember (and that\u2019s no bad thing) with its dynamic mix of heavy attacks and ranged power, but how you wield the blades is noticeably different. There's a greater emphasis on using them to hook enemies and maneuver them around the arena \u2013 whether that be dragging them in towards you or juggling them in the air like the hottest of potatoes. They're much closer to how they felt in the original games; a nostalgic move set with a brilliant modern edge. The action feels and looks outstanding and there are no caveats or exceptions when I say that Ragnarok is only an improvement over God of War\u2019s already ferocious combat. Both weapons have new tricks to show off, too: you can \u201cFrost Awaken\u201d the axe by holding in the triangle button to power up your next attack, or mash the same button while the blades are equipped to ignite them. Locking down an enemy by freezing them with the axe before switching to the blades to unleash pain on their friends is an endless source of enjoyment. Even the shield is now more of an offensive tool, and different types can be bought and crafted to fit your playstyle. A sturdier one can soak up heavier hits, while a high-risk/reward version boosts your parry's effectiveness. Parrying has a delicious weightiness to it, and when you nail the timing, it still feels fantastic after the thousandth deflect. Trust me when I say that's a skill you'll want to perfect before taking on some of Ragnarok's toughest fights, as well. Runic abilities (special cooldown attacks assigned in your inventory) also return and, while there isn\u2019t the same abundance of choice this time around, each is devastatingly effective. For example, Hades Retribution \u2013 a fiery stab that lodges a bomb into the ribcage of an enemy \u2013 is particularly fun to put into action. Brutal finishers on stunned enemies are another enjoyable throwback to the God of War of old. Heads are dismembered, waists are left standing and spouting blood, and torsos are carved in two. There's noticeably a good amount of variety in the randomly chosen, weapon-specific animations, too, so you won't get bored of seeing that one head stomp execution move from 2018 over and over again. My favourite has to be the simple pleasure of seeing the shock on a soldier\u2019s face as their arms are hacked off one by one. Beautiful. Most importantly, all of these additions give an extra tactical edge as you mix up the cadence of your strikes and control each fight. Kratos is a little lighter on his feet this time around, with a bit less of a thumping clomp to his sprint. Movement is further emphasised by the way you can now grapple up from a distance using the blades, and launch across gaps to dive into combat. Taller arena design literally adds extra layers to battles, allowing you to leap from a ledge to deliver death from above. Combat sequences can feel akin to Doom kill boxes as you dash and swing around elevated platforms toward your next victim in performances of acrobatic bloodshed \u2013 juggling cooldowns, Atreus\u2019 arrows, and your rage meter to efficiently and spectacularly destroy everyone sent to stop you.

Each fight feels like a real occasion as you slalom your way through ranged, parryable, and unblockable attacks in order to sneak in a hit or two. Enemies can now perform powerful-but-interruptible attacks signified by a blue ring above their head in addition to their regular skills. A double tap of the shield will sort these out, but get your timing wrong and you're in line for some considerable pain. Combat really develops over time too, as small wrinkles and bigger game-changers are introduced throughout. Environmental strikes \u2013 such as ripping a jagged tree from the ground before swinging it like an oversized baseball bat \u2013 are often available to introduce to an unfortunate soul\u2019s face. There are plenty of other big additions to combat that I won\u2019t divulge so as not to ruin the sensation of discovering them yourself, but Ragnarok includes some of the most eye-catchingly colourful magic attacks I\u2019ve ever seen in a game, beautifully destructive summon abilities, and much, much more. All are further examples of Sony Santa Monica's seemingly endless pool of creativity. Ragnarok has myriad more tools in its bag than God of War 2018 ever did, and is all the more enthralling for it. It all feels exceptional when in full flow, often mesmerising with its top-tier action drenched in rhythmic brutality, and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game. It all feels exceptional when in full flow and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game. \u201c And that just goes for the regular fights. Boss battles are of both a higher quantity and quality, including one encounter that makes the opening Stranger fight from 2018 look like a playground scuffle. There are definitely some of those huge boss fights that were so much more prevalent in the original trilogy this time around, with creatures regularly of a bigger scale than we saw four years ago. A lot of these one-on-one encounters are a true test of your capabilities as well, and even when playing on the Give Me Balance (medium) difficulty setting I\u2019ve found myself needing resurrection stones far more than I did in the previous game. It\u2019s not just the story bosses, either \u2013 I\u2019ve fought massive alligator bastards called Dreki on more than one occasion, which are a real event to fight and more of a challenge than 2018\u2019s trolls ever posed. It's great to see sprinklings of that old-school monster mayhem thrown into the mix, which manages to successfully offset some of the more serious stretches of the story. Puzzles offer much of what you'd expect \u2013 lodging the axe into objects to keep them from moving or freezing them to redirect water flows, burning vines to get elevators working, etc. Smart new puzzle ideas are consistently introduced, though, and build in complexity throughout as more abilities are added to your arsenal. They\u2019re often fun and never in danger of slowing your progress to the detriment of the plot, but even so, Atreus or Mimir can come in with a hint far too early and sometimes rob you of that satisfying \"aha!\" moment. It's a very rare annoyance in a world where normally every last word is a joy to listen to.  Armor customisation has been streamlined, resulting in the removal of the slotting system for a more straightforward upgrading mechanic. Enchantments are now placed inside a separate amulet rather than spread over various pieces of gear. This division makes seeing what you have equipped easier and means you aren't lost delving into too many menus within menus. This also means you can upgrade a piece of armour and take it with you through your journey if your playstyle happens to perfectly click with a certain set (or if you just love how it looks). I found myself changing up my builds regularly throughout, however, as I kept wanting to experiment with all Ragnarok has to offer. The same goes for weaponry, which can be upgraded, as well as fitted with attachments such as individually named hilts and handles, each with its own perks and bonuses. Who wouldn\u2019t want to play with the Stonecutter\u2019s Knob, after all? Further experimentation is encouraged by the new skill token system, which allows you to add damage, stun, elemental, and other boosts to any unlocked ability. It really does feel more like you're being encouraged to build your Kratos this time around, rather than playing with a pre-designed action figure straight out of the box. It\u2019s not stingy on the availability of resources needed to craft gear, further prompting you to inject your personality into a build. It\u2019s an accessible level of RPG tinkering without ever becoming overwhelming. Realms Reborn Realms old and new are regularly a sight to behold \u2013 many looking torn from the pages of fairy tales, stocked with oversized flora and fauna. There's an extra effort to delve deeper into the mythology this time around and, as someone who's a fan of the Nordic source material, it's a real pleasure to see all of the different interpretations of creatures, people, and places they inhabit brought to life in all manner of delightfully weird ways. The dwarven city of Nidavellir is a welcome rural change of scenery, with its many homes and tunnels that Kratos must amusingly crawl around in. It's at the centre of the rocky realm of Svartalfheim, where waterways weave through islets littered with bubbling geysers. There\u2019s a real sense that the realm was ripped right out of the Old Norse Poetic Edda\u2019s home of Iceland. Those geysers are also key to solving many of the puzzles in the region as you freeze them to create stepping stones and manipulate machinery \u2013 quirks like this help in making each place feel unique. Similarly, fun new ideas are introduced in the returning Alfheim, such as reflective crystals that you can ricochet your axe off of to open doors or even use to blindside unwitting opponents in combat. It's a further example of not only each realm looking distinct, but also feeling distinct to play in from one another. Every location almost feels like a puzzle box that you\u2019re gradually unlocking through a combination of brain and brawn as you make your way through it. There's also plenty to discover, with some realms surprising in their vastness. Exploration is encouraged via boat on the Dwarven seas, or via dog sled across Elven deserts. Once again, Metroidvania elements encourage you to revisit blocked paths at a later date once you own the skill required. These new worlds bring with them dangerous new threats. If there were any faults to be found in 2018's revival, then modest enemy variety may well have been one of them. However, there is no such issue in Ragnarok, with its bestiary vastly expanded to accommodate all sizes and shapes of creatures. Familiar foes such as draugr and elves have made their way across, but this time they're joined by Grims which, you guessed it, are pretty grim scuttling toad people, and a personal favourite, the Einherjar; Aesir warriors who harness the power of the Bifrost that makes a section of your health bar glow before removing that chunk on the next hit. Each forms a part of a whole \u2013 there\u2019s an engaging but never unfair difficulty curve throughout as you\u2019re met with progressively greater threats. Side missions are sometimes spectacles in their own right. Standout Favours involve helping giant creatures in distress and adventures full of personal revelations through the lush jungles of Vanaheim. They are a great source of character development as you learn more about your friends and companions by helping them right past wrongs. Some side quests do just present a pure gameplay challenge over extra stories, however, such as hunting down powerful legendary enemies dotted across the realms of Yggdrasil\u2019s roots. Which video game sequel is the best? Portal 2 Mass Effect 2 Red Dead Redemption 2 Half-Life 2 Other (tell us in the comments!) Answer See Results There is no shortage of genuinely tough side boss encounters, either. While I was perhaps taking them on too early out of eagerness, they were a great test of skill nonetheless. Chipping away at larger health bars is a really satisfying challenge and remarkably well-balanced against the standard quick-kill nature of the majority of Ragnarok\u2019s fights. It\u2019s yet another testament to the masterful combat design on display. And yes, there are some absolutely tough-as-nails, endgame-level challenges to rival the Valkyries of 2018, but I'm going to let you find out what those are for yourself. There's a substantial slew of collectibles to clean up as well with Odin's Ravens, puzzle chests, artifacts, and much more to find in every corner. There's a ton to be done after the main story has been brought to a close, all of it incredibly moreish and fun to complete. Regardless of their nature, all of the optional content is joyously snackable. They not only flesh out the world of Ragnarok and riff smartly on the mythology, but also serve as valuable father-and-son time, with the end of the world creeping ever closer. God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it. \u201c Ragnarok never once rests on its laurels, throwing new ways to play at you until the very end. Despite having a seemingly endless amount to praise here, I really have barely scratched the surface of what God of War Ragnarok has to offer \u2013 I\u2019m deliberately omitting dozens of secrets and surprises. I wouldn't dare spoil what's to come for anyone booting it up for the first time, but rest assured, there are both huge story moments and fresh gameplay additions that live up to and often surpass expectations. Taken all together, much like The Godfather Part 2, God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it."

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask December 7, 2022: Elden Ring wins IGN's Game of the Year Award for 2022 In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe \u2013 from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I\u2019ve ever had. To set the stage, all you know from the outset is that you play as a \u201cTarnished\u201d of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. What that actually means, how one might go about doing that, and what the deal is with that giant glowing golden tree are all things that you have to discover yourself. Like other FromSoft games, the grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there\u2019s no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours. There really should be, but it is a story I nonetheless enjoyed trying to piece together for myself. I look forward to supplementing that knowledge with the inevitable painstakingly detailed lore videos that emerge from the community later. It ended up being the organic side stories that kept me most enthralled rather than the grand overarching plot that credits Game of Thrones\u2019 George R.R. Martin as its scenario writer. FromSoft smartly doesn\u2019t change much in its approach to these from the Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro; you\u2019ll just naturally meet characters as you explore and discover the world and become involved in their problems. There are no \u201c!\u201d markers on the map, no waypoints to guide you to them, and these characters don\u2019t always flag you down or initially want or need anything from you. They\u2019re just people with their own agendas and goals, whose stories are impacted based on your own actions or inactions. I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map. \u201c That was actually kind of refreshing in an open world as vast as this one, and it was always exciting to see a familiar face pop up again later as I was eager to learn about what brought them to this new part of the world and how their journey had progressed. The trade-off, of course, is that without any markers, quest log, or journal, it becomes very easy to forget about certain plot threads and accidentally leave them unresolved by the end. That\u2019s a bummer, and I\u2019ve already felt regret at missing out on stories that some of my colleagues have had \u2013 but for me it was worth it, because even after 87 hours, I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map absolutely full of unresolved sidequest markers. Besides, any missed quests give me extra incentive to continue onto New Game+. Up until this point, which From Software game has been the toughest? Demon's Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls 3 Bloodborne Sekiro Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results \u201cFreedom\u201d is the word that every aspect of Elden Ring\u2019s design connects back to. From the moment you set foot in Limgrave , the first of many interconnected regions of The Lands Between, you are completely free to go wherever you want. And sure, that\u2019s far from a new concept in open-world games, but the way it's handled here is truly extraordinary. If you wanted to, you could be an explorer and spend hours upon hours in Limgrave, delving into every mini dungeon , fighting every boss , discovering every NPC, and leveling yourself up to better prepare for what\u2019s next. Alternatively, you could follow the Light of Grace, guiding you toward the main path and the first major dungeon \u2013 or you could find a hidden path to a new region that\u2019s meant for higher levels and completely bypass the first major dungeon entirely! Maybe even steal yourself a cool weapon early while you\u2019re there. A few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. \u201c Again, this is not unprecedented, but a few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. For one, Elden Ring doesn\u2019t scale enemy levels to match your own at all, so jumping into a later region means you\u2019re always dealing with stronger enemies, making the risk/reward prospect of doing so very real. But perhaps more notably, the way its different areas are connected makes finding these new ones more than a simple matter of choosing a direction and heading towards it. Limgrave is designed very specifically with a main path in mind that takes you through Stormveil Castle , and finding a way around that truly feels like you\u2019ve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I\u2019ve explored. Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review 49 Images You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous FromSoft game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there\u2019s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you , each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can e quip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill. Elden Ring's difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. \u201c The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games \u2013 weapon affinities and weapon skills \u2013 by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let\u2019s say I find a really good rapier and I really like the moveset, but I\u2019m building my character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won\u2019t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If I find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, I can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if I eventually decide to respec into a different build , I can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons. The most important element of Elden Ring\u2019s philosophy, though, is the freedom to just walk away and do something else when you hit a wall. Elden Ring is hard \u2013 which is to be expected from a FromSoft game \u2013 but its difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. I hit multiple points, even all the way up until the moment when I reached the very last boss, where I\u2019d unlocked paths to several bosses and simply could not make headway on any of them. But even though I hit dead ends on those paths, there was always somewhere else I could go \u2013 a region I hadn\u2019t thoroughly explored, an NPC quest that I had set aside for later, a Light of Grace indicator that I had not yet followed. There was never a point in Elden Ring when I was at a complete loss of what to do, and every time I explored those other regions and followed those alternate paths I would find new gear and items, level up my stats, or learn new spells or skills that would eventually give me the extra edge I needed to power through a boss that had given me problems. What We Said About Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Sekiro evolves From Software\u2019s formula into a stylish stealth-action adventure that, naturally, emphasizes precision and skill in its combat. It walks the line between deliberate and patient stealth and breakneck melee combat against threats both earthly and otherworldly. Its imaginative and flexible tools support a more focused experience that shaves down some of From Software\u2019s overly cryptic sensibilities without losing its air of mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors. - Brandin Tyrrel, March 21, 2019 Score: 9.5 Read the full Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice review It isn\u2019t just the promise of making my numbers go up that called me to turn over every stone on the map: The Lands Between is positively brimming with riches, intrigue, and danger at every turn. Much of what Elden Ring\u2019s open world does well can be traced directly back to things that made Breath of the Wild stand out from the many open-world games that came before it. (The PC version of Elden Ring also unfortunately borrows some of Breath of the Wild\u2019s stuttery framerate woes). It\u2019s that same feeling of starting out in a world with little explicit guidance, finding something that piques your curiosity on your own, doing whatever it takes to get there, and then being rewarded for that curiosity. In Elden Ring, very rarely did my predictions come true. \u201c The big difference is that in Breath of the Wild I could usually predict what\u2019s going to happen when I get to that orange glowy thing off in the distance. I\u2019ll do a puzzle, unearth a shrine, do another puzzle, and probably get a cool temporary weapon and a spirit orb. That\u2019s not to take anything away from Breath of the Wild \u2013 it was awesome, but that pattern became somewhat routine well before the end. In Elden Ring, by contrast, very rarely did my predictions come true. I\u2019d head to a lake and all of a sudden get ambushed by a dragon, follow a river expecting to collect some minor crafting materials only to find a dungeon filled with enemies and traps, enter a cave and get ambushed by little goblin men, or take a seemingly unimposing elevator and find that it just keeps going down further and further and further\u2026 until eventually I found myself not in a small dungeon but one of its many awe-inspiring new regions. Best of all, each of these little excursions rewards your curiosity with something worthwhile. That could be a new weapon, a new Ash of War, a valuable consumable, a new creature for you to summon, a new spell, or a new NPC to talk to. There are so many valuable rewards available that I never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took. I never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took. \u201c FromSoftware makes all of this especially painless thanks to a number of uncharacteristically friendly features. There\u2019s a generous fast-travel system with a ton of points strewn all across the map; a marker system that lets you drop points on the map to denote things like NPCs, boss locations, out-of-reach treasure, materials, and more; and a speedy spectral horse named Torrent that allows you to quickly cover ground and easily mount and dismount as the situation requires. Elden Ring: PS5 vs Xbox Series X | S - Performance Review Elden Ring pushes some improvements in model quality, scene density, lighting, effects, and more compared to FromSoftware\u2019s previous games. From a technical perspective, it is certainly up there with the best that team has made, even if the framerate can never reliably hit the 60fps cap it has set for itself. The Series S does lose out in such a GPU-heavy game, with basic level of detail culling being a key area the engine doesn\u2019t do well. Buildings can stay visible and not swap to a reduced polygonal model or simply removed from render when far away, half-rate animations can still crop up at long distances on all platforms, and the rocky performance means Framerate mode and Quality mode aren\u2019t as differentiated as they should be. If you have the choice then PS5 is the best all round option in all modes and game areas, but the Series X still offers a welcome boost over the previous gen and is never far behind enough to cause great concern. And while it\u2019s not as smooth as it should be by modern standards, if you played Dark Souls back on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, then this is a silky-smooth affair by comparison. - Michael Thompson, March 3, 2022 Read the full Elden Ring Performance Review But the thing that\u2019s most impressive about Elden Ring is that, in between all of this brilliant open world design, there are also a handful of Legacy Dungeons that still deliver those \u201cwide linear\u201d levels that Souls fans have come to expect. These are gigantic castles, forts, manors, underground labyrinths, and more that are packed with secret areas, challenging bosses, and multiple paths that are linked via one-way shortcut doors. If they were strung all together without being tied to an open world, they could probably exist on their own as Dark Souls 4. Bottom line: Elden Ring\u2019s open-world exploration is a new benchmark. It\u2019s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go \u201cHoly shit\u201d in a host of different ways. It\u2019s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go \u201cHoly shit.\u201d \u201c As far as combat goes, Elden Ring is certainly closest to Dark Souls 3 when compared to other games in FromSoftware\u2019s library of action-RPGs, characterized by weighty attacks, careful stamina management, and a bit of a slower pace than games like Bloodborne and Sekiro. The two big new additions are the ability to use a guard counter by blocking an attack with your shield and immediately pressing the strong attack button to follow up with a crushing strike that can leave weaker enemies in a crumpled state, and a jump attack which gives melee weapon wielders a new type of heavy attack that can also be used to stun enemies and leave them open for a critical hit. Every 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given 66 Images They\u2019re both great additions that offer melee classes fun new tools, but for the most part, FromSoftware has certainly adopted an \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d approach. What really makes the combat in Elden Ring so good though is its enemy design and variety. Not only are a fair number of them horrifying (not quite up to Bloodborne levels of grotesquerie, but still some weapons-grade nightmare fuel) but some of these baddies are absolutely vicious, coming at you with wild swings and combos that seemingly go on forever and can hit from 10 feet away. Others are more methodical and hide behind their shields to wait for the right opportunity to either parry you or catch you while you\u2019re winding up. Others still are weak, but can be huge threats when they ambush you with a grab that kills in one hit. Many are designed to punish those who just mash the dodge-roll button without care, which makes Elden Ring a very hard game, but it\u2019s a good style of difficulty; one that\u2019s less about fast reaction speeds and twitch reflexes (though those certainly help) and more about learning, adapting, and finding the planted weaknesses in an enemy\u2019s attack patterns. Deciphering those tells and acting upon each moment of opportunity is a large part of why these games are so much fun. And then there are the bosses. I don\u2019t want to spoil them, but there are a handful that are some of the most visually and mechanically impressive FromSoftware has ever crafted. Some of the later ones got really close to crossing the line in terms of what I\u2019d deem fair and reasonable when it comes to life-restoring second phases after already brutally tough first phases and two or three-against-one handicap battles, but fortunately, as mentioned before, any walls I hit were surmountable once I took the time to do something else and come back stronger.

A map of Mexico that\u2019s bigger, higher, and wildly more varied than any Horizon game yet. A fresh change to the way the Horizon Festival itself is gradually constructed, which results in more one-off events deliberately designed to showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. Improved tools that allow us to build completely custom events that can be more or less indistinguishable from those crafted by the developers themselves. An enormous visual upgrade, especially to lighting, tyre smoke, and dust effects. Hundreds and hundreds of new custom parts, rims, and performance mods, and cars with more character than ever. Drastic sound improvements, better handling, more granular preferences and options, more online activities. It really is incredible across the board. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask To understand just how big Forza Horizon 5 is, we have to briefly look back at Forza Horizon 4, which truly ballooned into an absolute colossus of a racing game back in 2018. Playground Games had taken the impeccable open-world racing of all the Horizon games to date, then stuffed in simulated seasons, a shared-world multiplayer overhaul, and a shift in how the team told their mini automotive stories. But that was day one; Playground then spent another three years cramming in even more things to do. The Festival Playlist, where new activities were available every week. The Eliminator, Horizon\u2019s very clever and effective take on bringing the battle royale format to a racing game. The Super7, where we could participate in custom-built racing, driving, and stunt-based challenges made by others, plus create and share our own. It\u2019s all this and a remarkable amount more. \u201c What\u2019s impressive is that Forza Horizon 5 isn\u2019t just all this airlifted to a different part of the world; it\u2019s that it\u2019s all this and a remarkable amount more. What We Said About Forza Horizon 4 I\u2019ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that\u2019s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can\u2019t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn\u2019t just upped the ante once again; it\u2019s blown the bloody doors off. \u2013 Luke Reilly, September 25, 2018 Score: 9.6 Read the full Forza Horizon 4 review Mexico Pretty The breadth of Playground\u2019s wonderfully diverse map of Mexico is exceptional, and it comes as an extremely exotic and interesting array of environments to get lost in after three years in Horizon 4\u2019s beautiful but broadly more-uniform Britain. Horizon 5\u2019s tapestry of colourful locations and backdrops more closely resembles Horizon 3, but it feels noticeably more extensive than even Playground\u2019s remarkable 2016 riff on Australia. Mexico feels noticeably more extensive than even Playground\u2019s remarkable 2016 riff on Australia. \u201c There\u2019s Baja, where the sun-baked tarmac hugs the coast as the parched, sandy desert blends into the beach, and deep jungle, where muddy tracks criss-cross through ancient temples, abandoned airstrips, and thickets. There\u2019s the charmingly colourful city of Guanajuato and its maze-like network of cobblestone streets and tunnels, contrasted with a sleepy coastal town flanked by the ocean on one side and mangroves on the other. There\u2019s rolling green farmland draped in crops and windswept grass, and also a picturesque gorge that looks like it\u2019s been plucked from a Western movie. There\u2019s the semi-arid desert of the map\u2019s interior, filled with towering cacti and stubborn shrubs, and the high and rocky volcanic peak of Gran Caldera. There\u2019s even a giant stadium for soccer shenanigans. Forza Horizon 5 Biomes 11 Images It\u2019s not exactly a perfect recreation, of course \u2013 as with all Horizon worlds to date it pays no mind to reality, smooshing together a stylised vision of Mexico at its most interesting. The result is a fantastic map \u2013 and the biggest in the series so far by a striking margin. That size is best observed from atop the Gran Caldera Volcano. The Playground Games team has stressed that it\u2019s the highest point in any Horizon game, but you won\u2019t have to take their word for it \u2013 just drive up there and you\u2019ll see how much it dwarfs both Horizon 3\u2019s Blizzard Mountain and Horizon 4\u2019s Fortune Island expansions. The massive elevation change not only provides one of the best roads in the series to date \u2013 a switchback-filled mountain run I expect will become a drift mecca for the sideways squad \u2013 but it\u2019s a killer display of Horizon 5\u2019s immense draw distance. I love games that make me feel small in a vast new space, and Horizon 5 does this very effectively. It\u2019s a killer display of Horizon 5\u2019s immense draw distance. \u201c The garage is just as grand as the map itself, with well over 500 vehicles, and it\u2019s a selection that still handily eclipses all Forza Horizon\u2019s open-world racing rivals. Granted, there isn\u2019t a huge number of cars that are strictly new to the franchise \u2013 and those of us who stuck around Forza Horizon 4 each week for the last few years collecting every new car will have seen the lion\u2019s share of them before \u2013 but Playground has assuaged that slightly with the addition of a lot of new rim options and visual upgrades that may help breathe new life into cars you\u2019ve seen a lot of previously. Changes to the livery editor also see it support higher resolution designs and graphics... but you still can\u2019t place decals on glass, which remains a shame. Between the cars and the map, however, Forza Horizon 5 is barnstormingly gorgeous on both fronts. On Xbox Series X that\u2019s true of both the 4K/30FPS quality mode and the 4K/60FPS performance mode. I\u2019ve been playing mostly on quality mode since the frame rate never, ever wavers in either mode \u2013 remaining rock solid at all times and in all conditions \u2013 but know that the visual concessions in performance mode are generally so small I need to study freeze frames to spot the difference anyhow. It\u2019s tough to pick my favourite visual element of Horizon 5, but think it might just be the drastically better smoke and dust effects \u2013 and especially how light interacts with the particles in the air. It looks brilliant. Open-World Racing Dream Of course, while Forza Horizon 5\u2019s showstopping graphics are sucking most of the oxygen out of the room, there have been so many other improvements to the Horizon formula here it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. The handling tweaks are deceptively extensive, with more authentic ABS braking, a snappier steering sensation, and suspension improvements that have resulted in a more convincing feel off-road. The radically revamped audio is superb, and the amount of cars that now sound blatantly different to each other has exploded. I especially love hearing the changes my performance parts are making to my car\u2019s sound in real-time \u2013 nerdy behaviour which is encouraged by the ability to rev the engine during upgrade work. There have been so many other improvements to the Horizon formula here it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. \u201c Even before launch, the new event-building tools are already resulting in some outstanding and creative courses, races, and activities being shared between early players. With considerably more props and far more granular options than Horizon 4\u2019s building tools, I\u2019m expecting some of the user-generated content for Horizon 5 is going to be mind-bendingly good. A rethink in how the career mode unfolds has seen Playground add a new points system that allows you to take charge of what event hubs and special races you want to prioritise unlocking. These points, or \u201cAccolades,\u201d are awarded for achieving major and minor feats, and essentially function as a dramatically expanded version of the Brick Challenges in Forza Horizon 4\u2019s LEGO expansion. What this has allowed Playground to do is add a handful of additional curated drives to Horizon 5, which it\u2019s dubbed Expeditions. These Expeditions inject a little bit of the flavour of the Horizon series\u2019 fabulous but fleeting opening drive montages back into the main career, where Playground stage manages vehicles, the time-of-day lighting, and the weather for memorable journeys that showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. One has you racing through trees as lightning strikes the ground ahead, while another has you racing up and back down the rumbling volcano as jets of steam break through the ground around you. One Expedition has you racing through trees as lightning strikes the ground ahead. \u201c There\u2019s been some significant multiplayer massaging, too; this time Playground has ditched ranked play for something less pressurised and that won\u2019t penalise you for other people\u2019s bad racing etiquette. Horizon 5\u2019s PvP modes have been grouped under a single umbrella and are now designed to embrace new players as championships progress, meaning that unlike Horizon 4 it seems like we should no longer be marooned in dwindling groups of sore losers that haemorrhage players as races don\u2019t go their way.

It functions similarly to Forzathon Live \u2013 they\u2019re still co-op events where everyone contributes to a common goal \u2013 but there\u2019s a greater variety of events.

        "Content": "I\u2019ve never played a game like Deathloop before. More accurately, I\u2019ve played a lot of games that are a little bit like it \u2013 Dishonored , Hitman , Outer Wilds , and even Dark Souls among them \u2013 but never anything that fits so many interesting ideas together to create something so fascinatingly unique. Its ever-repeating day, doomed to loop until you can break it by murdering eight targets, is a playground for impactful gunplay, absorbing investigation work, satisfying experimentation, and even tense multiplayer standoffs. Developer Arkane Studios \u2019 precise calibration of these pieces make Deathloop an intricately built clockwork machine that doesn\u2019t so much quietly hum, but rather confidently roars. Your eight targets, known as Visionaries, have taken up residence on Blackreef; a cold and grey island made appealingly vibrant by dashes of 1960s fashion, architecture, and technology. Awakening every morning on its freezing shore is your protagonist Colt, a consistently amusing and understandably sweary gunslinger whose amnesia prevents him from knowing how he got here or for how long he\u2019s been looping. Surprisingly for the scenario, there's no ticking clock snapping at your heels as you try to end the cycle by taking all your targets out before the day resets and they\u2019re all resurrected. Deathloop\u2019s smartest decision is to split its day into four time periods \u2013 morning, noon, afternoon, and night \u2013 and you can remain in each of them for as long or as short a time as you\u2019d like. You choose one of Blackreef\u2019s four unique districts to visit in each period, and you can take your time to thoroughly explore and crack some of Deathloop\u2019s most elusive optional secrets without the fear of time running out. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t complications, though. Your targets are spread out across those time periods and locations, so much so it\u2019s initially impossible to kill them all before the day runs out. As such, you need to herd them together so that you can murder more than one at a time. To achieve this, you must conduct an investigation into their lives and schedules that took me roughly 20 hours, uncovering Blackreef\u2019s exciting secrets, learning fascinating details about your adversaries, and eventually concluding by orchestrating a satisfying solution that ensures every single one of them dies before midnight strikes. Despite using a \u201clive, die, repeat\u201d structure, it\u2019s best to think of Deathloop as a temporal metroidvania rather than anything close to a roguelike. Its chief currency is information: as you chase down objectives and unearth new leads, you\u2019ll discover clues that help you to unlock doors and exciting new opportunities in areas you\u2019ve previously visited, both in time and space. Those areas are, in Arkane tradition, intricately detailed and dense with personality. The decrepit Karl\u2019s Bay, with its cavernous, rusting aircraft hangars perfect for staging ambushes in, is home to an obsessive cult that devoutly follows one of the Visionaries. The sleeker Fristad Rock, meanwhile, with its rock \u2018n\u2019 roll club filled with tempting off-limits chambers, provides a fantastic challenge for your infiltration skills. Thrilling discoveries come as you begin to recognise the cause-and-effect connections between times and districts. \u201c Excitingly, the details of the four locations shift depending on the time you visit them. As the day goes on, the island becomes increasingly anarchic as its residents grow rowdier and smash up furniture, graffiti walls, and even crash a car into a building. In the afternoon, a snowstorm redecorates Blackreef with a white blanket, while the evening is host to an exuberant party that dominates the Updaam district. Between these big visual changes are subtle, more meaningful alterations, such as changing enemy patrols, water freezing to provide new pathways, or a secret apartment window that only opens in the afternoon. These changes help create a constant sense of discovery all throughout Deathloop\u2019s day. Once you\u2019ve played through all four time periods, the day resets and you start again. Dying will also send you right back to breakfast time, although Colt\u2019s supernatural abilities allow him to survive death twice per time period, which keeps things fair and provides an opportunity to quickly learn from mistakes without things getting frustrating. Either way, each reset also strips your inventory of every weapon, power, and upgrade you\u2019ve picked up, forcing you to start afresh each day. Saving you from despair is the Infusion system, which allows you to permanently bind items to Colt so that they survive the loop. It requires spending Residuum, a resource found around Blackreef which is rare enough to force considered purchases, but in enough supply that each new loop will consistently bolster your arsenal. This system cleverly encourages you to vary your approach, allowing you to taste Deathloop\u2019s many flavours without committing until you\u2019re ready. Each day involves picking up a new assortment of guns with varying perks from the enemies you chew through, as well as upgrades called Trinkets, by the bucketful. Trinkets, of which there are dozens, allow you to make meaningful alterations to both your weapons and to Colt, such as the ability to reload in an instant or move without making noise. The loop\u2019s cycling buffet of options allows you to discover and test new equipment, which will go on to inspire your Infusion choices. My increasing enamourment with supernatural abilities such as the Force push-like Karnesis, for instance, saw me invest in Trinkets that increased how long I could use them for, and even fuel them with my health should I run out of power. Over time, you\u2019ll build up a collection of your favourite items, from which you choose a loadout before heading into the next location. Deathloop screenshots 35 Images While you may lose equipment at the end of a run, a reset never disrupts your investigation \u2013 you hold onto every single discovery you\u2019ve made so far in your quest log and intel files. This means you rarely have to repeat the same activity twice, which eliminates a frustration many other time-loop games suffer from. Discoveries automatically set new objectives, which unfortunately robs you of the chance to draw your own conclusions but does ensure you\u2019re never exasperated by hidden links. It\u2019s a worthwhile tradeoff that keeps Deathloop moving at a lively pace. There\u2019s a genuine sense that each choice you make helps narrow the search, inch by satisfying inch. \u201c The journey your objectives take you on frequently shines a new light on locations and time periods you\u2019ve visited before, which builds up a rewarding bank of knowledge. You gradually learn shortcuts through buildings, safe havens with health dispensers, and treasure troves that refill with the same violent delights \u2013 punchy weapons or even reliable sources of Residuum \u2013 every day. The most thrilling discoveries come slowly but surely as you begin to recognise the cause-and-effect connections between times and districts, such as when I realised that breaking into a computer in the morning will ensure a door in a different district will be unlocked in the afternoon. After a couple of hours of linear introduction (which do spend a little too long in a tightly controlled tutorial mode), the whole island and time loop is opened up to you to explore as you please \u2013 any district, in any order. You are provided with starting leads for each of the eight Visionaries, which unfold as linear quest lines, but how you pursue them is entirely up to you. You could opt to tug on each new thread as you find them, hopping between leads to cover as much ground as possible in a single loop, which provides a gratifying sense of efficiency. Or you could chase down a single lead, skipping time periods and locations in dogged pursuit of a specific part of the puzzle. This remarkable freedom helps fulfill the investigator fantasy; there\u2019s a genuine sense that each choice you make helps narrow the search, inch by satisfying inch. Since most people on Blackreef are more interested in killing you than chatting, the answers to Deathloop\u2019s murder puzzle are largely discovered in the classic formats of audio diaries, notes, and computer messages. Granted, those are a dime a dozen in just about every game since BioShock , but Arkane has outdone itself here: these are the best I\u2019ve experienced in any game; concise, deeply flavourful, and often surprisingly funny. Via the aggressive messages sent by \u201cAlphaWolf69\u201d, for instance, you\u2019ll quickly learn that one Visionary, Aleksis Dorsey, is a frat boy scumbag whose only rightful place is at the business end of your shotgun. Directly tying objectives to these diaries and messages means each new discovery further develops an authentic antagonistic relationship between you and the Visionaries as you play, rather than having a manufactured one dropped in your lap. Arkane\u2019s deft storytelling hand doesn\u2019t always hold entirely steady, though. If you don\u2019t fully absorb every note and connect the many dots yourself, which is highly possible given the amount of freedom you have, Colt\u2019s personal story \u2013 a fun, twisty history that intertwines with the lives of his targets and acts as Deathloop\u2019s overarching plot \u2013 might not quite come together. And without it, the short concluding chapter can feel not just abrupt, but rather thin. As much as I appreciate Arkane having confidence in us to make these connections ourselves, Colt\u2019s story feels like something that should have been served up in small milestone meals throughout the loops in a way that can\u2019t possibly be missed, rather than scattered like cookie crumbs across the world to be overlooked by those who just want to get on with the next justified murder. Shotgun Symphony The precision engineering of this complex, looping world is held in balance by Deathloop\u2019s combat system, which is a delightfully raucous affair that roars like a dragon with ballistic breath. If you prefer to go loud you can paint the walls with the insides of Blackreef\u2019s violent thugs \u2013 all of whom appear to have fallen out of an Andy Warhol painting \u2013 using a small but well-tuned array of fantastically heavy weapons. Among the best are the Pepper Mill, a sputtering machine gun that feels as if it were wrenched from the undercarriage of a fighter plane, and The Fourpounder, a pistol that fires with the force of a battleship\u2019s cannon made miniature. Despite acquiring these trusty favourites, I constantly found myself switching between the entire armoury as I planned around different tactics. If you\u2019re playing on PS5, as I did, each gun produces a different effect in the DualSense\u2019s triggers and haptic vibrations, generating a deeply enjoyable sense of force with every fight. These guns are joined by a library of Slabs, which are supernatural powers stolen from the corpses of Visionaries. These can be used in combination with your weapons and the environment to approach situations in your preferred manner, and all routes feel robust no matter if you choose to go loud or quiet. Pairing the teleportation Slab, called Shift, with the invisibility of Aether, for example, allows you to zip up to the rafters and observe enemy paths unseen, picking off stragglers with a silenced nail gun. The Karnesis Slab, meanwhile, can be used to levitate groups and repeatedly slam them into walls until there\u2019s no life left in them. Adding to the Slabs\u2019 value are upgrades, such as the ability to chain your teleport with a kick that\u2019s so powerful it causes a sonic boom \u2013 which are acquired by looting the same Slab multiple times. This provides a strong reason to revisit your targets over and over to claim their Slabs, should the hilariously brutal neck-snap melee kill not be enough encouragement. The right combination can create a whole new playstyle. \u201c The links between your weapons and powers make Deathloop\u2019s combat (or avoidance thereof) a hotbed for joyful experimentation. The system truly comes alive, though, when you learn how Trinkets can harmonise the individual components of your loadout. The right combination can create a whole new playstyle: you might become a hands-off hacker capable of remotely locking down rooms and take out targets with gun turrets that heal you with each kill; or perhaps a master navigator who can double-jump up onto balconies and magically switch places with enemies; or a telekinetic tank with ocean-deep ammunition reserves and a health bar that never seems to run out. This has a deck-building appeal to it, as you mix and match your inventory to craft kits tailored for delightful shootouts, sneaky infiltrations, or a hybrid of the two. Over time, you\u2019ll develop a character build refined in anticipation of the final, perfect loop. How you you like to play games like Deathloop, Dishonored, and Deus Ex? Loud and aggressive Sly and sneaky No alarms, no kills Hacking Other (tell us in the comments) Answer See Results Does that sound too easy? There is, of course, a catch. Doing her best to ensure you never make it as far as the final loop is Julianna Blake, the only Visionary who ever takes a direct interest in Colt and operates on his level. She constantly chats with you over the radio, and your boisterous banter with her imbues this complex, mechanical game with an endearingly human personality. \u201cIf you don\u2019t try to break the loop,\u201d she taunts, \u201cI\u2019m just going to kill you over and over again in increasingly violent ways until you do!\u201d Colt breaks her off; \u201cFine! I\u2019ll break your f***ing loop, and whatever I did to p**s you off, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d It\u2019s said with such comically coarse delivery that Colt instantly proves himself a worthy antithesis to the largely silent protagonists of other Arkane games. Combat is a delightfully raucous affair that roars like a dragon with ballistic breath. \u201c But the biggest difference between Julianna and her peers is that where the other Visionaries will only get aggressive if you invade their home turf, Julianna is a restless and free-roaming hunter. She\u2019ll seek you out and crash your investigation party, turning up like a miniboss fight out of the blue. For example, after silently killing my first target and all their guards, I turned around to find Julianna inches from my face, blocking the exit in a moment that called back memories of BioShock\u2019s terrifying dentist. The ensuing shootout \u2013 taking place in a hangar rapidly filling with lethal gas \u2013 threatened to send me back to the morning without any of the cool treasure I\u2019d scooped up that day. Julianna\u2019s enhanced aggression, resilience, and ability to disguise herself as generic enemies means she\u2019s a welcome tangent in Deathloop\u2019s predictable and repeating patterns. She\u2019s not quite as dangerous as she sounds \u2013 I only actually died by her hand during the earliest stages \u2013 but the alert music that signals her arrival in the area nonetheless drums up some genuine tension every time. That\u2019s the case in single-player mode, at least. Julianna serves a greater purpose, in that she can be controlled by another player who can \u201cinvade\u201d your game to try to thwart you. This twist on the PvP mechanic popularised by Dark Souls turns her into an entirely different beast. Naturally more intelligent than her AI stand-in (or not, I suppose, depending on the person you\u2019re playing against), a \u2018real\u2019 Julianna provides a more authentic sense of cat-and-mouse to the proceedings. This chase is a thrill that not even the few lag spikes I encountered could dampen, and a challenge that turns the ability to replay the loop after the credits have rolled into a much more alluring endgame scenario. Thankfully, if you detest the sound of a randomer jeopardising your perfectly arranged kill, invaders can be entirely locked out of your game, or limited to just friends, with the simple flick of a menu switch. Every Modern IGN 10/10 25 Images From the other perspective, playing as Julianna is similar to controlling Colt, but she has a different rhythm. Without Colt\u2019s resurrection ability, every wrong move could be your last, and you\u2019ll need to kill your target three times to ensure he\u2019s dead for good. It\u2019s a balance that initially seems unfair, but eventually reveals itself to simply be a different kind of battle. Deception becomes the key part of your toolkit; there\u2019s a quiet thrill in switching appearances with an NPC and blending in, doing your best to replicate an AI patrol route (not unlike Watch Dogs \u2019 multiplayer mode). The map knowledge you\u2019ve learned over many loops helps pinpoint ambush locations in places you\u2019ll know Colt is likely heading to, which is a gratifying reward for mastering Deathloop\u2019s level design. My apologies to the person who I repeatedly toyed with in the rock club, invisibly stalking them using vents I\u2019ve discovered on multiple visits to stay two steps ahead. Also see: IGN's full Deathloop Walkthrough Encouraging you through repeat invasions is a \u2018Hunter Rank\u2019 progression system. This can be increased by completing challenges, each of which prompts you to kill Colt in a variety of fun ways. Success unlocks a rapidly growing collection of weapons, powers, and Trinkets for Julianna (she and Colt do not share an inventory), a wardrobe of new looks for both playable characters, and further challenges to complete. PvP is by no means an essential mode, but for anyone as similarly taken by Deathloop\u2019s combat as I am, it\u2019s essentially a rewards system for killing in smart ways."

        "id": "4b0c5d79df50d423b177d06afc9e9b0b",
        "Content": " Like all good detective stories, what appears simple at first becomes so much more than that in Disco Elysium \u2013 and here it gets so, so much weirder, too. It takes the age-old mechanics of tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons and twists them in strange ways around a macabre tale of violence, poverty, and a society on the brink of collapse. Through sharply written dialogue and an expertly crafted world, it uses some unique game mechanics - such as debating against 24 different sections of your own brain - to create a story that will stay with me for a long time. And, somehow, it manages to make all of this fun and, surprisingly often, funny. Now with the addition of a fully voiced cast and even more side quests to embark on, The Final Cut makes an amazing game even better. The premise of Disco Elysium is straightforward: A body has been discovered, hanged from a looming tree in the backyard of a hostel, and it\u2019s up to you to work out how it got there over the course of the 30-hour story. Everything that surrounds this core mystery is far from simple, however, not least being that you kick things off with an almighty dose of hangover-induced amnesia. You can\u2019t even remember your name, let alone that you are a cop on a murder case. A part of your consciousness described as your ancient reptilian brain \u2013 which you literally engage in conversation with \u2013 attempts to persuade you to give up your quest even as your snivelling limbic system battles against it. As you stumble around your wrecked bedroom searching for remnants of your former self, it quickly becomes clear that this isn\u2019t simply a whodunnit, but a journey that will challenge you to solve crises on both profoundly personal and societal levels. It\u2019s a gorgeously designed isometric RPG that makes you think at every turn of its painterly streets. Disco Elysium: 18 Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask  Learn, Baby Learn The first decision you have to make when booting up Disco Elysium is what kind of detective you wish to be: Intelligent (think Sherlock Holmes), Sensitive (think Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks), or Bruiser (think Marv from Sin City). Each determines the base stats for your nameless gumshoe and influences the decisions offered to you from the get-go, but they all offer an interesting way to play. For example, opening with the Intelligent build allows you to instantly decipher that you have woken in the city of Revachol as your high Encyclopedia skill level feeds you that knowledge. Begin with the Sensitive option, however, and you\u2019ll have no idea where you are and will have to piece together that same information. The beauty of Disco Elysium\u2019s skill system is that there\u2019s always a reward for the choices you have made \u2013 a Sensitive might not know where he is, but he can start interrogating his necktie for clues. Yes, really. The beauty of Disco Elysium\u2019s skill system is that there\u2019s always a reward for the choices you have made. \u201c If that isn\u2019t varied enough for you, you can build your own detective from the ground up instead. Your character sheet is made up of four distinct pillars: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics. Each of these consists of six wonderfully strange skills (like Intellect\u2019s Encyclopedia), which bring their own bonuses. Want to command respect from a member of the public? Spend points on Authority. How about intimidate a witness? Beef up your Physical Instrument total. Want to talk to that necktie? Start messing with the David Lynch-inspired Inland Empire measurement.   Final Cut - Hearing Yourself Think Disco Elysium - The Final Cut expands its original cast to include fully voiced performances for every character, but none make more of an impact than the 24 different sections of your brain that accompany you throughout your journey. To emphasize just how important they are, roughly half of the more than one million words spoken in this sprawling RPG belong to your character\u2019s innermost thoughts. Voicing all two dozen of these cerebral incarnations is jazz musician Lenval Brown, who masterfully breathes new life into ZA/UM\u2019s tome of a script. His bass-heavy, calming yet authoritative voice guides you as much as it does educate you on the world of Revachol. The casting for this role was always going to be crucial to the success of The Final Cut, but after hearing the gravitas and depth Brown brings to it, it\u2019s hard to imagine Disco Elysium any other way.  These skills aren\u2019t just passive ways of sending you down different paths; each one is a distinct voice in your detective\u2019s head, represented in the dialogue window during conversations. With high Empathy you might get a voice telling you not to push too hard in a victim interrogation, but with high Half Light (a skill that allows your to interrogate suspects with more force) your brain might tell you to just punch them in the face. They\u2019re as much in-game tips as they are a way to gate your progress. You earn another skill point for every 100 XP you gain, collected by checking off tasks from your quest list or by simply having conversations with people and uncovering new information. Leveling up does come fairly infrequently though, so you\u2019ll have to really think about how you want to use them, but it never feels like you\u2019re waiting too long for the next skill point however and feels just about right. The upshot of all this skill management is that Disco Elysium plays like no other video game I\u2019ve ever seen. Its closest analogue is perhaps the outstanding Divinity: Original Sin 2, if you replaced all of its turn-based combat with early-era LucasArts point-and-click scenarios. Puzzle-solving comes hand-in-hand with skill checks, which are interactions based on a combination of a dice roll and your stats. The higher your number for the requisite skill, the higher the percentage you have of rolling successfully. This mechanic is used to resolve everything from conversation options to jumps across ledges, and even violence. The upshot of all this skill management is that Disco Elysium plays like no other video game I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c Hold on though: there is no combat in Disco Elysium, not in the traditional sense anyway. Throwing a punch is a matter of willing your detective to do so, and the consequences are usually verbal rather than physical. For the most part, you\u2019re armed with your (sometimes) silver tongue and a roll of the dice. Your choice of dialogue is often crucial to solving problems, not only when interacting with others, but with the many voices occupying your mind. It\u2019s a truly fun way of dealing with exciting sequences and a welcome breath of fresh air compared to more action-oriented RPGs. I actually found talking my way through situations and building out my character sheet in Disco Elysium much more stimulating than the monotony of slicing down enemies with yet another +2 blade. Clothing positively and negatively affects your skills as well, which will be familiar to those acquainted with Bethesda RPGs. By putting on a replica hat worn by fictional detective Dick Mullen you can boost your Encyclopedia score by 1. Quick costume changes can come in handy when faced with a dice roll that looks too difficult at first glance. I once found myself confronted by a mural in an especially seedy part of town which required a substantial amount of Shivers \u2013 a skill that lets you \u201craise the hair on your neck\u201d and \u201ctune into the city\u201d to decipher your environment. My character naturally had a low Shivers stat, but by putting on a pair of fancy shades and changing my jacket I soon had enough to make the percentage likelihood of my roll a tempting 72%. I went for it, got lucky, and swiftly changed back into my preferred getup. These are the moments when a little lateral thought is needed, each one serving as a mini-puzzle where you try to build up your stats with what resides in your inventory. You can also boost yourself by consuming alcohol or taking drugs, such as speed. These temporarily boost a whole pillar of your character sheet for an in-game hour, but come at the expense of your health or morale. I never really felt that this came at much of a risk, however, so I ended up consuming narcotics with regularity in order to gain that welcome boost up over the fence. In truth, I never had to play around with my inventory very often and wished I had more reason to do so. I found myself sticking with the same outfit for large portions of the adventure and yearned at times for a bit more challenge. Luckily, Disco Elysium has such a strong central story driving it along that I ultimately didn\u2019t miss the lack of difficulty. Luckily, Disco Elysium has such a strong central story driving it along that I ultimately didn\u2019t miss the lack of difficulty. \u201c Other than increasing your skills, you can also spend points in your Thought Cabinet, a unique mechanic that turns abstract concepts like Communism, memories of favourite flavours, or just mistakenly thinking you\u2019re a rockstar into a kind of mental inventory. It plays beautifully into the theme that half of the battle in Disco Elysium takes place in your mind. By internalizing a thought unlocked along your travels you can earn a variety of rewards attached to it. These vary from stat boosts to XP boosts and unique traits. They can also come with some major downsides, but part of the fun is not knowing what benefits you might get from ruminating on something like the \u201cVolumetric Shit Compactor\u201d for a while. For example, after seven hours gestating one thought called \u201cThe Wompty-Dompty Dom Centre\u201d, I received a perk that gave me 10 XP every time I successfully used my Encyclopedia stat in conversation, but also lowered my Suggestion stat by two points because I\u2019m a \u201cpretentious wanker,\u201d according to my own brain. It\u2019s a wonderfully odd system, not least because each time you complete a thought a new and stunningly grotesque illustrative painting fills your screen, echoing Francisco Goya\u2019s \u201cBlack Paintings\u201d period \u2013 which is to say, they are laden with disturbing imagery reflecting a bleak outlook on humanity.  On the Beat Society seems a concept long since forgotten in the city of Revachol, the once-proud capital of the world you wake up in. Martinaise, the district where you\u2019ll spend most of your time, is an impoverished hub of anger and discontent, but it\u2019s a captivating place to be. On the surface, no one appears happy here, perhaps apart from the few who grasp tightly onto power with a greedy fist. It\u2019s a beautifully realised depiction of a firmly ugly place \u2013 you instantly get a sense of the world you\u2019ll spend upwards of 30 hours trawling through; snow falls softly onto abandoned vehicles, crumbling, neglected architecture haunts the streets, and broken statues commemorating a long-fabled war serve as a reminder of what happened here.   Final Cut - Vision Quest One of the most impactful additions in The Final Cut are the Political Vision Quests. These four optional objectives are mutually exclusive, meaning you\u2019ll only get to see one of them per playthrough. They are tied to the political leanings you\u2019ve shown during the story and add roughly 20-30 minutes of enjoyable new detective work. While not directly affecting the outcome of the main storyline, they do a great job of teaching you more about the world and quirky characters of Revachol, one of the main draws of Disco Elysium already. The original release included a lot of political theory and many of the dialogue choices you made influenced your characters leanings, from fascist to liberal and everything in between. However, there never felt like there was any sort of payoff or closure to whichever path you took. The Final Cut provides exactly what was missing by adding these quest lines late in the story, allowing you to fully commit to a branch of ideological thinking. In my playthrough of The Final Cut I chose to embrace Communism, which culminated in a bizarre, bewildering, and ultimately enriching conversation with two new characters I wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise. Revachol and its socio-political history were always one of the key strengths of Disco Elysium, so naturally I was more than happy to delve deeper into that while simultaneously being given more opportunities to build out my protagonist and find his place in the world.  To deduce the stories the city has to tell (and there\u2019s quite a few) you\u2019ll have to be thorough, using all of your character\u2019s faded detecting abilities as they slowly come back to him. Small, coloured information orbs are littered across the environment, inviting you to click on them all to squeeze every drop of knowledge out of the deeply layered world. Not everything will be relevant to your cause, but it will always be interesting. This is testament to the world that developer ZA/UM has created in Disco Elysium \u2013 rarely has a place sucked me in quite like the city of Revachol did. It ranks up there with the likes of The Witcher 3\u2019s colourful Continent or Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s rugged West, despite taking place over a much smaller area. Disco Elysium: 19 Pieces of Concept Art 19 Images The density of a game\u2019s world can sometimes feel overwhelming, with maps dominated by icons and large areas of land beckoning to be explored. This is never the case with Disco Elysium; there\u2019s lots to do, but it encourages you to take your time and absorb all the information you are being fed at your own pace. Whether you choose to take what you find at face value is for you to decide; You\u2019re a detective, after all. You\u2019ll probably want to click every prompt as well, and it\u2019s hard to miss any due to the extremely useful ability to highlight any clickable item on the screen by holding Tab (something not uncommon to veterans of the adventure genre). Although sometimes deliberately obtuse in its dialogue and the way certain things are worded, crucially Disco Elysium never clouds what you\u2019re meant to be doing. Tasks are clearly listed in the menu with a generous amount of hinting as to what you\u2019re aiming to achieve; it\u2019s an incredibly dense experience with my list of tasks quickly growing, but one I never felt bogged down in. Each new face is accompanied by a gorgeously painted portrait that looks as if it\u2019s been stroked onto a canvas by a hopped-up Francis Bacon. \u201c Core to this is Disco Elysium\u2019s varied cast of characters and the way their stories intertwine with both your own and that of the world they inhabit. Each new face is accompanied by a gorgeously painted portrait that looks as if it\u2019s been stroked onto a canvas by a hopped-up Francis Bacon. Every one feels fully formed and it\u2019s clear to see from a quick look at their face or a few sentences in their company what their background is. They range from Cuno, a foul-mouthed boy who finds pleasure in throwing rocks at your subject\u2019s suspended corpse (he is, frankly, a little shit) to Evrart Claire, a slimy union boss who looks cut from the same cloth as Jabba the Hutt. It\u2019s rare to meet a kind face in Revachol, which makes it all the more special when you actually find yourself connecting to someone and having a conversation that actually borders on the polite... Chief among these connections is the one you\u2019ll forge with your partner in crime-fighting, Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, a policeman brought in from another precinct to help with the case. You are strangers at first, and he can come across as cold and suspicious of your methods. But I enjoyed watching your bond form as the stakes continue to heighten. Kitsuragi\u2019s dry humour and analytic mind is brought to life brilliantly in his voice acting and provides a reassuring tone during tense moments.   Final Cut - Finding a Voice Every person you meet in Martinaise is now fully voiced, and it can\u2019t be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the original. The 2019 release did feature limited voicing of some characters, and the inconsistent quality of these performances was one of my few criticisms of Disco Elysium when I reviewed it then \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t be happier with the results this time around. A couple of cast members remain, most notably those playing larger roles like Kim Kitsuragi and Evrat Claire, while others that had only partially voiced roles have been changed. These include Cuno, who\u2019s new performance still carries the obnoxious essence of the character, but is nowhere near as grating on the ears as it once was. Practically all of the newly added cast members hit the mark as well, breathing new life into the world of Disco Elysium and further reinforcing the diversity that can be found in the city with a globe-full of accents and languages. The biggest compliment I can pay to the vocal additions is that all of the characters sounded exactly how I imagined they would when I first played. It mirrored the joy I get from first hearing an audiobook or film adaptation of one of my favourite novels, with the voices I once solely heard in my head finally played back to me.  The dialogue itself is meticulously written. It\u2019s bitingly funny at times, leaning into the darkness of your situation while also not being afraid to let you know when you\u2019ve made a stupid mistake. It\u2019s willing to be a cynical step into much darker, serious themes as many people in Revachol hold racist and fascist beliefs and are not afraid to let you know. Characters will swing from revolutionary prose calling for the fall of the bourgeoisie into Kafka-esque psychoanalytic ramblings. They are topics that expand and enrich the mind, giving you cause to question your character\u2019s place in the world as well as your own. Disco Elysium is as much an exercise in detective fantasy as it an evaluation of your own socio-political leanings. Disco Elysium is as much an exercise in detective fantasy as an evaluation of your own socio-political leanings. \u201c There are two main plotlines to the story of Disco Elysium: the murder case you have been sent to Revachol to solve, and a more personal journey as you attempt to piece together your past and find out who you really are. These are both woven in and out like a poisonous vine by the societal issues at play in the city. There\u2019s little else I can say about the plot without spoiling too much of the mystery \u2013 I urge you to discover the tale for yourself. With the sheer number of twists and branches it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll end up with a different end result than I did, anyhow. There are still a couple of key dice rolls that didn\u2019t land in my favour that I can\u2019t wait to go back and retry, just to see how differently it all could have gone. Ultimately, I was satisfied with the ending I got, even if I did leave a bit more of a mess behind me than I desired. It\u2019s always difficult to put a bow on a story that promises so much, but Disco Elysium achieves its goal, even if I was left waiting for that one more twist, that one more revelation. Over the course of its 30 hours I couldn\u2019t stop reading everything I picked up, learning more about the world I was in and the people that were suffering in it. If this seems all a bit much for you though, there is always the option to just give up. 15 minutes in I received my first game over screen after having a meltdown and giving into the murmurings of my ancient reptilian brain. Yes, Disco Elysium is definitely weird, and by no means a feel-good experience, but it's a highly smart one that I can\u2019t wait to relive. "

Hailing from a meager tribe in what would be modern Sudan (eastern Africa), she restored the organized worship of the ancient Egyptian gods and cemented the rule of a new pharaonic dynasty in the medieval Nile Valley, finally ending centuries of foreign rule. Her passion in life, however, was her 12 children, some of whom would go on to rule in their own right. Raising that many kids is stressful, though, which led her to develop a drinking habit and a taste for elaborate feasts, ultimately ingratiating her in the eyes of her more revelrous subjects even further. This is just one of the countless human stories that emerged organically over more than 100 hours I\u2019ve already spent in Crusader Kings 3. And its marriage of the personal and the political, the grand and the intimate, is nothing short of glorious. Crusader Kings has always been a series about how individual characters, and their interactions, shape history, and this third installment finds new and intriguing ways to portray that. Like its predecessors, Crusader Kings 3 lets court drama, dynastic feuds, and marriage alliances underpin the more familiar grand strategy game tasks of constructing castles, researching technology, and waging war. A personal slight between two neighboring rulers can plunge the entire region into bloodshed and chaos worthy of a great historical fiction novel, while a well-planned betrothal can forge a mighty alliance and eventually unite kingdoms under one crown. Fundamentally, it\u2019s a game more about people than things \u2013 and that focus is what makes it truly special and memorable. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Paradox Development Studio has deepened and expanded upon most of the key elements that made Crusader Kings 2 work. The stress system, which led our merry matriarch Hamam to find solace in the bottom of a bottle, is emblematic of this. In Crusader Kings 2, characters have personality traits that affect their stats, but they didn\u2019t do much to guide your behavior. In Crusader Kings 3, a cruel character will build up stress if you often offer your enemies mercy, while an honest one will chafe at dark dealings in the shadows. This encouraged me to roleplay the traits of my characters rather than just seeing them as numerical modifiers, or live with the consequences of denying their natural tendencies, which I really enjoyed. Understandably, Crusader Kings 3\u2019s system doesn\u2019t feel as broadly fleshed-out as its predecessor\u2019s, which has had the benefit of seven years and hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of expansions, but it\u2019s well on its way. Developing a temper could lead to you punching out a priest and upsetting the Pope, which is generally a bad idea. \u201c Stress encouraged me to roleplay the traits of my characters rather than just seeing them as numerical modifiers. Stress never felt like it railroaded me into a specific kind of behavior, though. Accumulating too much leads to a mental break, which offers you the choice of a couple different coping mechanisms you can adopt to deal with the strain of ruling a medieval realm. Whether it\u2019s drinking, fighting, or frequenting the brothels, each of these provides authentic-feeling character development and introduces new opportunities for drama and conflict. Hamam\u2019s love of booze led her to make new friends with other magnates who shared in her favored pastime. But developing a temper could lead to you punching out a priest and upsetting the Pope, which is generally a bad idea in this time period. What We Said About CK3: Royal Court DLC Whether I'm creating new melting pot cultures, decorating my throne room, or throwing lavish parties to make sure everyone remembers how important I am, Royal Court goes beyond tacking on some new mechanics to the already excellent Crusader Kings 3. It weaves iron into the very fibers of the base game and makes it feel more complete and cohesive. And rather than focus on one region, all the pillars and ethoses added by the new culture system make it feel like a flavor pack for the entire world. It's the best kind of grand strategy expansion, and while it leaves dukes and tribal rulers feeling a bit left out in the rain as they can't access most of these new systems, I wouldn't want to ever play without it. - Leana Hafer, February 8, 2022 Score: 9 Read the full Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court DLC Review Of course, due to the in-depth, free-form new religion system, you can always bid farewell to a religious doctrine that no longer suits you. You can create a new heresy of Catholicism that, for instance, exalts cannibalism, believes in reincarnation, and allows only women to become priests. Everything is customizable, from the role of the clergy to views on witchcraft and homosexuality. The possibilities are practically limitless, and allow you to customize your experience and leave your mark on the world in very satisfying ways that were never possible in the previous games. Master of Whisperers Medieval dynastic politics would be nothing without a little cloak and dagger, and this is another area where Crusader Kings 3 has gone all out. A new system of secrets and hooks allows you to gain leverage over other characters by, for instance, discovering and threatening to expose an extramarital affair. It feels rewarding and viable to work solely in the shadows, building your base of power through trading favors, manipulating the careless, and assassinating those too inconvenient to your schemes. Most of the same results were achievable in Crusader Kings 2, but the way you get there is so much richer and more hands-on now. Crusader Kings 3 Screenshots 14 Images Warfare has some strong new ideas too, well beyond the advantage bar that clearly shows you who\u2019s winning a battle at any given moment (a huge improvement over Crusader Kings 2\u2019s arcane and inaccessible number-crunching). While combat is still fairly simple and hands-off, from a tactical perspective, the ways it can have repercussions after the fact have been greatly broadened and deepened beyond simple success or failure. The addition of Knights gives individual, named warriors a bigger role to play in turning the tide, and more opportunities for personal stories to emerge from the din of clashing steel. What\u2019s more, the risks of bloodshed now include consequences that can be more shattering to a ruler than losing an entire army. A lover serving in your personal guard might sacrifice themselves to save you from a stray arrow. A close but bloody battle, even if you emerge victorious, could end with all of your adult children, your most trusted counselor, and your best friend dead or maimed. The survivors will be left to return to a completely changed political situation and atmosphere at court while possibly sending your current avatar into a depression spiral full of angst and debauchery. Martial Management The logistics of conducting a campaign of conquest could still use some work. In an effort to cut down on the micromanagement that bogs down Crusader Kings 2 at times, Crusader Kings 3 has all of your armies arrive at a designated rally point as a single force, rather than raising dozens of small stacks from their home counties and having to merge them together. The problem is it doesn\u2019t always send troops where they\u2019re needed, this often leaves you without the fine control you need to stage your invasion efficiently. Setting up multiple rally points is supposed to split your forces somewhat evenly when you call up the banners, but I\u2019ve never found this to work properly in practice. Usually one rally point would spawn a small contingent of troops, while the entire rest of my army showed up at the other. This is pretty annoying, because having too many troops in one spot will cause you to lose men and supplies to attrition, and in a war with multiple fronts it leaves one or more positions woefully undermanned. The end result is that you end up doing almost as much work micromanaging your soldiers, manually splitting them into smaller contingents and marching them halfway across the realm, as you would have under the old system. What lifestyle are you most excited to try out in Crusader Kings 3? Martial - Taste my steel! Intrigue - I rule from the shadows! Learning - Unlock the mysteries of the cosmos! Stewardship - Make it rain ducats! Diplomacy - Talk softly and carry a big sword! Answer See Results This is partly alleviated by the fact that there\u2019s so much to do besides marching armies around, and all of that is done so well. But it\u2019s the one major thing I\u2019d really want to see improved, and I take comfort from the fact that Paradox has a rock-solid history of polishing its games for years after launch. This is easily Paradox\u2019s best looking game to date, across the board. The graphics don\u2019t need any polishing though. This is easily Paradox\u2019s best looking game to date, across the board. I couldn\u2019t have anticipated how much having fully 3D, animated character models would help the world and stories come to life, but it makes an absolutely massive difference over Crusader Kings 2. And it\u2019s more nuanced than you\u2019d probably expect, in that you get to see your characters age gradually year over year in complex and realistic ways, rather than suddenly getting gray and wrinkly at a pre-set age like in the previous installment. On top of that, the new DNA system allows children to be a believable mix of their parents\u2019 features, with the ability to pass on everything from hair color to nose bridge width to ear lobe size. Paradox has a rock-solid history of polishing its games for years after launch. \u201c The historically-inspired clothing is a joy to look at, from the roughspun tunics of a Swedish commoner to the elaborate, embellished court dress of the Byzantine Emperor. I do wish there was a little more regional variation \u2013 my pharaohs were stuck with fairly generic Arabic-looking outfits, for instance \u2013 but that\u2019s something I\u2019d bet strongly on getting more of in updates, mods, and DLC down the line. And the portrait system can even model things like scars from battles, weight gain from too much wine and feasting, athleticism, and the signature buboes of everyone\u2019s favorite plague. Characters have always been the mechanical heart of Crusader Kings, but making them its visual focus in so many new and effective ways elevates everything else substantially. Royal Edition For $25 extra, you can gain some bonus outfits for the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate that decks out characters in the general area of Arabia and Mesopotamia with shiny new threads. But more importantly, you\u2019ll get an expansion pass for the first three DLCs. We don\u2019t know what these are yet, but based on the launch pricing of past Paradox DLCs, $25 for three is a steal even if you\u2019re not thrilled about the fashions of medieval Baghdad. Said expansions can vary in quality from amazing to just okay, but there aren\u2019t any from the last few years that I would flatly recommend not picking up. It\u2019s probably worth the cash if you were planning to buy those DLCs individually at launch, though sales on older DLCs might allow you to nab them cheaper, eventually, if you don\u2019t mind waiting quite a while. The map is gorgeous to look at as well, fading seamlessly from an era-appropriate parchment mode at higher zoom levels to highly detailed and striking close-ups of terrain at the lowest ones. It\u2019s very easy when maneuvering to see where features like hills, swamps, and forests start and end without having to rely on the UI, which is a huge boon for tactics and immersion when on a campaign. And using zoom levels instead of discrete map modes that must be toggled on and off (though there are a few of those) allows you to access the information you need much more quickly and intuitively at a moment\u2019s notice. The interface is generally clean and well-organized, using a dusky but not depressing color palette that\u2019s easy to look at and feels decidedly medieval without casting a sense of gloom all over everything. Hand-painted backgrounds on events and character pages enhance the atmosphere and sense of place, from a chieftain\u2019s smoky tent on the Eurasian steppe to a Sultan\u2019s elaborate, ostentatious palace grounds. It can get a little busy at times, though, due to the fact that Crusader Kings 3 seemingly wants to avoid overlapping menus as much as possible. If you open the intrigue screen, for instance, it shoves everything that\u2019s normally along the right hand side over to the left instead of covering it up. If you have a lot of menus and notifications going on at once, you can be left with what feels like basically a postage stamp of the map left to peer at and it sometimes made me feel very claustrophobic. Too much information at a glance can be a bad thing, so you have to learn to manage it. Every music track is excellent and effective. \u201c Every music track is excellent and effective. The soundtrack and sound design is also a new high for Paradox Development Studio. Ambient sounds like a bustling market or the clash of swords in battle at the lowest zoom levels are crisp, layered, and effective at reinforcing that sense of place. Every music track is excellent and effective, whether it be a serene and ambient bed of strings or the bombastic, energetic contextual stings that play when you declare war or being a crusade. Even little things like the clicky feedback noises you get from clicking on menu options are great. Subtleties like that can go a long way. When you design your own religion in Crusader Kings 3, what are you going to put in your holy scriptures? Cannibalism is a virtue. Does this guy taste funny to you? Legalize witchcraft. Throw up the horns! Gnosticism. What if this \u201cGod\u201d guy isn\u2019t who He says He is? Mandatory nudity. Yes, that\u2019s a real option. Answer See Results All of this is sealed with the slick, regal wax of the new lifestyles system, which takes the ideas of Crusader Kings 2\u2019s best add-on, Way of Life, and expands on it excellently while folding it into the base mechanics. Characters can choose to focus on one of five areas: war, intrigue, learning, diplomacy, and stewardship. Each of these has three distinct and rich sub-focuses within them. Does your scheming duke want to get his way through murder or seduction? Both can accomplish the same goals, but in very different ways. And each is loaded with new events, almost none of which are repeats that those of us who played Crusader Kings 2 to death will recognize. And since so many of them are specific to one focus within one lifestyle, I imagine it\u2019s going to take a very long time to see them all even once. At around 100 hours played, I\u2019m still getting tons of novel events pop up at my court and it feels like I\u2019ve only scratched the surface. Power and Progression Lifestyles also come with three talent trees that don\u2019t only give you boring, flat modifiers to your skills, but actually open up entirely new playstyles. A skilled diplomat who is a vassal to a higher ruler, for instance, can unlock the ability to claim the throne of their liege lord even if they have no right to it by blood. Seedy schemers can gain the ability to abduct other characters and take them prisoner, up to and including kings and popes! On top of this, you\u2019ll be accumulating Renown for your whole dynasty, which can unlock bonuses like making everyone in your line longer-lived or more likely to inherit positive genetic traits like Strong and Intelligent. This means that while each new ruler you inhabit might be a fresh start in terms of lifestyle points, you\u2019ll always be accumulating dynastic progress that never goes away. It\u2019s really satisfying, and one of those things I\u2019m now realizing was painfully missing from Crusader Kings 2. Every 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given 66 Images The new technology system is another great example of improving on this idea of long-term progression. While Crusader Kings 2\u2019s system was full of more of those boring, flat modifiers \u2013 a small bonus to prestige here, an increase to the fighting effectiveness of heavy infantry there \u2013 almost all of Crusader Kings 3\u2019s historically-inspired innovations give you something new and exciting to play with. It\u2019s how you unlock new succession laws that allow you to consolidate power under one heir, rather than having the kingdom split between all your kids when you die. The latter system makes the early game very chaotic and challenging, and by the time you get rid of it, you feel like you\u2019ve really earned it. It will also unlock new buildings and culture-specific military units and abilities for just about every corner of the map. Mongols get deadly horse archers. Norse longships will allow you to sail along major rivers, not just the open seas. In a tapestry where regional variation is one of the few colors that isn\u2019t as bright, these little touches really help each region in Crusader Kings 3\u2019s feel somewhat new and different."

        "Content": "The Last of Us is one of the rare beloved games of the past decade that not only didn\u2019t demand a sequel, but actively seemed to resist the idea of one. Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original\u2019s third-person action/stealth gameplay. I can\u2019t tell you much about some of Part 2\u2019s best aspects, but not because I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I\u2019m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I\u2019ll speak about its story in largely general terms. One of Part 2\u2019s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead. Ellie\u2019s journey grows into something much more ambitious. \u201c From there, Ellie\u2019s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us\u2019 powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2\u2019s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original.   Should I Play The Last of Us Before Part 2?  I\u2019m going to talk about the events of the original The Last of Us a bit going forward, so if you haven\u2019t played it yet please bail out and go do that immediately. Not only because it\u2019s still an outstanding game, but playing through the original before Part 2 \u2013 especially relatively soon before \u2013 will make its big moments resonate so much more. Part 2 doesn\u2019t necessarily rely on your ability to recall specific events and conversations, but it did play off the lingering emotions I\u2019ve felt since playing the original.  In Your Opinion, Is The Original The Last of Us a 10/10? Yes! No Answer See Results  One of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won\u2019t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog\u2019s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you\u2019re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself. Part 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I\u2019d watched it all unfold in a movie.  Preorder The Last of Us Part 2   See it at Best Buy  See it at Amazon  See it at GameStop    I Am Not Alone, Dear Loneliness At the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie\u2019s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up. The Last of Us Part 2 Review Screenshots 26 Images Baker is no less fantastic as Joel, even though Ellie is in the more prominent playable role. However you may feel about Joel\u2019s decisions in the original, Baker sells the weariness of a man who has taken many lives to save his own and made questionable moral decisions out of love. Seeing him reckon with a surrogate daughter who both cares for him and yet keeps him at arm\u2019s length is devastating to watch. Taking a cue from 2014\u2019s prequel expansion, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Part 2 allowed me to live in moments between Joel and Ellie, which offered up a quiet reflection of why they view the world they do. Even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate as Joel's or Ellie's. \u201c Part 2 also introduces a great cast of supporting characters. Shannon Woodward is instantly charming as Dina, bringing a joy and kindness to a world where it\u2019s otherwise so tough to find. Woodward shines in the smaller moments \u2014 a joking jab at Ellie here or an amusing aside about their Jackson homestead, there \u2014 offering so much dimension to the character. It\u2019s also important to highlight, in spoiler-free terms, the incredible performance by Laura Bailey (known for her roles as Mary Jane from Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man and Kait Diaz from Gears 5, among numerous others) as a new character. Like so many of The Last of Us\u2019 characters, calling her good or evil would be reductive \u2013 we see her at her best and most relatable as well as her worst. It\u2019s a testament to The Last of Us Part 2\u2019s script by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross and Bailey\u2019s performance that even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate and arguably noble as Joel\u2019s or Ellie\u2019s. It takes a deft hand to write characters like this; those I wanted the best for even if they were doing despicable things. Some of the choices the characters made in Part 2 delighted me, others frustrated me, but I always wanted them to be better, and stronger, and see the goodness in themselves. In this regard, they felt incredibly human. Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review 28 Images The way Naughty Dog uses the larger, community-based conflict between the warring groups in Seattle also helped avoid the fatigue that set in with the latter acts of Uncharted 4. Even though it took me about 25 hours to complete (10 hours longer than the original), Part 2 never dragged or felt padded out thanks to the large cast and Naughty Dog\u2019s efforts to give each of them the screen time and story arc they deserve. Bringing so many perspectives to the forefront beautifully illustrates the larger ideas and conflicts in this world.  I Would Like to Rage Those conflicts play out with some very familiar stealth, action, and puzzle sequences. That said, one of the biggest critiques of the first game is that its combat and puzzle segments weren\u2019t deep enough to avoid repetition over its 15 hours, and Part 2 has taken major steps to remedy that and add variety to gameplay \u2013 some of which seem obvious in hindsight. For example, it\u2019s silly to think that adding a jump button in 2020 could feel so fresh, but it most definitely proves to be key to Part 2\u2019s many enthralling combat encounters. Ellie is far more nimble than Joel, able to jump, swing, and climb over and under things to more carefully avoid or stalk enemies. That not only made my options feel exponentially more varied, but also allowed the level design around these encounters to be more open and diverse at every step. From underground caverns to dilapidated office and apartment buildings to the lush, overgrown streets of a Seattle being reclaimed by nature, Part 2\u2019s stealth combat is easy to understand but consistently exciting to try and master with every new fight. Part of that comes from the scope of its battlefields: they take place in areas like multi-tiered shopping malls or fragmented skyscrapers that offer what feel like naturally complex puzzle boxes. There was always plenty of room, both literally and mechanically, to sneak around and pick off enemies one by one, go in guns blazing, or (as usually happened for me) plan to be stealthy but get caught and scramble to narrowly escape danger. Ellie\u2019s ability to jump, go prone, dodge, and even run away from combat not only takes advantage of these large spaces, but also enables that improvisation within them, pushing you to adapt to any situation or meet a quick death. Enemies don\u2019t just stick to set patterns; they\u2019re reactive to the environment around them. While giving every human enemy a name and the ability to communicate with each other more effectively while searching for you seems somewhat superfluous at first, the practical application of it was always clear after I\u2019d killed an enemy or two in any given fight. The Washington Liberation Front enemies, seeing a friend or loved one dead on the ground, would immediately switch up their search pattern, taking note of recently downed enemies and possible escape routes the killer could have taken from that spot. Simply hearing my enemies verbally work through their plans, rather than just going about their patrol routes, instilled so much more tension into every fight. Learning the ins and outs of each faction added another interesting layer to combat. \u201c Then there are the differences between the factions \u2013 learning the ins and outs of each added another interesting layer to combat. The Seraphites, battling with bows and arrows, use a whistling system to communicate, while the WLF members are more vocal and transparent, but carry a lot more firepower. And the Infected\u2026 well, they haven\u2019t suddenly started talking, but their mob mentality is more threatening than ever. New enemies like the Shambler throw noxious spore bombs that cut off potential escape routes or obscure other enemies. The returning but more prevalent Stalkers are even scarier than before, pulling off a move Drax would be jealous of by making themselves invisible to Ellie\u2019s returning radar-like Listen ability. They\u2019ll use that silence to sneak up behind you, and when one attacks, it often means more are on the way. Fights with them, and a mixture of the many other Infected enemies with different abilities to take into account, led to several encounters that rivaled the best survival-horror experiences out there. This is all to say enemies feel vastly more intelligent and varied in this sequel, and the little details make all the difference in combat: when alerted, enemies will check every inch of a map, including under cars and around each bit of cover, and their increased responsiveness to changes in the environment meant I could rarely sit still or rely on just one weapon. I loved that incentive to not only shake up my strategy but also become more familiar with any given area as quickly as possible. I sometimes found myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. \u201c And yes, despite all of the added nuance, Part 2 has some of the most bluntly brutal combat animations I\u2019ve seen in any game, and it\u2019s never played to a cartoonish degree the way something like Mortal Kombat does. It fits thematically with the tone, Ellie\u2019s revenge-minded focus, and the violence those in power will use to control this post-pandemic society, but that doesn\u2019t make the impact any less gruesome, and occasionally hard to stomach. The most frequent kill I witnessed was Ellie\u2019s stealth takedown: a grab, stab, and slow, clumsy fall to the ground for every enemy I used it on. Shotguns are powerful and scary \u2014 just as Ellie can be knocked down, so too can an enemy. Choosing to fight \u2013 to graphically cut into an enemy\u2019s throat or blast them against the wall with a shotgun \u2013 is tough to stomach in Part 2, intentionally so. And while it certainly reflects the reality of Ellie\u2019s world, and its enemies reflect that character behavior back at you in powerful ways, I did sometimes find myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. Avoiding combat entirely is often possible, but it\u2019s rarely easy given how mobile and perceptive enemies are. I often had to sacrifice at least two or three enemies per encounter \u2013 especially when enemy dogs who can track Ellie\u2019s scent are thrown into the mix.   As a Dog Lover In The Last of Us Part 2, dogs are a major threat because they can sniff you out even when Ellie\u2019s well-hidden from humans. You can distract them with throwable bottles or bricks, but if you don\u2019t keep moving they\u2019ll inevitably pick your scent back up. As a dog owner , I found it horrifying to be confronted with a situation in which I have to kill a dog (as opposed to a human who\u2019s made a conscious decision to fight you to the death). No, they\u2019re not real, but Naughty Dog has done an amazing job of animating their namesakes in lifelike ways. While you can\u2019t feed treats to or play fetch with the dogs in the middle of battle, if it\u2019s just too much to have to subdue one, I suggest sprinting away for your life. Dogs can pick up your scent, if you\u2019re far enough away they become disinterested in you until they eventually amble closer to you on the map. Heights are your friend as well because, unlike Air Bud, there\u2019s something in the Last of Us rulebook about dogs not being allowed to climb ladders. I often used those techniques to avoid watching Ellie do something I never could.  Part 2\u2019s expansive environments aren\u2019t just there to be sandboxes of death, though. The artfully detailed and realized locations tell layers of story, from the macro-destruction of a certain city district down to the posters and calendars hung on abandoned apartment walls. Some of the original Last of Us\u2019 most interesting bits of backstory were found in scattered notes and diary pages, and the jump in detail for Part 2 astounded me. It seems as though every room has a story to tell, every office has a history, every store shows a place or group of people frozen in time. I spent more time than I\u2019d care to admit studying abandoned D&D games in apartments, listening to ancillary conversations, and trying to read deteriorating book covers. Whether I found equipment and crafting materials or not, the thoughtful intent in each one of these objects and interactions made exploring feel valuable regardless. I never once had to grab a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn\u2019t swim. \u201c Even better is that I never once had to navigate these areas by grabbing a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn\u2019t swim, like the original so often asked us to do. Part 2\u2019s environmental puzzles never feel as mindless as that \u2013 they have a lot more contextual challenges that make smart use of Ellie\u2019s journey through skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods, sewers, plains, and more. From figuring out how to angle a rope to swing from one office to another locked room to navigating a perilous series of tripwires using Ellie\u2019s new mobility to many more everyday tasks that take on new tension in a post-apocalypse setting, Part 2 makes much better use of its environment to offer unique, consistently engaging puzzles and platforming routes. And those clever designs are dressed with some of the most beautiful environments I\u2019ve seen from the PlayStation 4/PlayStation 4 Pro generation. Every IGN PlayStation First-Party Exclusive Review 239 Images And while Part 2 is not an open-world game, it does include an open-world area that learns lessons from Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy\u2019s attempts at the same design idea, this time to much better effect. While those games presented areas of open, explorable wildernesses, they often didn\u2019t have much to find there, making exploration feel somewhat aimless. In Part 2, though, a dilapidated district of Seattle offers years of lost history, a mixture of events frozen in time by the pandemic and those who have tried to survive here since. Its scope and scale won\u2019t challenge Rockstar\u2019s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way and is thoughtfully used by Naughty Dog to not only explain Part 2\u2019s setting at large, but also allow for a number of welcome, discoverable character moments. Its scope and scale won\u2019t challenge Rockstar\u2019s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way. \u201c But even outside of that area, Jackson, other parts of Seattle, and more are gorgeous and memorable locations. The Wyoming countryside is lovely, too, whether it be mountains covered in bright snow or fields of wheat shining in the evening sunset. And sure, the Pacific Northwest is as rainy as you would expect, but Naughty Dog has taken the gloom of grey clouds and grey buildings and crafted something ominous, beautiful, and haunting. Lush vegetation grows over dilapidated storefronts and homes in the suburbs while the smashed, looming skyscrapers of the city form new, mesmerizing stone monuments. Seven years and a new generation has allowed Naughty Dog to create locations that, while very much like the ruined vestiges of civilization in the original, are so much more richly detailed, with more distinct and varied interiors, striking outdoor lighting, and inventive new locations that play to Seattle\u2019s seaside setting. Every Modern IGN 10/10 and Where to Play Them 29 Images Evocative audio design, backed by the moving score of returning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, plays a big role as well. It all comes down to the little details: characteristically for the region, the oppressive thump of rain masks the terrifying noises of the infected that lurk outside; the slam of debris that blocks a doorway and the quiet creaking of an alternative exit; the slight hum of a silenced pistol versus the harrowing boom of a shotgun; and vocal performances from the guttural screams of the Clickers to the muttered self-reflection from Ellie as she kills an enemy.   Impressive Accessibility Naughty Dog has introduced dozens of new accessibility options for The Last of Us Part 2, which go far beyond just full control customization and text font size changes. A variety of visual, audio, motion sickness, and control settings can be tweaked (check out the full options here ), and some can even be turned off and on once activated with simple and smartly integrated swipes of the DualShock 4\u2019s touchpad. As someone who does not necessarily need these options to play I can\u2019t speak to their efficacy, but they\u2019re impressively extensive on paper and their ease of use and customizability is certainly on a level I haven\u2019t seen from Sony before. I hope this is a sign of things to come as we move into the PlayStation 5 generation. "

        "Content": "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar\u2019s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it\u2019s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn\u2019t just Rockstar\u2019s greatest achievement to date; it\u2019s a game so lacking in compromise it\u2019s tough to know where best to start discussing it. So let\u2019s start at the beginning: It\u2019s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they\u2019ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story. Every Modern IGN 10/10 and Where to Play Them 29 Images It\u2019s a self-contained and linear introduction but it\u2019s a clever one. The slick cinematics make a hell of first impression, embedding you in the gang and bringing you right up close to the characters who are doing their best to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s early controls and systems, which heightened the impact of having the full map open up to me a few hours later. The conditions on the mountain are almost claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow trapping Arthur\u2019s feet. Being set loose in the true open world after toughing it out in this intentionally oppressive environment really underscores the incredible feeling of freedom the full map offers. label=The%20Big%20Country And what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the one we explored in 2010\u2019s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game\u2019s map are also included). Ideally viewed on one of the best ultrawide monitors , there are snowy peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There\u2019s the muddy livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then there\u2019s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable. Red Dead Redemption 2 does an exceptional job at slowly rationing out reasons to visit every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to areas of the map I hadn\u2019t yet visited even in the closing stages of its 60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards are kept up its sleeve, the joy of discovering new parts of the world is maintained throughout. The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinaryThe ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it\u2019s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it\u2019s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not. I\u2019ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate \u201cGav.\u201d None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur\u2019s story; it just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that few \u2013 if any \u2013 games have before. label=In%20a%20Valley%20of%20Violence The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing. Guns Arthur isn\u2019t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it. I suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as chore-like, but I really dig it. There\u2019s something methodical about it that really helps ground Arthur in the world, rather than have him feel like he\u2019s gliding through it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical process of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action rifle via a second pull of the fire button \u2013 you can even pause for dramatic effect halfway through. Rockstar\u2019s designers didn\u2019t need to factor that in but I think they understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle control like this subconsciously seat me into the world as Arthur even more. The unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for goodies is an interesting design decision but I quite like the risk versus reward loot loop, to be honest. Do I dart around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or do I just get the hell out of Dodge? They\u2019re consequences you have to be prepared to accept either because your attention is needed elsewhere or because lingering around the scene of a crime naturally puts you at further risk of being discovered. Bounties don\u2019t always come cheap. Did one of those fellas have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you\u2019ll never know. About my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I was previously carrying are regularly swapped out for others. Oftentimes it\u2019s clearly mission-related to ensure you go into a task with a scoped rifle or bow when required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I end up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the game trading out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of time it takes to swap back did elicit the occasional grumble from me. I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museumAt any rate, it\u2019s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there\u2019s just so much to see and hear. You\u2019ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I\u2019ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can\u2019t understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me. Elsewhere in the world there\u2019s still plenty for those who care to stop and smell the roses. Newspapers sold on street corners touch on the aftermath of Arthur\u2019s exploits, as well as other things going on around the world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take in some old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum. There\u2019s simply too much to list. label=How%20the%20West%20Was%20Won The main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists, deadly shootouts, desperate rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as organic ways to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be undertaken, from selling stolen horses to playing poker or fishing. It all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate predecessor but injected with a pile of new animations and multiple layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of buttons on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require a tap and which require a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and the same style of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised Rockstar games since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people\u2019s hats and pick them up later for yourself. I think there\u2019s a common presumption that Red Dead Redemption is just GTA on a horse, but that\u2019s a bit reductive. Certainly the GTA DNA is here, but with far more primitive firearms at your fingertips gun battles are more intimate and anarchic. I love the close range clashes, hunkered down behind bits of cover exchanging lead with enemies often just yards away, or slugging it out in bareknuckle scraps. It\u2019s exciting and fun. Combat from horseback is equally well-handled and it\u2019s always a grisly highlight to watch unfortunate saps go limp and tumble from the saddle in a seemingly endless number of ways. I think Arthur feels a fraction heavier than any of the GTA V trio, but I would not say that I found his movement cumbersome. I really like how connected Arthur feels to the world. I\u2019m not a particular fan of that old-school, skating third-person feel \u2013 like the player character has no inertia \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly not present here. Dead Eye returns, naturally, as it\u2019s been part of the series since Red Dead Revolver. It\u2019s had some upgrades this time, the most useful of which highlights critical hit areas on a target (very useful for clean kills while hunting). It\u2019s still a very effective way to make you feel like an unstoppable gunslinger and the gruesome ballet of slow-motion death-dealing remains disturbingly satisfying. I didn\u2019t engage much with the available camp upgrade options \u2013 not the aesthetic ones, at least. There are some practical upgrades I acquired that had gameplay benefits attached, like a boat to go fishing in or a map at Arthur\u2019s quarters that unlocks fast travel. I don\u2019t feel like I missed much by opting out of purchasing animal skulls and rugs and such. This stuff feels a little more like a primer for Red Dead Online, the multiplayer component coming at an unspecified later date. I chose not to do a huge amount of crafting, either, and I was never really punished for it. You can craft tonics and satchels, and recipes can be discovered throughout the course of the story. However, I mostly made it through on purchased items, restocking in camp, and religiously ransacking dead bodies for liquor, health tonics, and cigarettes. (I created a lot of dead bodies.) Two new elements I did take quite seriously were horse bonding and the honour system. The former is an inspired method of making you treat your horse with realistic respect instead of riding the poor thing off cliffs or parking it on train tracks for giggles. All horses are unique, and only the ones that trust Arthur can be relied upon to stay calm and not kick him off in the face of a predator or in a gun battle, and that trust is built by riding, brushing, and feeding it. I liked having to click in the thumbstick to reassure my horse when he was scared \u2013 it makes him feel real and establishes a physical-to-digital bond between you two. Your horse can die, too, and there\u2019s no bringing him or her back if that happens. I kept the same horse from early in the game all the way to the finale and was truly attached to that big guy. Some of the other folk here have been less lucky and have had to endure the gut punch of euthanising their equine comrade (always pack some horse revivers, people). Meanwhile, Arthur\u2019s personal honour is something that\u2019s in the background at all times, rising and falling based on his actions in the world. In practical terms, being an outlaw who refrains from killing in cold blood and who helps regular folk around the world gets you discounts in shops and generally means you won\u2019t have to look over your shoulder quite as often for bounty hunters and lawmen. Playing through as a vicious monster is also possible, although it\u2019s not entirely clear to me whether there\u2019d be some dissonance between that approach and Arthur\u2019s actual story. I still need to investigate further, but I\u2019m really happy with how my playthrough turned out and the outlaw-with-a-soft-side Arthur I chose to inhabit. label=Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%20In%20the%20West Red Dead Redemption 2 is an undeniably pretty game across the board. The lighting is fantastic, particularly in dark, misty situations where shafts of moonlight stab through the trees, and I love the way it handles Arthur leaving weakly-lit interiors into the temporarily blinding sun outside. The sunsets are especially spectacular and seem to vary depending on the weather system. Some are harsh and beaming while others are warm and soft. The facial animation is a noticeable step up from GTA V, and the level of granular detail is almost absurd, from the way blood smears on Arthur\u2019s shoulder after carrying a kill to the way individual strands of his majestic mutton chops quiver in the breeze. The way wagon wheels become caked in mud. The way rust builds up on a poorly-maintained firearm. It\u2019s another long, long list that speaks to a high level of attention to detail. No matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcrafted. Every consumable is labelled and can be picked up and inspected. Every catalogue in stores is full of custom text and illustrations pointing to products available for sale or old timey advertisements. Hallways are decorated with framed pictures I\u2019ve never noticed repeated throughout the world. Remember: this is the game where horse testicles shrink when the weather is cold. More than once I found myself temporarily hypnotised by the musculature and skin creases on my horse\u2019s butt. That\u2019s a weird sentence, but you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time looking at a horse\u2019s butt. It might as well impress you. No matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcraftedHorses are astonishingly well-animated and feel like genuine living creatures as they swing their necks, stomp their feet, and shudder their bodies on their own accord. That said, it\u2019d be nice if the same self-preservation skills horses display when galloping towards a ravine kicked in when careening towards an obstacle in front \u2013 I definitely clattered into a few posts and fellow riders before figuring out my steed generally wasn\u2019t going to avoid those on his own. label=Johnny%20Guitar Equally impressive is the audio, from the sound effects to the voice work to the huge library of music. Whether you\u2019re expecting the satisfying metallic crunch of a reload, the iconic twang of a Hollywood Western ricochet, or the subtle squeak of a hotel floorboard, it\u2019s all there. Bullets fired on mountaintops ring with cracking echoes, completely different to the sound of bullets fired indoors. There are a wide range of unique sounds that have been recorded to appear just once or twice across the whole of Red Dead Redemption 2, like the squeak of detonator wire being unspooled or the clink of bottles in the back of a moonshine wagon. They\u2019re all constant reminders that little seems to have been missed. I also love how the world seems to be prepared for pretty much any action you can think ofI also love how the world seems to be prepared for pretty much any action you can think of. Turn around and walk straight back into a store you\u2019ve just left and the shopkeeper will likely make a comment about how you\u2019re back so soon. Leave a theatre before a film is finished and the ticket clerk will quip, \u201cSeems you didn\u2019t like that.\u201d Shoot a polite howdy towards two people standing together and Arthur will use a plural term rather than a singular pronoun. It all contributes to a feeling of rare polish that\u2019s even rarer in a game of this girth. And the music? It\u2019s outstanding. Woody Jackson\u2019s original score is top notch \u2013 an evocative mix of jangling Ennio Morricone-esque guitar and more soulful pieces better suited to patiently trotting through the world absorbing its mixture of beauty and ugliness. There are also a few occasions where non-instrumental tracks are used to excellent effect; one artist, in particular, was a big surprise to me and sings an impactful track during a key moment late in the story. label=The%20Wild%20Bunch The plot thread holding Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s astonishing array of systems and gameplay opportunities together is Rockstar\u2019s most serious and earnest story to date, and certainly the best written. It\u2019s not essential to have played Red Dead Redemption to appreciate and understand what\u2019s going on here, especially since this is a prequel story that takes place 12 years earlier, although I found it very rewarding being familiar with the larger plot as it connects to the eventual fate of the enigmatic Dutch van der Linde. Arthur\u2019s relationship with Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston here is also particularly fascinating to me as a fan of the 2010 game, and it\u2019s very well-handled. Marston is a crucial part of the story but Rockstar has been restrained enough to not spotlight him at Arthur\u2019s expense. We get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch\u2019s confidence ebbs and his restraint fadesEven better, however, is watching Dutch\u2019s gradual descent from being the charismatic, successful, and clever leader of a gang of deadly outlaws to someone on track to become the cold-blooded and beaten man being hunted down by Marston 12 years later. We get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch\u2019s confidence ebbs and his restraint fades. Excellent, too, is main man Arthur: Not only is there an infectious authenticity to his low and smooth tone of voice, which seems perfect beneath the swept-back hair and enormous mutton chops I let him sprout by only ever shaving his chin, but when Arthur himself is a far wearier man by the story\u2019s climax his delivery is doubly potent. Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever 184 Images The whole cast is great, really. Antagonists like the Pinkertons on the gang\u2019s trail are a little thinly painted and something about young Jack Marston\u2019s sing-song voice didn\u2019t sit right with me, but Arthur\u2019s partners in crime all get swags of screen time; certainly enough to feel like convincing, three-dimensional characters that Arthur has a real relationship with. What\u2019s more is that despite representing a wide range of folk from a variety of disparate cultures \u2013 from Irish thug Sean Macguire to Native American brawler Charles Smith \u2013 they all feel like credible human beings and not caricatures. Combined with strong writing and direction, the result is a game that\u2019s sincere instead of satirical, and funny while remaining capable of some supremely well-earned emotional moments, especially throughout the truly excellent crescendo and epilogue. And even after completing the epilogue, which is split into two parts and longer than many whole games I\u2019ve played in recent memory, I still have a stack of strangers that need helping, gangs that need killing, cheats to experiment with , and fish that need catching.

        "Content": "Update: The Witness has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .  The Witness is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries that sunk into my subconscious, tracing snaking paths across my brain until I was literally seeing mazes every time I closed my eyes. That\u2019s the kind of power The Witness has. It hooked me in with its masterful puzzle design and gorgeous visuals, then compelled me forward as I began to carve out my own purpose on the island. It\u2019s a freedom granted by a world as welcomingly open to exploration as it is enjoyably challenging to solve.   The Witness is a fully 3D world navigated in first person, but revolves around solving two-dimensional mazes found on in-game panels, completed by drawing the correct path from a circular start point to a rounded end point. This simple, intuitive core concept burns at the center of the 700 or so puzzles you\u2019ll find on The Witness\u2019s enigmatic island setting. Tracing lines feels as smooth as cutting butter with both a mouse and a gamepad and is accompanied by a warm, electric buzzing effect. The pure tactile joy of communicating with these interfaces and the initial sense of wonder and mystery their very presence brings were enough to motivate me in the earliest moments of The Witness. But these light-up labyrinths quickly became more sophisticated, adding new rules and constraints to the basic maze-like structure and thus allowing for the real tough, yet fulfilling challenges to emerge.  Puzzles With a Purpose  Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but fair. \u201c As I learned to apply each new rule, curiosity soon gave way to obsessive levels of motivation and purpose. I wasn\u2019t just solving puzzles because they were fun \u2013 slowly but surely, they were beginning to make sense in a much larger context. This manifests most tangibly in The Witness\u2019s first obvious, overarching \u201cgoal\u201d \u2013 shooting beams of light into a mountain. The mountain serves as the island\u2019s highest point, most prominent landmark, and consequently its most central mystery for reasons that are obvious once you start playing, but which I won\u2019t spoil here.  Most of the major regions on the island house machinery capable of shooting light into the mountain, but can only be activated once you solve the right sequence of puzzles, bestowing my frantic line-drawing antics with an important sense of progress. It also helped me see the various regions of the island as distinct parts of a larger, cohesive whole, making the constant treks across the surprisingly large, dense land mass less daunting because of it. It let me set my own goals, trace my own path around the island, so I never had to feel lost, physically or in terms of my role on the island. A map of the island.  There was also enough to do and see beyond the key objectives that my time spent simply wandering still felt compelling minute to minute. I could take a peaceful boat ride around the perimeter, explore the ruins of a wrecked ship, finally make the descent into that hidden underground passage I\u2019d discovered on a previous errand. I valued these quiet moments on the island as much as I did overcoming its most perplexing puzzles, especially during the times I felt truly stuck.  A New Perspective  Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but they\u2019re always fair and solvable. In a manner more freeing than most puzzle adventures, you\u2019re allowed and even encouraged to walk away from a problem you don\u2019t feel equipped to solve. That\u2019s a concept introduced in the opening minutes, when you encounter a locked door covered in symbols you\u2019re unfamiliar with. The answers you need are further up the path, but you have to let yourself walk away first to know that. The Witness does more than equip you with the tools needed to find the right answers \u2013 it teaches you how to ask the right questions.   Expand this dynamic to the whole of the island, and you get an intelligently designed puzzle game that doesn\u2019t just give you the freedom to chip away at its riddles at your own pace, but creates a compelling adventure of the learning process itself.  I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it. \u201c The masterful design of The Witness\u2019s puzzles is matched by the beautiful and clever layout of the island itself. One early sequence of puzzles unlocks a small courtyard full of sketches and diagrams of human hearts and veins. It didn\u2019t seem of immediate significance when I found it, until I walked out to the neighboring cliffside I had passed by on my way there and noticed the way the red tree roots growing along the edges of the seaside bluff looked like bright, thick arteries coursing through the flesh of the earth. These startling and sometimes enlightening visual revelations were everywhere, adding excitement and meaning to the world even when I wasn\u2019t actively seeking it out. Sights become symbolic with the right context.  Every tree, every rock, feels like it has been placed with a purpose, allowing familiar sights to take on thematic weight when viewed from different angles. Ordinary landmarks became focal points when framed with precise deliberation between a grove of trees, or perfectly centered inside a hollow window frame. That\u2019s kind of what The Witness is about: pointing you toward new ways of seeing.  Many times, finding the answer meant stepping away from the actual puzzle and asking myself what I wasn\u2019t seeing. Puzzles in The Witness are solved on these panels, but it doesn't mean everything you need to solve them exists within their physical confines. No matter what question a particular puzzle posed, I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it.   Island of Enlightenment  A lot of games try to be about things, but The Witness actually embodies those things. Audio logs hidden around the island contain quotes from famous philosophers and scientists, chosen with obvious care for the way each speaks to specific concepts The Witness sets out to explore. The graceful design of the island had already managed to provoke natural epiphanies about ideas some of the quotes address, so at times the logs felt unnecessary. But then other times the words spoke to me, in the same way the physical island had: an invitation to see things from a new point of view that maybe I hadn\u2019t considered. The view from the top.  Some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight... \u201c One particular quote at the top of the mountain comes from former astronaut Russell Schweickart. As I looked down at the island from its highest point, I felt a connection between what Schweickart was describing , when he spoke about the transformative effect of looking down at the Earth from space, and the all-encompassing view of the island the mountain afforded me. Like the Earth that Schweickart describes, spinning around the same way every day, revealing the same places with each rotation, nothing about the island ever really changes. I could walk by the same thing in The Witness ninety-nine times and never have a second thought, but then on the 100th passing, I'd notice something new about it. But not because the thing itself had changed \u2013 because I had.  Like everything else in The Witness, finding more concrete answers about this abandoned island and the people who once occupied it requires patience. There\u2019s plenty there to dissect \u2013 statues that seem like people frozen from various eras, mysterious corporate logos, hidden audio logs \u2013 and it was all enough to keep me enthralled in the mysteries it built across my 40- to 50-hour playthrough. Most of the time it\u2019s more questions than answers, and I enjoyed that it left things open to interpretation. Statues around the island seem like people from all eras, frozen in time.  There\u2019s also a lot you can miss \u2013 secrets tucked away behind the island\u2019s most challenging obstacles \u2013 but some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight, making every return to the island a new adventure. I estimate it would take 80 to 100 hours to fully do and see everything here, but there\u2019s a satisfying amount of thematic weight and contextual clues that I was able to reach the ending the first time without feeling like The Witness owed me a greater answer to its riddles. Story doesn\u2019t drive The Witness as much as its mystery, nor does it treat story as an arbitrary reward for your efforts; what\u2019s there only enriches an already fulfilling experience."

        "Content": "When we first reviewed Grand Theft Auto 5 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in September of 2013, we declared it a masterpiece and awarded a score of 10 out of 10. Here\u2019s what we said then:   Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It\u2019s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it\u2019s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.  It is one of the very best video games ever made.   That\u2019s still where we stand on it today. And whether you agree that it\u2019s a masterpiece or not, the PC version is definitely the best way to play GTA 5. Developer Rockstar has taken full advantage of the technical power of the platform, and made GTA feel right at home here. It\u2019s well optimized, and the frame rate and resolution will go as high as your hardware can handle \u2013 including 4K/UHD resolutions and multi-display setups. Maxed out, the enormous and incredibly detailed open-world region of San Andreas looks more amazing than ever, thanks to long draw distances and enhanced effects. This is the only place you can play GTA 5 at 60 frames per second (or higher), and with all the high-speed driving and shooting, it definitely benefits from that smoothness.  Graphics options are plentiful and powerful, with everything from standard quality and view-distance adjustments to a field-of-view slider (though it\u2019s more limited than discriminating FOV players might want - modders have already remedied that). Controls are customizable, and you can play your own music library on the in-game radio. It\u2019s hard to complain much about that.  For the most part, the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. That\u2019s best exemplified with the web browser, which feels like you\u2019d expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus; it\u2019s a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation gun store\u2019s wares with the mouse than it is with a D-pad or arrow keys, but it\u2019s still totally workable. It\u2019s simply a small reminder that this wasn\u2019t originally a PC game.  Using a mouse to shoot, on the other hand, is good enough that it risks making combat feel a little too easy. I don\u2019t pretend to be a brilliant marksman, but if you\u2019re a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos , your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when I\u2019m using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto-aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass, I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head, especially when playing in first-person mode. That doesn\u2019t mean I felt invincible, though; because the authorities will never stop coming until you give up and run away or die, they\u2019re always going to give you a challenging fight through the weight of sheer numbers.  Nice PC-specific control touches, like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You don\u2019t get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first-person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions, either.  One of my favorite things about the control setup, though, is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it, GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap - just push a button on one or the other, and all on-screen prompts change to reflect what you\u2019re using. It\u2019s a fantastic thing for a game like this, where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick.

Though I\u2019ve experienced the occasional disconnect or bout of lag, it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary for an online game that matches up groups of up to 30 players. What is out of the ordinary is how diverse and varied the available activities are: dozens of different types of deathmatches, co-op missions (including the all-new and very impressive multi-stage heists), races over land, sea, and air (some of which involving combat), and general open-world chaos like spontaneous drive-by shootings (or strafing runs) of other players. The online version of San Andreas is a place where anything can happen at any time, and it\u2019s fantastic to watch people make use of that freedom, even if the majority of it is the inherent humor of crashing things into other things.   The main PC-specific feature is the Rockstar Editor movie tool and its associated Director Mode , which gives you access to a wide spectrum of playable character models. It\u2019s a powerful creative tool that lets you easily capture gameplay clips and then edit and export them into what can end up as extremely elaborate movies. I did experience a crash that robbed me of about an hour\u2019s work on a classy short film about a man in an alien costume who punches people on a beach without provocation. I love the flexibility of the camera and the simplicity of the editing controls \u2013 they make me wish I had a finer eye for filmmaking as I go for easy laughs with a montage of slow-motion close ups of fists hitting faces. Fortunately, there are far more creatively talented folks out there who will entertain us for years to come with GTA 5-made machinima."

        "Content": "   What+is+it?   Infinity Blade II is the perfect video game sequel. The visceral and cinematic melee combat has been expanded from a glorified quicktime event into a proper, fleshed-out fighting system. IB1's thin storyline has been replaced with a voice-acted narrative full of twists and turns. And players now have an entire castle to explore, full of branching paths and secrets, in place of the original's short and linear path to the God-King. Chair successfully accomplished all this while also setting a new standard for mobile game visuals.  Infinity Blade II picks up right where the original left off. Our hero (retroactively named Siris) needs help from The Worker of Secrets - the titular blade's creator. The catch? The Worker has been imprisoned and can only be released if three \"Deathless\" are defeated. Each resides in the Vault of Tears, at the end of a lengthy gauntlet of enemies. Along the way players learn much more about Siris' true nature, and why he is seemingly doomed to repeat a never-ending cycle of violence.  Cue dozens upon dozens of enemy encounters, as Siris explores the Vault's varied branching paths. After every battle gamers earn a helping of XP and Gold, allowing players to increase Siris' stats and purchase new weapons and equipment.     Did+we+like+it?  Infinity Blade's touch-powered sword-slashing combat has always been a blast, but the sequel infuses it with much more depth. Each and every enemy encounter felt fresh and fun for the duration of the 5-6 hours it took me to reach & defeat the final boss.  I especially appreciated the two new combat styles at my disposal. Players can still use the IB1-standard sword and shield, but it's tough to go back after experiencing the sequel's devastating heavy weapon and explosive dual wielding systems. Heavy weapons allow for powerful critical hits by swiping in specific directions, and dual wielding enables massive combos while dropping the ability to block. Any time I got tired of one combat system, I simply bought a new weapon and switched.  Little (and not-so-little) tweaks are abound in Infinity Blade 2, making every aspect of the game more enjoyable than its already-polished predecessor. Enemy patterns seem more dynamic. Far more bags of gold litter the environment. Enemies can now cast magic. Players can slot gems into weapons and armor for special bonuses. The entire menu UI has been re-worked, sorted by equipment slot. It's clear a lot of care and attention went into virtually every aspect of this sequel.  The branching paths that make up The Vault of Tears represent the next evolution of the \"looping\" game structure pioneered in the original Infinity Blade. Players still have to travel through the Vault several times to complete the game, but I was still finding new rooms and connections between areas of the castle several hours in, reducing the grindy feeling of these loops. Chair is seemingly one step ahead of other mobile game makers \u2013 just as other studios are beginning to ape the original's repetitive loops, Infinity Blade 2 reinvents its own formula.  Of course, it certainly helps that Infinity Blade 2 is absolutely gorgeous. The game is incredibly impressive on a technical level, with realtime shadows, improved particle effects, and other abstruse bells & whistles. But more importantly, the game represents a maturation in Chair's ability to create memorable set pieces and enemies. The game's entire aesthetic is a clear cut above what anyone else is even attempting on iOS.     Should+you+buy+it?  Infinity Blade 2 is a perfect representation of what iOS games are capable of. Chair has created a near-flawless combination of best-of-breed visuals and touch-controlled gameplay.  Best of all, the entire package is a bigger and better value than the original in virtually every way. Four times the number of combat locations. Nearly triple the volume of equipment. Double the number of unique enemy types. And once you complete it all, a robust and challenging New Game+ awaits. Chair is also promising aggressive post-launch support, including cooperative multiplayer \"Clash Mobs.\"  Infinity Blade 2 is a must own - it is the App Store's killer app."

        "Content": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the greatest Zelda game ever created. It's the best game for Wii and one of the finest video game accomplishments of the past 10 years. The game has once again raised the bar and forged new territory for an iconic and innovative franchise. It's not enough that it finally establishes a powerful, stirring origin story or that it features near-perfect pacing. What puts Skyward Sword over the top is its layered, dense, absolutely perfect gameplay that manages to not only nail motion-controlled combat but remarkably offers a stunning level of diversity. Every story has a beginning, and The Legend of Zelda is no exception - we simply hadn't been privy to it until now. Nintendo is finally willing to take a look at Hyrule's distant past, focusing on a Link and Zelda who are childhood friends before, as you might expect, something goes horribly off track. Link then embarks on a quest with the fate of the world - and his friend - in the balance. Skyward Sword sets a new, important benchmark for Nintendo. Modern video games have made significant strides in how they present stories to audiences, and it seems as though Nintendo has finally taken notice. Skyward Sword features cinematics that play out like a movie. At times they are downright captivating with their picturesque settings and powerful drama. The game lacks voice acting as always, but characters' emotions shine through regardless, and the framing of scenes is incredible. As the story moves into its final act, you'll be stunned at the quality on display here. This is easily Nintendo's best storytelling to date. The tale is, at heart, fairly simple. An evil entity wants to destroy peace, love and happiness, and Link is going to make sure that doesn't happen. It's not so much the plot that's important but the people in it. Skyward Sword's characters are phenomenal. Link is his usual mute self, more of an avatar for the player than anything else, but everyone surrounding him is remarkably memorable and charming. Zelda herself is by far the star of the show and her relationship with Link early on forms the backbone of the entire game. You want Link to succeed not so much because you're worried about saving what will eventually become Hyrule, but because you genuinely care that he cares about Zelda.  You have a long journey ahead, Link.  The same could be said for most of the supporting cast. Fi, a spirit that functions as Link's advisor and guide, is a spectacular creation, probably best likened to a benevolent GLaDOS. Though primarily designed to give players direction and tips, Fi is actually a great source of humor as she fails to understand human emotion and reports brutally honest statistical percentages on your likelihood of success. Smaller roles, such as the couple dozen inhabitants of Skyloft, are so distinct and colorful you'll likely remember them despite their insignificance to the larger plot. Between day and night cycles as well as the ever-shifting narrative, there are plenty of side quests for Link to pursue - and that's to say nothing about the wider world, above and below the clouds. Pairing itself with Wii MotionPlus, Skyward Sword's 1:1 combat is a revelation. I never want to play a Zelda game any other way again, and playing through this makes me wonder why we didn't see motion control of this quality before. The responsiveness and intuitiveness of the entire arrangement is superb. The applications of Motion Plus never step into gimmicky territory. Guiding your mechanical flying Beetle, rolling bombs, swimming in water and soaring through the sky by pivoting and flicking the remote not only feels natural, it makes you wonder how you ever played an action game that wasn't on Wii. Zelda: Skyward Sword is the purest, most perfect realization of Nintendo's ambitious goals for motion-controlled gaming. It somehow took five years, but the definitive proof plays out before you on the screen. The new combat system requires skill and patience. Though impulsive, unpredictable waggling can get some results, most enemies are programmed to react to such behavior, and they'll punish you for it. On occasion my temper would get the best of me against an enemy, but swinging my remote faster didn't help. Some enemies anticipate your moves or use their weapons to block certain attacks, making routine fights far more challenging and complicated than in past Zelda games. None of your enemies are overtly difficult, but the added complexity, combined with more sophisticated puzzles and world designs, make each victory that much sweeter. What Ocarina of Time started with lock-on targeting, Skyward Sword perfects by adding layers of nuanced strategy. You'll rarely die, but you'll find yourself working hard to defeat and out-maneuver your opponents. Combat isn't the only area of the game that's become more thought-provoking. Nintendo has changed the concept of dungeons and the overworld itself. Previously, a wide open mainland would branch off to smaller areas that would lead to vast dungeons. That concept effectively ends in Skyward Sword. Though the sky realm is a huge area to navigate, it's generally just used as a way to access different regions in the land below. The game wisely implements a quick travel system early on, allowing Link to rapidly access areas he has already explored and removing a potentially tedious element. There is a slight disconnect between the earthly realms, but that does serve to add a sense of wonder about the unknown, particularly when huge areas of your map remain blank.  Fi is a masterful companion and a brilliant addition to the Zelda franchise.  The changes don't end there. Not only is travel faster, but the surface world packs in an enormous amount of content. Taking a page from Metroid, Skyward Sword requires you to travel repeatedly back to familiar environments, each time altering some key attribute or providing you with new tools to make the experience completely fresh. New areas and paths lead to vast, unexplored territory that is just as deep, important and engrossing as any of the material that preceded it. Combat aside, Nintendo's greatest achievement in Skyward Sword just might be its new approach to designing its worlds. Arriving at dungeons and temples now takes hours, and none of that time is wasted. The sheer brilliance on display here, evident more and more as you journey deeper into the game, will stun even the most jaded gamer. Dungeons are now smaller, and tired staples like lighting torches and endlessly pushing blocks are largely absent in favor of far more creative concepts that frequently use all of the items at Link's disposal. Some dungeons even relish forcing you to methodically work one item to the next, a reminder that you have many tools at your disposal. Skyward Sword's dungeons not only manage to progressively get better, they're some of the most genius designs ever seen in the Zelda series. The final temple just might be the best Nintendo has ever created. Despite their polarizing, standard definition nature, Skyward Sword's visuals count amongst its strongest points. Nintendo has finally found a style that perfectly embodies the Zelda series. By capturing the maturity of Twilight Princess and the vibrant, youthful energy of Wind Waker, this franchise now has the perfect outlet to fully express itself without compromise. Full of bizarre, quirky characters as well as creatures from the darkness, Nintendo has found a tone that captures the best of both ideas while still serving the most important element of all - the gameplay. Great graphics don't always revolve around polygon counts and high-res textures. Where Skyward manages to excel, and completely overcome its hardware limitations, is its creative and inventive art direction. The minimalist approach not only serves the game's tone but allows the designers to come up with outlandish environments and creatures that wouldn't work in a more realistic setting. Animation and character expressions are equally well done, and are largely responsible for why the game's cinematics work so effectively. Nintendo also implemented a clever, distance-based filter that blurs objects and scenery further in the background. Though initially jarring, it actually has a rather painterly quality to it that hides its attempt to help Wii cope with the game's epic scale. Music has always been an important element of the Zelda series, increasingly so when Ocarina of Time tied gameplay and sound together over a decade ago. Skyward Sword represents a shift in that dynamic, confining the involvement of music and instruments largely to optional tasks or the plot itself. Don't expect acquiring the harp to significantly change how you'll play the game. Songs are generally discovered and played once as Link continues his adventure. Beyond that, expect to only play strings when Link needs a bit of extra health or wants a hint from a Gossip Stone. The standard for music in the Zelda series is very high. While this legacy makes it difficult to rank this score above other titles, some of the themes in Skyward Sword stand alongside Zelda's best, utilizing orchestral music for the first time in the franchise's history. Nintendo was very selective in its usage of the orchestra, opting only for sequences that were very grand in scope. The music that plays as Link flies through the sky is a great example of this. No game is perfect, and Skyward Sword suffers from a few small issues. Every now and then the camera isn't quite in the position it ought to be. The Wii Remote will require calibration here and there, and somehow seems to know when doing so will be most inconvenient. The framerate will dip now and then, and of course the game is constrained by Wii's processing power as well. By and large the biggest amount of grief will come from whether or not the game is meeting some fans' expectations. Key ideas or iconic franchise concepts - you won't see the Iron Knuckle or the infamous Cuccoos here - were thrown out entirely in the name of evolution. All of these are fair observations, but ultimately they pale when compared to Skyward Sword's strengths. In many ways this game represents a breath of fresh air, the next major step for a superb franchise. It's hard to even care about small problems when you're watching Nintendo lay out its vision for the future of its grandest saga."

        "Content": "It feels like we've come to the end of an era. It's been over four and a half years since the Wii's Virtual Console first went live. In that time, we've seen the re-release of nearly four hundred different retro titles \u2013 some masterpieces, some duds and lots of in-between, average \"classics\" of yesteryear drawn from the back catalogs of the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and several other old-school consoles.  It's been an interesting journey, with some of us reliving bits and pieces of our childhoods and others discovering these titles for the very first time. And now, with Chrono Trigger , it feels like the journey's come to an end.  Chrono Trigger is one of the best video games ever made. A universally cherished role-playing game, it was originally released for the Super Nintendo in 1995. Its creation is the stuff of legend, as it was developed by a dream team of the most talented RPG makers of the 16-bit era, all coming together to work on this one epic project. And though it would be easy to write pages upon pages to explain its appeal, I'll attempt just three key points to sum up what makes it so timeless.  The first, appropriately enough, is time travel.    Crono is the name of our silent protagonist in Chrono Trigger. A wide-eyed, wild-haired boy living in the year 1000 A.D., he becomes thrust into a quest to save the world when a mysterious portal in time opens up and swallows his friend Marle. He boldly jumps in after her, setting in motion a story that has you following his adventures back in time to the past, forward in time to the distant future and every other point in-between \u2013 as what begins as a rescue mission for one young girl escalates into a battle for the fate of the planet.  The time-traveling concept set Chrono Trigger apart from other RPGs, as its many different eras of time are expertly interwoven and your actions in the past accurately influence the future. Other games of the SNES era began to explore the idea of alternate worlds or parallel dimensions, but here in Chrono Trigger you see the entire existence of a planet play out from the dawn of mankind all the way to beyond the apocalypse. That alone would have made Chrono Trigger a hit \u2013 but time travel was just the first of its many special qualities.  The battle system is second, as it was, and still is, wonderfully unique. You control a party of up to three heroes at a time, fighting foes right where you encounter them in the environment. There's no visual cut-away to some separate battlefield screen like in so many other RPGs \u2013 here, you see a baddie and you attack it right there.  What's more, the battle mechanics present an incredible variety of opportunities for teamwork. Every character has a basic Attack command, and can use Items too. Standard stuff. But the third option \u2013 \"Tech\" \u2013 is where it gets interesting. Selecting Tech lets you unleash more damaging assaults, magic spells and support maneuvers with individual heroes, but you can also combine more than one characters' moves together to create even more powerful combos.  Crono's a skilled swordsman who can leap and slash up enemies alone, for instance, while Marle's more magically gifted with the innate element of Water. Put the two of them together, though, and Marle can freeze Crono's sword mid-air so that his strike hits with the impact of an icy glacier \u2013 or Crono can spin his blade in circles while Marle casts a healing spell, to disperse the curative aura over every ally in the battle.  The interplay between the game's half-dozen or so different playable characters is wonderfully satisfying, as each one is developed with a distinctive personality and individual sidequests that reinforce who they are and really get you to like them. And the fact that there are more than three characters to choose from, while you can only use three at a time, helps fuel the game's third key point of appeal \u2013 replayability.    Chrono Trigger innovated the concept of a \"New Game +\" in which, after completing the story and seeing the credits roll, you could choose to restart the adventure with your powered-up, experience-pumped characters intact. It was a great idea, as it made things speedier on subsequent playthroughs as you attempted to achieve a different ending the second, third or ninth time through \u2013 because Chrono Trigger also innovated in offering tons of different ending sequences you could earn, depending on the choices you made while playing.  All of this time-jumping, three-hero tag-team battling and powered-up questing for more and more different story conclusions all came together to create one incredible masterpiece of a game, wrapped up with the most beautiful artwork and the greatest soundtrack any SNES title had ever seen. It should go without saying that Chrono Trigger is still worth your time and money today, and that it comes with my highest recommendation for 800 of your Wii Points.  Some naysayers will offer their opinions opposing such a purchase, pointing out that this same game has been recently re-released on the Nintendo DS in an edition that includes a couple of new dungeons and a retranslated script. I hold nothing against that version, or even the PlayStation 1 port that added anime-style cutscenes to the story 10 years ago. But this is the original. This is the game as it was \u2013 as it first existed, as American SNES owners first experienced it on the SNES in 1995. And spending just eight bucks to reclaim that same experience \u2013 old poorly translated enemy names and all \u2013 is, to me, the best of what the Virtual Console has always been about."

        "Content": "It almost seems rude to call Super Mario Galaxy 2 a sequel. Unlike most games that get the follow-up treatment these days, it simply isn't interested in the modern day mantra of bigger, brasher, more. In that respect, it's a follow-up bereft of marketing savvy, favouring subtle refinement over seismic innovation. That's selling things a bit short though and Nintendo hasn't simply delivered a gently messaged second helping of the original. Instead, it's scrutinised those brilliant concepts at the heart of the first game and added layer upon layer of dazzling invention around them.  Sure, there are new additions in Mario's latest adventure - some small, such as new Rock and Cloud power-ups, and some genuinely significant extras like Yoshi's much-welcome return. But Super Mario Galaxy 2's true success lies in its slavish dedication to the purity of Mario's platforming legacy, shaping a richly inventive, deeply rewarding adventure around that lean, classic core.    With countless iterations of the same formula stretching back almost 25 years now, it seems that radical game-shifting innovations simply aren't necessary anymore. Nintendo's had decades to perfect its craft and Mario's smallish set of movements - as joyously fluid and richly responsive as ever - have proven themselves time and again by now. It's that rock solid foundation that's enabled Nintendo to run rampant this time around - and the result in Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a game that charms and beguiles with its bold, bright parade of wild ideas and glorious surprises.  At first, it's all extremely familiar - almost underwhelming so - as Nintendo deftly reintroduces the basics of its gravity-bending platformer. Even its opening flourish feels like a half-hearted redux of Super Mario Galaxy's wondrous introduction and its first few levels offer a slow retread of Galaxy's hoop twirling and planetoid surfing. Yes, it's as beautiful as ever but there's not that instant, irresistible charm.    Perfunctory reintroductions out the way though and Super Mario Galaxy 2 suddenly catapults into a frantic, full-on assault of masterful design and ingenuity. Your first taste of this comes in the form of Yoshi. While Super Mario Sunshine brought the scaly green fella back as little more than a cameo, he's a genuine bona fide game mechanic this time around.  He's got his trademark hover jump and tongue grab but that's just the beginning. Using the Remote pointer, Yoshi latches onto objects, swinging through the air, and it's amazingly tactile and hugely satisfying. And, as with all of Mario's tricks this time around, these impressive opening gambits build and build as you go further into the game, fruits physically transforming Yoshi to open yet more possibilities as he floats skyward or races along impossible, stomach-churning tracks.   It's the same story for new power-ups such as the Rock and Cloud Mushroom. Simple in concept, the former turns Mario into an unstoppable wrecking ball while the latter offers the limited ability to create new platforms and paths, but they're stretched to creative breaking point as the game storms on. Even familiar elements like the Bee, Boo and Spring Mushrooms are given a new lease of life as Nintendo finds increasingly devious uses for them. It's genuinely draw-dropping at times - actually, scratch that, relentlessly so.  It's a key theme to this sequel - nothing ever outstays its welcome, meaning you're always left clamouring for more. It makes for an experience that's utterly compelling in its generosity, making virtually every other game we've seen in recent times look positively miserly in comparison. Even Galaxies themselves flash by in the blink of an eye this time around. Whereas the original Galaxy followed the familiar formula of its 3D predecessors, reusing large chunks of slightly repurposed levels five or six times to expand its adventure, Galaxy 2 rarely delivers more than half that amount of Star challenges before impatiently whisking you off to the next set of brazenly varied objectives.    Each gorgeously-realised world thinks nothing of tossing in a whole new take on gravity-defying platforming before casually casting it aside. Whether you're drilling through the earth to access increasingly convoluted pathways, flipping platforms from under your feet, scurrying across a much-expanded selection of side-scrolling courses or timing your progress to a gravity-switching metronome, it's all incredibly intuitive and brilliantly accessible thanks to myriad tweaks to Super Mario Galaxy's original formula. Controls are tighter, as is the camera, and there's plenty of assistance when the going starts to get tough, reintroducing some of Super Mario Bros. Wii's optional handholding for series newcomers.  Galaxy's been refined across the board in fact, with this sequel ditching its predecessor's charming but convoluted hub world in favour of more traditional 2D branching pathway progression. It's a move that does, in our eyes at least, rob the experience of some of its more delightful exploration elements but streamlines the series into a leaner, more breathless endeavour. The first game's more glaring faults have been addressed too, such as the infuriatingly flighty Prankster Comet challenges, now unlocked by collecting medallions in each level, which stay where they're put once revealed.    There's also the small matter of the first game's relative lack of challenge. Previously, it was a breeze to beat the game - or at least watch the credits roll - with its more fiendish moments held back for more persistent players. That's all changed this time around though and Galaxy 2 is never afraid to halt progress with a blindingly evil bit of design deviousness. Interestingly, Star quotas are a little more stringent this time around if you're to unlock the pathway ahead, meaning you're frequently forced to backtrack and dig deeper into each galaxy if you want to continue.  If there's one area that irks with Galaxy 2, it's this. Particularly as the game reaches its latter half, those much-needed Stars are often tied to Prankster Comet challenges, offering slightly remixed versions of levels you've already completed. With only a handful of variants - including speed-runs, coin grabs and sudden-death boss battles - they're one of the few areas where game elements outstay their welcome. They also offer some of the toughest challenges in the game, meaning you'll be playing and replaying them an awful lot. That's but a small criticism in the grand scheme of things though and one that's only possible to make in a game that consistently spoils with its relentless churn of glorious inventiveness."

        "Content": "Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. Without question, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-ass foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.  Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic. Much of the credit goes to the artists at Rockstar North who created as believable a city as possible. Liberty City is inspired by New York, but not beholden to it. While there are many parallels, Liberty exists in its own universe and rightfully so. Many open-world games have cities that feel as if they existed only from the moment you first turned on your console, but Liberty City looks lived in. It's an old city and each block has its own vibe and its own history. Drive around Liberty City and you'll be able to identify each individual block. Though Liberty is filled with brownstones and a myriad of similar brick buildings, you can tell one from the other, just as you can in New York. Go to an affluent neighborhood and the street is likely to be newly paved, the pedestrians better dressed, the cops more plentiful. But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying on the weak.  Niko is fresh off the boat. Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents. Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship. Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself.  You never have to be alone. A high-priced call girl is always at the ready. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored. To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade.  The explosions are wicked. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight. This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough. There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.  You don't need a posse to rule the streets. Just a bat and balls of steel. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good. The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller.  GTA IV plays out like a high-octane action flick. Michael Bay just got served. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary. Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location. Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next. I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact.  Is it suicide if you take someone with you? You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.  The world is yours online. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud. If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from.  A meeting of the online minds. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it. And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer. As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing.  The Special Edition Those who want a little more bang from GTA IV can purchase the special edition for $89.99. Packaged in a large, attractive cardboard box, the Special Edition includes some nice swag, but lacks the traditional \"Making Of\" DVD that generally proves most enticing for gamers willing to shell extra cheddar. GTA IV: The Special Edition includes the following:   Metal lock box with GTA IV logo embossing  Rockstar Duffel Bag  Soundtrack Sampler  Art Book  Rockstar key chain  Standard copy of GTA IV  The duffel bag has a nice yellow lining and a large Rockstar logo. It's big enough to fit a cat or mob boss's head. The lock box is the better container. This non-descript metal box is the perfect place to lock up your game to keep it away from children. There's enough bonus space to hide rolled up Playboy's and your relaxation medication. Perhaps this is what Al Gore was going on about back in 2000. Makes sense now. There is no official soundtrack box set for GTA IV, because songs can be purchased individually through the Rockstar Social Club. So getting 16 of the best tracks on one CD is actually a pretty solid deal. You'll get the GTA IV instrumental theme along with a new Nas song, Busta Rhymes and Mobb Deep. I'd still rather have a full-fledged soundtrack release, but this is the next best thing.  Worth the extra $30? Complete track list:   Michael Hunter - Soviet Connection (Theme from GTA IV)  Mobb Deep featuring Havoc & Prodigy - Dirty New Yorker  The Rapture - No Sex for Ben  Munga - No Fraid A  Busta Rhymes - Where's My Money  C.J. - I Want You  Joe Walsh - Rocky Mountain Way  Bob Marley & The Wailers and Damian Marley - Stand Up Jamrock  Seryoga - Liberty City: The Invasion  Greenskeepers - Vagabond  Electrik Funk - On a Journey  Qadir - Nickname  David Axelrod - Holy Thursday  Nas - War is Necessary  Fela Kuti - Zombie  Global Communication - 5:23  Lastly, there is the art book, which features concept art, wireframe models, screenshots, and a small amount of insight into the art design process. It's not going to be enough to satisfy those who want to understand what it takes to make an epic such as Grand Theft Auto IV, but it's all you're going to get. Should you get GTA IV: SE? That depends on what you expect from a collector's edition. The lack of a making of DVD is a major letdown -- so if insight into the creative process is what you're after, save your $30 and buy the regular game. If you like chotchkies, then there is a little more for you. The duffel bag is average, but the lock box is pretty swank. It's certainly the best case for a collector's edition that I've seen. I won't deny that the soundtrack has some great songs -- but great enough to add a $30 value to GTA IV? That's a tough call. The game is no less great, but the Special Edition is only for those with money to burn and a desire to have a metal box to lock their game inside each night."

        "Content": "How can Grand Theft Auto IV ever live up to the expectations bestowed upon it? From its first unveiling over a year ago, hype levels have been steadily escalating towards the stratosphere, and surely it would be impossible for Rockstar to satiate the lust of those deprived of a fresh Grand Theft Auto experience for nearly four years?  It's clear that this iteration of Grand Theft Auto is a markedly different beast to its predecessor San Andreas, and whatever your feelings about the last outing there's no doubting the series' new direction works towards creating a more immersive experience. Nearly all vestiges of videogame signifiers have been shorn away and for once it's perfectly valid to state that playing the game is akin to watching a cinema blockbuster. The HUD has been refined, appearing only when Niko is engaged in action, and the omnipresent map at the bottom left of the screen is often all that remains to remind onlookers that this is an interactive entertainment.  Videogame artefacts such as hidden packages have been omitted \u2013 though those who have a fetish for collecting need not worry, as in their place is a series of collectables of a more naturalised manner - and the jumps that have long marked out the Grand Theft Auto games are more subtly implemented. Indeed, it was only after a few hours play that we realised they were still there, so well camouflaged they were amidst the architecture of Liberty City.   The explosions are truly breathtaking, leaving impressive smoke trails in their wake. And what a creation the city is. Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City is one of the finest worlds we've seen in gaming since we gallivanted around the Hyrule of Ocarina of Time. It's a world that lives and breathes with its own authenticity, and with an effortlessness that has rarely been glimpsed in gaming to date. A storm comes in and the lighting engine paints the streets of Broker with a melancholic taint, with passers-by erecting their umbrellas in the downpour and those more ill prepared raise their suitcases above their heads and run for cover, while in the background a lone saxophonist plays under the shelter of a band stand. The sun shines and the streets burst into life, light rays bouncing off the pavement and glistening over the bonnets of traffic. The level of detail informs every aspect of Liberty City, with even the most secluded alleyway exuding its own atmosphere and conspiring to make Grand Theft Auto IV's world one of the most complete witnessed to date.  This whole world is painted with its own distinct perspective - yes, this is a more realistic Grand Theft Auto than ever before, but it's also one of the most stylised entries, with a filter applied to the graphics attaining an effect that's akin to pointillism and at times can seem almost impressionistic. That's not to say there aren't occasional dips in framerate or texture creep, but none of this ever impinges on what is undoubtedly one of the most achingly beautiful videogame creations to date.   The HUD never proves intrusive to the action. Above all it's a gritty creation, with the more down to earth and grimy nature of Niko's story reflected in each brick that builds Liberty City. At the beginning of the game, when confined to the Broker District by a terrorist threat, Niko can take a peek at what lies ahead of him in his quest, his view of the peaks of the skyscrapers of Algonquin filtered through the dirt of Liberty City that blights the lens. These details stretch to the interiors as well \u2013 this is a world of squalor, and no more is that evident than when climbing a flight of stairs to Niko's first abode in the slums of Broker, the strip lights humming and a muffled television audible through the door of a neighbouring flat.  This Liberty City is unmistakably a mirror image of contemporary New York, and with this fresh focus Rockstar has delivered one of its most potent satires yet. From the terrorist alert that initially locks down the city to the feeds from Weasel News that beautifully ape a certain real-life feral news service reporting on Niko's more outlandish escapades, to the mayoral election that is so brutally fought out over the airwaves between the fictional Michael Graves and John Hunter, it's never too difficult to ascertain the real-life sources for Grand Theft Auto IV's swipes. It's evident too in the bastardised internet that is accessible to Niko, which proves a deepening rabbit hole of increasingly hilarious skits on the online generation as you click through the countless sites on offer. The cultural references come from far and wide, one radio advert beckoning down the citizens of Liberty City to a show from the artists Simon & Miguel who uncannily resemble our own Gilbert & George in their pursuit of the eccentric. These satires stretch beyond the radio waves, with Niko able to unwind after a hard day's killing by settling down in front of the goggle box, and amidst the spoof history channels and histrionic chat shows we're sure we saw a none too subtle swipe at the Master Chief.    Of course no matter with what splendor the world has been created it's nothing without the means with which to explore it, and here Rockstar have supplied the most exquisite toolbox seen in an open world game. The euphoria physics engine takes centre stage, granting the world a physicality that connects players with the world to an unprecedented level. Niko feels more a part of his world than any other protagonist in a Grand Theft Auto title, be he brushing pedestrians aside or vaulting fences in an attempt to flee the police.  Combat proves a triumph as well, the new cover system flourishing gun fights with a level of sophistication that matches any other current generation shooter. The lock-on works reliably to snatch onto the nearest threat, and for those that prefer their shooting a little more freeform a light press of the trigger will enable free aim. Likewise, the cover system works as well as any of its peers, hugging Niko to any in game object and gifting fire fights with a much appreciated new depth.   Liberty City's friendly doctor at hand. With its extended subtleties, the new wanted system also substantially alters the way the game is played when Niko is under heat. As the stars escalate, so too does the circle on the map, accentuating the thrill of a chase as Niko desperately races to escape the area and seek respite. Find yourself submitting to the chasing police and Niko is granted one final get-out clause, with a swift button tap elevating him from his knees to maintain the pursuit.  Behind the wheel, the vehicles handling lends itself to more cinematic driving, the rear end of the majority of vehicles having a propensity to hang out to a degree which can be initially galling. It soon emerges that a more subtle approach is required to negotiating the right angles of Algonquin or the swerves and inclines of the later Aldernay isle, and it's no longer possible to fling a car around with blithe abandon. The extended detail of Liberty City also affects the way cars are used, with each road now adorned with its own texture which the car's springs respond to, be it a cobbled street in a suburban back alley or the pot holes than pockmark the streets of Broker.   Finding cover is imperative, and adds a welcome depth to gunplay. With these extended mechanics there's a variety to the vehicles that is now more pronounced. Front-wheel-drive cars will lurch towards understeer, their rear-wheel-drive counterparts allowing for some breathtaking slides. This variety extends not only to the models of vehicles available, but to the state in which you find them. Jack the wrong car in the excitement of a three-star chase and you could find yourself at the wheel of a misfiring beast, clumsily working its way through the gears and spitting out plumes of burnt oil.  In-car combat is another area that's been furnished with a suite of new features, not least of which is the ability to lock on to a pursued car, thankfully bidding farewell to the sometimes chaotic chases that blighted previous Grand Theft Autos, and with the added capacity to free aim from the drivers seats vehicular combat is no longer the headache it used to be.  That's not to mention the myriad other ways to traverse the breadth of the city \u2013 and despite any initial fears of Liberty City's size in light of the offerings of San Andreas, we can assure you it is vast \u2013 such as taxis or helicopters. Hail a taxi and you'll get the option to either skip straight to your desired location, or sit back and enjoy a spectator's view of the city, complete with typically irreverent commentary from your driver. Get yourself behind the controls of a helicopter and prepare for a vast intake of air as the full splendour and scale of Liberty City is offered up in widescreen majesty.    And the story itself? We'll leave the details for you to discover at your pleasure, but needless to say this is a tale more melancholic and mature than some of the hyperactive extremities of the series' past. Niko himself is sure to become a videogaming icon of our generation, an embittered ex-soldier with a murky past that marks itself in his weariness, yet also informs his hard-edged yet ultimately humanist perspective on the brave new world of Liberty City. It's no longer a rags-to-riches story, with the narrative more nuanced and all the more affecting for it. Indeed, so pervasive is Niko's story we found it informing the way we approached the game, finding ourselves less inclined to indulge in mindless rampages we deemed out of character for our Eastern European protagonist.   WIth it's ability to transform the city, the lighting engine is one of the stars. This is all aided by a wealth of characters, all painted with a remarkable clarity and all serving to bolster the strengths of the main story. Naturally their stories are predominantly told through some sterling cutscenes which benefit from the enhanced engine that mercifully never outstay their welcome, and like everything else in Grand Theft Auto IV the scriptwriting has been ratcheted up to a degree previously unprecedented in the medium.  But the most rewarding way with which to interact with the cast is through Niko's phone, an item that soon emerges as a core tool in the interaction with the game's characters. As friends are picked up over the course of Niko's travels, they begin to offer social invitations \u2013 and in one of the game's many superb touches an incoming call will disturb the radio of any car he is traveling in \u2013 and it's easy to get drawn in to each of their narrative arcs. The activities that are open are widespread and well implemented, be it the bowling game that offers surprising depth or less interactive pursuits such as cabaret or the comedy club - which contains a number of surprises it's again best left to discover for yourself. Perhaps most notoriously there is also the option of visiting a bar, the results of which never fail to entertain as Niko spills erratically on the street before stumbling his way home.   What GTA's really about - a five star melee. Whilst these prove entertaining diversions, they also provide a framework for the burgeoning relationships in the game which very quickly begin to matter for the player. It's genuinely heart-breaking to turn down a friend requesting a drink, as it too is genuinely surprising when on our second date with one of Grand Theft Auto IV's many love interests our beau noted how we had changed our attire since we last met.  Which means when the element of choosing who to favour in the game world Niko can be faced with some truly agonizing decision. At certain branches in the storyline he is faced with the option of pledging allegiance to certain characters \u2013 often to the fatal detriment of others. Though we're loathed to spill details, at one point Niko is presented with siding with a young upstart with somewhat dubious morals or his suicidal and life-weary nemesis who is fresh out of jail. Do you punish the fresh-faced gangster for his loose morality or put the melancholic ex-convict out of his misery? It's a choice that had us holding the gun to the head of our chosen victim for minutes of extended deliberation, and when the final bullet rang out it left a sick feeling in the pit of our stomachs as we were left unsure of our actions. The choices are never clear cut, and it reflects the murky morality of this Liberty City.    Again, the missions contain joys we'd rather not disclose for fear of ruining the experience, but rest assured they offer a variety previously unseen in Grand Theft Auto. From suiting yourself up for a funeral to scouring the internet for a potential date, they're essentially grounded in the reality of Liberty City and never work against the hard work of the narrative to create an immersive atmosphere. One mission in particular that occurs midway through the plot is sure to gain notoriety for the challenge it presents, an extended bank heist that for all its pains manages to provide one of the punchiest set pieces of the game that easily rivals the best Hollywood has to offer.   The sun sets on another day in Liberty CIty. But like previous Grand Theft Autos, some of the best moments occur when you step outside of the script \u2013 be it painting your own name on a car with bullet holes and riding into battle, or stealing your first helicopter and taking a night time flight to the strains of Queen's One Vision before stepping out into a deserted Algonquin and embarking on a 15-minute six-star chase. With the toolset provided, and with the game world so rich with opportunity, we're sure to be swapping tales of our antics in Liberty City for years to come.  Seeing Niko's story out at the leisurely pace it deserves will consume some 40 hours of play, all of which is supplemented by the dizzying amount of multiplayer options. It will be interesting to see where the hordes migrate to on online play, be it the thrill of vanilla deathmatch, the bedlam of team mafia or the serenity of freely adventuring the city with friends. Regardless, this is a package that will truly keep players enthralled well beyond the lifetime of its native hardware. "

This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV . The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. Without question, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-ass foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.   Be sure to watch the debut video review here. Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic. Much of the credit goes to the artists at Rockstar North who created as believable a city as possible. Liberty City is inspired by New York, but not beholden to it. While there are many parallels, Liberty exists in its own universe and rightfully so. Many open-world games have cities that feel as if they existed only from the moment you first turned on your console, but Liberty City looks lived in. It's an old city and each block has its own vibe and its own history. Drive around Liberty City and you'll be able to identify each individual block. Though Liberty is filled with brownstones and a myriad of similar brick buildings, you can tell one from the other, just as you can in New York. Go to an affluent neighborhood and the street is likely to be newly paved, the pedestrians better dressed, the cops more plentiful. But head to Dukes or Bohan and you'll find streets nearly stripped of asphalt, homeless people wandering about aimlessly and criminals preying on the weak.  Niko is fresh off the boat. Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents. Hang in one area of the city long enough and you'll see how traffic and pedestrian flow changes as the day progresses. When it rains, people bring out umbrellas or shield themselves with a newspaper and run for an awning. Cops chase petty thieves unaware that walking down the street is Niko Bellic, cold-blooded killer. There's a perfect balance of mumbling doomsayers to remind you that the reason this city never sleeps is because it's full of nut jobs. People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship.  Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself.  You never have to be alone. A high-priced call girl is always at the ready. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored.  \"The idea of a 'living, breathing city' has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place.\" To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade.  The explosions are wicked. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough.  \"There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge.\" There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.  You don't need a posse to rule the streets. Just a bat and balls of steel. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good.  The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller.  GTA IV plays out like a high-octane action flick. Michael Bay just got served. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary.  \"The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out.\" Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location.  Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next.  \"That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world, runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel.\" I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact.  Is it suicide if you take someone with you? You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.  The world is yours online. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud.  If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from.  A meeting of the online minds. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it.  \"Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends.\" And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer.  As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing."

People go about their day, only altering course when Niko inserts himself into their lives with his crappy driving or excellent marksmanship. Liberty City isn't as big as San Andreas, but is far denser. There's a lot to see and do and, like New York itself, very little wasted space. When you enter buildings, there are no load times -- you open the door and you're on your way up a flight of stairs to the roof. The only frustration is that there are literally thousands of buildings in the city, but most of them cannot be entered. With the exception of some clearly marked entertainment hot spots and mission-specific areas, there's nothing to indicate which buildings are open for business. So you might find yourself walking into a lot of doors trying to find which one will magically open. It's a little much to expect to have the interiors of every building rendered, but that doesn't make it any less bothersome that you can't go where you please. The idea of a \"living, breathing city\" has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place. And its history is built not only into the architecture and the people, but even in the music. There are more than 200 songs in GTA IV and many of them were recorded or remastered with specific references to Liberty City. You'll hear songs on the Classics station referencing the city, as if to suggest there's decades of history built into the culture. The soundtrack is an unbelievable blend of rock, pop, reggae, R&B and hip-hop. But more astounding is how well the songs and the DJs blend into the city itself. It's this level of integration that makes Liberty City such a believable place. You won't just hear \"America's Next Whore\" advertised on the radio; you'll see posters when walking down the street and spot ads on the Internet. GTA IV takes aim at all of the modern forms of communication. Along with radio stations (a staple of the series) there are full programs and ads you can watch on TV and a fully browseable Interweb. You could lose hours of your day surfing the 'net. That may mean sorting through junk mail, clicking on random links, using Love-Meet.com to find dates, or reading the news. There are multiple websites that cover news based on missions Niko's completed. You can read different takes on these events if you want to get an idea of how your actions are perceived in different political corners. You might never bother looking at all, but like so much of GTA IV, there are dozens of hours of content waiting to be either discovered or ignored. \"The idea of a 'living, breathing city' has always been somewhat of a joke in gaming. Every city in the past has felt artificial in some way. But Liberty City feels like a real place.\" \u201c To make itself more modern -- as opposed to Vice City and San Andreas which were \"of an era\" -- the focal point of Niko's world is his cell phone. You'll receive calls and text messages from friends and business associates on your phone. This is the mission delivery system. You may launch into a mission just by answering a call, but more often you will be directed to meet at a specific location to initiate your next objective. Or you might just have a conversation that serves no purpose other than to deepen the characterization of Niko, his friends, or even his enemies. The good news is that, just like in real life, you can talk on the phone while driving your bus through a police blockade. The phone is also used as an organizer to remind you of critical events (dates with slutty online girls) and can be customized with new ringtones and wallpapers. And just as in modern life, the phone can become a nuisance. Date Carmen and she will constantly be ringing your digits and sending texts checking in to make sure you aren't sleeping with some other girl. Yes, there are needy people even in Liberty City. You'll also get casual calls during missions. You can always ignore the ring or you can pick up. It's most likely a friend calling and asking to hang out. GTA is a clever game brimming with hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue and Niko will almost certainly have a pun-laced response to turn down a pal if he's in the middle of a helicopter dogfight. This doesn't mean you shouldn't give your potential friends the time of day. Throughout Niko's journey you'll have the opportunity to strengthen your bond with some of the people you meet. It's not necessary to take your Jamaican braddah Little Jacob out for a drink or game of pool when he calls, but doing so is to your benefit. If someone likes you enough, they'll give you access to their special ability. For Little Jacob, that means being able to call him day or night for discounted weapons. Packie, the angry Irish wannabe mobster gives you car bombs. Dwayne sends a pair of his homies to assist you on missions. The benefits of taking friends out on the town go beyond these tangible attributes. Friends also provide commentary on life, the city, Niko, and the story. None of it is essential to completing the game, but all of it is fascinating. The dialogue in GTA IV is rich, funny, brilliant, insightful, and engaging. So many times your reward for beating a mission isn't a new weapon or an elaborate cinematic cut-scene -- it's just dialogue. That is often reward enough. \"There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge.\" \u201c There are a number of places you can take your friends when you go out on the town and you should base your decision on what they might enjoy. There are mini-games for darts, pool, and bowling. But you can also check out the god-awful cabaret or watch one of several comedy sets by Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams. Perhaps the most challenging (but satisfying) activity is going drinking. Your level of drunkenness is relative to the person you take out. Little Jacob and Dwayne aren't so bad, but take a sweet lass like Kate out and she'll have you (literally) falling over yourself. When drunk, it's difficult to walk and even more of a challenge to drive. You don't have to drive drunk (in fact, it might make you ill doing so as the camera sways as if you're out at sea), but it's fun to give it a try. Drunk friends tend to be more revealing as well. Kate will tell you what she really thinks of you with just a few drinks. If that doesn't weaken your self esteem, nothing will. The only issue with making friends is that it's a distraction from the main story. For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique. Some are loveable, but there are many who are despicable. There are cringe-worthy conversations, where you see Niko being sucked into the depravity of these peoples' lives to earn a few bucks or gain a long-sought revenge. That's a credit to the writing, to make what would normally just be some thug you're doing missions for earn your contempt. That's a mark that you care for Niko; that the story has gotten to you. There aren't many games that can pull that off. As an added twist, GTA IV gives you occasional morality choices. There are people that you don't have to kill in a mission and you can decide whether or not to waste a bullet. These events don't change the plot or open new missions later on. Occasionally it affects dialogue, but more often it is simply the game asking what kind of person you are. And there are some gut-wrenching decisions you make at points that create an emotional response I never imagined I would get from a Grand Theft Auto title. There is one significant choice you make towards the end of the game that opens a new path and an alternate ending. There are two worthwhile endings to uncover and are incentive for playing through a second time just to see how much more depressing life in Liberty City can get. There are more than 90 story missions that will take anywhere from 25-45 hours to complete depending largely on your skill level. I was certain that the missions would get repetitive at some point, that sooner or later it would get redundant. It never does. Though many missions boil down to the same basic parameter -- go to location, kill people to get to target, chase target, kill target -- it never feels repetitive. The locations of missions, the variety in the enemies, the dynamic aspects of the AI, and the dialogue keep GTA IV from ever feeling stale. In fact, this is a game that can be enjoyed with multiple playthroughs. It's just that good. The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out. Instead, you and the gang must battle through the streets and into the subway to escape. It's a lengthy, epic fight that I could replay a dozen times and still enjoy. A great deal of that pleasure is due to the refined combat system. Though Grand Theft Auto has always been about action, it has never provided a great targeting system. That has finally, truly changed with GTA IV. Hold down the trigger and you can lock on to an enemy (or civilian). You'll see an indicator of their health. You can adjust your aim slightly with the thumbstick so that nudging up a little can help you earn some headshots. Partially depress the trigger and you have free aim, which is great for targeting tires or specific body parts. With skill, you can take down enemies faster in free mode. But auto aim is a great help in larger battles or for those who aren't as adept with a controller. Better is the cover system. Tap the right shoulder button and you'll take cover behind the nearest object. If you see it in the environment, you can probably take cover behind it. That includes walls, dumpsters and cars. You can aim while in cover and when you hold the trigger to fire, you'll pop and shoot. You can also blind fire rather effectively with any weapon -- including an RPG. The cover system is fairly smart, so if you want to move from one side of a door to the other, just push towards where you want to go and tap the cover button. This also works when you are fairly far from cover. Niko will roll or perform a slick slide to get to safety quickly. There is a stickiness to the cover system similar to Gears of War, but since the cover button isn't tied to your run button, you never accidentally enter cover. While GTA doesn't have many issues, I will admit that the cover system is not perfect. There are times where you will take cover on the wrong side of a corner, leaving you exposed. These instances aren't too common, but over the course of dozens of hours, you'll certainly encounter them. You also un-stick from cover when you use your phone, which can sometimes make calling Dwayne for backup or Carmen for a health boost a little trickier than necessary. \"The best mission comes close to the halfway point, when you and Packie McCreary decide to rob a bank. In what becomes the recurring theme for Niko Bellic, everything about the job goes wrong. The cops have the bank surrounded and there's no easy way out.\" \u201c Most games with a cover system make the mistake of turning cover into the central focus of gameplay. But cover in GTA IV is more of a natural progression needed to facilitate heightened AI. Enemies have a variety of AI protocols. Some are cowards (gotta love the fat cops running for the hills when you start killing the boys in blue), most try to avoid being shot by taking cover, and a few still stand in the open. If the AI is going to be able to hide behind cars and other parts of the environment, it's only fair that players have the same ability. You don't have to use cover if you don't want to. I'm sure there is some way to beat missions just by running and gunning. After all, this is still GTA. There's no one right way to beat a mission. You're free to get creative. But ignoring the cover system is like never stealing a car. This is a major piece of the game. Use it often, because it works well and it's certain to keep you alive longer. The cops aren't about to let Niko run through the city with guns blazing, even if he is capping bad guys. Sooner or later, you'll run afoul of the law. The wanted system has been revised and makes for more dynamic chase scenes. When you're wanted, your radar displays the police search parameter. The smaller the wanted level, the more local the search. Your goal is to get out of that circle and avoid being seen by the cops. Get spotted and the circle re-centers on your new location. This becomes more of a challenge when you reach three stars, because a police helicopter appears. This eye in the sky has an easier chance of spotting and following Niko -- and directing other cops to your location. Unless you want to be O.J., you need to change directions, get out of the sight of choppers, switch cars or go on foot. Whatever you do, avoid line of sight, because once a cop sees you, you're location is reported and the search changes its focus. This makes escapes from four stars and higher incredibly intense. Pay 'n' Spray shops still exist, but must be entered when cops aren't looking. To be honest, I used this one time in 40 hours. It's an outdated idea in some ways and more a nod to GTA's of old than a great resource. The new wanted system puts an emphasis on your driving and navigation skills. Fortunately, you can set a waypoint on the map in the pause menu and get an adaptive GPS-guided route. This same system is used to guide you through missions. There is never a point in GTA IV where you have to wonder where to go or what to do next. \"That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world, runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel.\" \u201c I should mention that the driving has also seen an upgrade from past Grand Theft Autos. Rockstar's RAGE engine coupled with NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine creates a game world with some stunning physics. Each brand of car handles differently (you can actually see the suspension in action as you make sharp turns). What will really surprise people is that these physics work with characters while in cars. So Niko's weight shifts to one side as he makes a turn and his head snaps forward when he slams the brakes. There is also a full neurological system built into Niko so that his body knows how to react to other objects. At one point I drove an ambulance off a high stunt jump. The cinematic camera swung around to show Niko taking his hands off the wheel and covering his face before impact. You will see the effects of NaturalMotion throughout the game, whether it's how bodies react when you slam your car into them or the way a gangbanger leaps away from a grenade. The physics system is the connective tissue that grounds the action into something resembling reality. And it's one of the main factors that makes GTA such an impressive-looking game. Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing. The art team gets major kudos for creating a living world. There is great texture work in the environments, a nice field-of-vision blur of buildings in the distance, some excellently modeled cars, ball-jarring explosions, phenomenal water effects and one interesting-looking Eastern Euro for a lead character. Sure, it's not a game that runs perfectly all the time, but the technical elements almost never get in the way of the gameplay. For those wanting to know which version looks better, the edge goes to the PS3. The textures and framerate are comparable, but the PS3 has far less pop-in. The 360 has richer colors, but the PS3 has better anti-aliasing making it look a little cleaner. Because GTA IV can preload onto the PS3 hard drive, the in-game loads are faster. Don't worry Xbox owners, the load times are rarely more than 30 seconds and don't occur very often. The slight visual edge goes to PS3, but the 360 is no slouch. Either version will do you proud. If you're wondering which version to buy, the best suggestion is to consider what your friends will purchase. That's because online multiplayer has made its way into GTA IV and it is awesome. And, like all great things, it's best played when drunk and with as many friends as possible. Multiplayer is accessed via your phone from the single-player game. Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends. To keep you and your pals from getting separated, GTA IV offers a party system. The party lobby is actually set in the outskirts of Liberty City. You're given plenty of guns and some vehicles to mess around with. You can stay and fight or run around the city if you like while waiting for the host to set up a match. And boy, are there a lot of options to choose from. There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals. There are a number of other creative multiplayer offerings. The standard Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch can be interesting, since the cover system often slows the game a bit so it isn't as fast-paced as something like Quake. Unless, of course, you choose \"all rockets\" in which case death will become you many, many times. Mafiya Work has you and your competitors receiving phone errands from a mob boss. First to complete a mission scores some cash. Car Jack City has players vying to steal specially marked cars and return them in as pristine a condition as possible to a drop off point. Turf War is your standard capture-the-point. Or if you like vehicles you can try out GTA Race, which is like any other racing game except you can get out of your vehicle, jack your competitor's car and finish the race in any way you like -- or just blow up other people for the hell of it. \"Everything is active in Liberty City online -- the cops, pedestrians, traffic, and weather. And yes, the entire city is open to you and 15 of your closest friends.\" \u201c And then there is Cops n' Crooks, the best of the objective-based multiplayer games. This has two teams, one side lawmen, the other hoodlums. The crooks are trying to get to a randomly selected extraction point and the cops are trying to arrest them with bullets. This mode forces teamwork, as both teams must strategize on the fly and rely on one another to assist in navigation. It's a fun, addictive mode that will likely be the most popular of the team offerings. On top of the various competitive modes, there are also three co-op offerings. These three \"modes\" are missions similar to what you might experience in the single-player game. Niko doesn't exist in multiplayer, but you still get cut-scenes and some unique dialogue wrapped around some fun missions. Co-op supports up to four players and only has some minor variables. Your objective never changes nor do the locations. You can up the difficulty and add more traffic if you want a challenge, but none of the co-op missions struck me as anything worth playing more than a couple of times. It's nice to have, but probably won't be what gamers buzz about when discussing GTA multiplayer. As with just about every game, there are both ranked and unranked matches. Ranked matches are the only way to progress up the ranking system (from 0-10). Progressing up the ranks not only makes you feel better about yourself, but it opens up new clothing and accessories to better customize your character. There's not a lot of pull to rank up, though, because many of the modes don't use your custom character. The co-op modes and Cops n' Crooks use a different cast, so if those tend to be your primary focus, having new outfits for a character you never see isn't going to mean much. I won't go so far as to say that GTA IV is the best multiplayer out there, but it's definitely among the best. Having Liberty City in full effect and only seeing occasional instances of slowdown is a real treat. When a few million people load hop online, it's anyone's guess how the game will hold up, but from my experience, playing with 16 people in Free Mode only caused occasional hiccups. Certainly not enough to make me stop playing. For those curious about SIXAXIS controls, there are in full force in GTA IV. You can guide boats, bikes and cars tilting the controller. This only works well with boats, however, as bikes are far too squirrelly for the clumsy movements of SIXAXIS control. Helicopters are also very tough to control in this fashion -- it's as if Rockstar thought they were making a game about dragons. The mini-games, particularly bowling, also work with your guided movements and handle well. If you want traditional controls, you can turn SIXAXIS off for each individual input -- from the various vehicle types to reloading guns to specific mini-games. It's worth giving SIXAXIS a shot, but most likely you will shut this off."

        "Content": "In just two months, IGN Wireless will celebrate its four-year anniversary. For almost 48 months, I have reviewed hundreds upon hundreds of mobile games and it's been a fascinating trip. I've looked over old reviews to see just how fluid scores really are in the rapidly changing world of mobile. With new handsets released monthly and new tech amplifying the things developers can do with mobile gaming, it's simple to say that 9.0 score in 2004 would certainly not equal a 9.0 today. Expectations change, hardware changes -- review scores are a snapshot of what's happening at that moment. Unlike, say, the PlayStation 2, which has the same guts today that it had in 2000, the first mobile phone I used in 2003 would now be considered a dinosaur. I still have it, too: Samsung N400. It's slow. The screen is washed out. The thumb pad has a terrible delay. But playing SEGA Monkey Ball on it in 2003? That was a feat.  What does this have to do with Tornado Mania ? I have been saving that perfect 10 rating for almost four years for a game that I finally believed would transcend the rapidly moving mobile arena. This is a game that I believe will be just as fun two years from now as it has been these last few weeks. It is a game that truly captures what mobile gaming is all about: Short bursts of clever fun, easily picked up by any player of any age or skill set, and builds on an innovative concept that no console game maker would bet the quarterly budget on. Mobile represents a wonderful landscape where developers can try out new, fresh ideas -- and that's been the mission of Digital Chocolate . The firm should be extremely proud of what they've accomplished in the space. From Tower Bloxx to Rollercoaster Rush to Mafia Wars: Yakuza, Digital Chocolate now refuses to coast. Tornado Mania is, to me, the culmination of the spirit that drives both mobile and Digital Chocolate -- a genius concept executed upon with brilliantly simple controls and excellent challenge-reward mechanics. It deserves this 10.  As you might expect, you control a tornado as it twists and turns across the world, swallowing everything in its path, from poor cows to massive skyscrapers. How you control the tornado is so simple. The tornado sweeps around the screen in a clockwise arc, always moving. If you don't touch anything, it moves in a good-sized circle. Pressing the OK key makes the tornado spin counter-clockwise. After just a few moments of practice, you can send that tornado snaking across a farm by pressing OK rhythmically. Encircling buildings just requires you to move into a building's range and then know exactly when to release the OK key so the twister surrounds it. And that's it. But from this simple control scheme springs an engrossing, incredibly creative game.  Tornado Mania is really two games in one -- making it a huge value, which has become of paramount importance to me -- a construction-oriented \"god game\" and an arcade-y romp where players are tasked to leave nothing but carnage in their path. Utopia, the construction game, plots out the efforts of a mad scientist to create a paradise from elements of the rest of the planet. Every year, the scientist sends out his industrial-produced tornados to scoop up buildings to perfect his paradise. At first, you just pick up small buildings, like a residential. However, to maximize the happiness of the utopian citizens, you must install industrial, cultural, and commercial buildings, such as museums and energy plants.  This segment of the game plays out like the city-planning element of Tower Bloxx, but greatly amplified. You must play around with paradise and discover which buildings make the happiest place on earth. No two utopias are likely to be the same, too. Every time you play Tornado Mania, you'd likely have to work to replicate the previous paradise.  Collecting these buildings is very, very fun. When the scientist sends the tornados out to get buildings, you rush into a variety of landscapes full of grasslands, roads, buildings, and other objects. To pick up a building, you must make the tornado rotate around it enough to loosen the foundation. When you position the tornado in the proper path, a small icon shows you how close you are to pulling up the building -- plus how much physical damage you are causing if the tornado's orbit is too close on one side. Smashing into buildings causes damage and if you destroy a structure, it's lost. The larger your tornado is, the easier it is to pick up larger, more important buildings. But to increase your tornado size, you must reach goals back at the biosphere paradise. Challenge and reward, my friends.  As intriguing and addicting as it is to create paradise by ripping up buildings, sometimes you just want to unwind with a little uncontrolled chaos. That's the essence of Rampage Mode, the second half of Tornado Mania. You hit the ground running with a massive tornado and a time limit. To move on to the next screen, you must destroy all of the buildings in the area. The first few maps are pretty straight-forward, but soon Rampage Mode becomes something of a puzzle game. You have to really chart out the best way to flatten the landscape before time runs out. Complications ensue when helicopters zoom in to drop dry ice in the tornado funnel, reducing its strength. You cannot destroy the chopper -- you must avoid them.  When you destroy buildings, you often reveal power-ups. A lightning bolt increases the tornado's speed. The heart increases the tornado size (very helpful if you've just been downgraded by a dry ice attack). The clock adds time to the meter -- always make an effort to grab these. The funnel icon gives you small satellite tornados that swirl around your main twister. These smaller tornados help destroy buildings, but more importantly, absorb damage from dry ice attacks.  Each of the game's halves is equally entertaining -- there are no dull moments in Tornado Mania whatsoever. I loved alternating between destructive bents and laying out my biosphere. Both of these modes were thought out, nothing feels just \"tacked on\" for the sake of having extra content. Everything snaps into place.  Tornado Mania enjoys some of the best production values in Digital Chocolate's history. First, I have to call special attention to the music. I like the Tower Bloxx theme an awful lot and the music samples for the club DJs in Nightclub Empire are great, but the score in Tornado Mania is superb. The track that accompanies the tornado as it rips up a whole city is excellent.  The graphics are smart and clean, but what amazed me in Tornado Mania are the little details. The tornado is constructed of layered discs that move independently of each other, giving it some real depth. When the tornado really starts tearing it up, you see elements from the things it lifts circling the outside of the funnel. If you wreak havoc in a pasture, you see cows and fence pieces in orbit. When you plow into a building, bits of the brick and mortar surround the funnel. The rest of the artwork is great, too, such as building design and the use of bright colors. This is a very pleasing game on the peepers. "

        "Content": "If you read my review of Oracle of Ages you already know how I feel about these two games. They are, in short, the best games ever made for the Game Boy Color (yes, that includes the excellent Pok\u00e9mon series). In fact, they are a couple of the most complete, enthralling games currently on any system. That said, Oracle of Seasons is much like its Ages counterpart. The story is fairly similar, but don't me wrong --it is an entirely different quest with completely new challenges, items and characters.  Features   Quest that lasts dozens of hours  Battery back-up  Interacts with Oracle of Ages  Only for Game Boy Color  Just as everyone's favorite Hyrulean hero Link shows up in the land of Holodrum, so do the forces of evil. Onox, the General of Darkness, arrives and kidnaps Din, the Oracle of Seasons (and quite a good dancer, to boot). Using the Oracle's power over the change of the seasons, Onox hopes to throw Holodrum into chaos by jumbling the order of seasons. His evil hope is that by doing this, everything will rot and fall to darkness. He imprisons Din within a crystal and places her atop the Temple of Seasons. According to his plan, Holodrum begins to fall to ruin. It's up to Link to save the land! While this story won't win any awards for originality, it is simple but elegant. The quest unfolds with whimsy and wit, and more than a little suspense. The \"gimmick\" to Seasons lies within the Rod of Seasons, a magical sceptre that is capable of altering the environment. All you need to use it is a magic stump. Like the Harp in Oracle of Ages , the Rod of Seasons adds a new dimension to gameplay. The map and its contents are altered slightly each time the season changes, allowing Link access to new areas, new items and more adventure. I shudder to think what would happen if they ever combined these games, putting both the Rod and the Harp in play at the same time. It would be madness! Insanity! Like Ages , Oracle of Seasons also boasts a couple of brand new items, which can be obtained while battling through the eight Dungeons hidden around Holodrum. The coolest of these is the Magnetic Glove. When worn, Link can attract and repel metal. Some of the best puzzles in the game revolve around mastery of this ingenious device. Another item that isn't available in Ages is the classic boomerang, which allows Link a long-range attack (and an ally in tripping hard-to-reach switches). As the quest progresses, you'll get a steerable version of the boomerang, which is quite helpful in some of the later Boss fights. All of the Mystical Seeds are here as well. They give Link the ability to shoot fire (Ember), attract beasts (Scent), solve clues (Mystery), go faster or freeze enemies (Pegasus) and warp around the map (Gale). Equip them in the Slingshot to make these magic nuts projectiles to shoot at foes. The Mystical Seeds add an extra little boost to the quest, making the adventure even more fun to unravel. If I were to pick which of the two games is more difficult, I would say Ages . If you were to buy one of the two, that is the one I would suggest. But if you buy them both (and this is highly recommended), play Seasons first. It is a bit better as an introductory game. The one element that is perhaps more difficult about Oracle of Seasons is the final Boss fight. In general, the Dungeons are a bit easier to solve and the Bosses a smidge easier to fell. But I have to say, Onox is superior to Veran in many ways. I won't give away details of either battle, but be warned -- This guy can wear out your thumb. Of course, Seasons is able to link with Ages , as described in the other review . This provides for a good deal of extra gameplay (including cameos by favorite Zelda characters who have not yet appeared in either game), making the two games an even better buy. Of the two, Seasons is also the more vibrant graphics-wise. The various seasons play out in full Technicolor and even Link seems to shine a little brighter against the panoply of hues. Seasons also contains the wonderful world of Subrosia, one of my favorite realms in any Zelda game. Sound is pretty much a draw, as the games use similar themes throughout."

        "Content": "It's been said that the two new Zelda offerings for the Game Boy Color will be the last great games on the system, given the imminent rush to Game Boy Advance. But it is also accurate to say that the GBC saved the best for last. That is, there are no two games better than Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons currently available on the system. And there never will be. Not only do the games capture everything that makes Zelda great, they are just right in terms of difficulty, game length and compatibility. In short, the Oracle games are the pinnacle of what can be created for this type of system. We can only hope that games as good as this find their way to the Advance. Individually, each of these titles would be the ultimate, but the fact that they both ship on the same day is unbelievable.  Features   Quest that lasts dozens of hours  Battery back-up  Interacts with Oracle of Seasons  Only for Game Boy Color   Oracle of Ages is a bit more complex and involved than its Seasons counterpart. The story is similar, even though it takes place in the mystical land of Labrynna. The evil sorceress Veran has possessed the body of Nayru, the peaceful Oracle of Ages, who controls the flow of time. Using the Oracle, Veran goes back to the past to build a tower that will block out the sun and allow evil to spread across the land. It's Link's job to restore order by tripping through the tunnels of time with the help of a magic Harp. The way the Harp changes the world is amazing. As time shifts back and forth from Present to Past, the map changes with it. As you master new Harp tunes, you'll be able to shift the flow of time back and forth so that you can access new parts of the map. This is a slick gameplay feature that really enhances the quest. As with every Zelda adventure, you'll see puzzles and objects early in the game that are inaccessible. But as you collect Items and Tunes, you'll eventually access every area in the land. In addition to the Harp, the special Items Link collects in Ages are innovative and fun. Some, like the Switch Hook, Roc's Feather and the Bracelet, you'll remember from Link's Awakening . Others, like the Mermaid Suit and Cane of Somaria are new to Ages . Each of the Items you receive helps you immediately. The game makes good use of almost every Item it introduces. Boss fights often hinge on whatever Item you picked up in the Dungeon. And as you progress through subsequent levels, Items don't get forgotten. You'll need them all the carry you through to the end. Mystical Seeds are new to the Zelda universe, and they are a dandy addition. These magical seeds can be found on Mystical Trees scattered throughout the realm and used in two different ways: straight out of Satchel or shot from the Seed Shooter. There are five kinds in total, and using them correctly will be one of the keys to surviving the adventure. All of your old animal friends have made their way back to the game: Moosh the blue bear, Ricky the kangaroo, and Dmitri the sea lizard each contribute to your adventure. In addition, the Zora, Tokay and Goron races are represented, as well as all of the old enemies. Octoroks, Leevers, Tektites, Moblins--all of the creatures that graced the original NES version of the game--are also here, as well as a few new faces. Generally, the monsters you'll meet in Labrynna are fairly wimpy, with the exception of a few sword-toting Soldiers, which can be tough to take down. As with all other Zelda games, you progress through a series of adventures that take you to eight Dungeons that are scattered throughout the land. In each Dungeon, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles in order to work your way through the maze, collecting Keys, Items and Rupees along the way. The puzzles were (for the most part) fresh and fun. Of course, there are the usual stumpers here as well. But if you're like me, you love the challenge. What's the fun of beating an easy game? At the midway point of each Dungeon, you'll battle a Mini-Boss. While some of these fights are quite simple, others require ingenious schemes and considerable skill. For instance, to fight the mole Subterror, you have to pop him out of the ground with a Shovel, then finish him off with your Sword. It is the same with the Boss fights. They are set at just the right level of difficulty. You'll likely fight a Boss a couple times before learning the secret to beating him. For instance, late in the game there is a Boss made of iron. It took me about four turns before I figured out I had to use my sword to bat his hands back into his face. I like this kind of learning curve. Not only does it extend gameplay, but makes me feel I've earned something by getting to the next level. The pace at which the quest unfolds is perfect. Just as you're getting mega-frustrated with a puzzle, you'll figure it out. Just when you think you've been everywhere, a new area will open up. It's a masterpiece of game design. The story elements are pretty standard for a Zelda game, but this is more nostalgic than bothersome. Besides, there's only so much you can do with story on this kind of format. In addition to the main quest, there are a couple of extra things to do. There is a sort of side quest that revolves around trading items with the various colorful characters scattered throughout Labrynna. This makes use of almost every character in the game, and results in getting an upgrade to your Wooden Sword. The other thing you can do is collect all of the Rings in the game. This is quite challenging, as several of the Rings are quite rare. You'll find them in chests and hidden caves and receive some through character events. But to get the most rare, you will have to master the art of planting Gasha Seeds. This can be done only on specific patches of soft soil located throughout the land. Plant a seed, leave it for awhile, then come back to find a fully-grown Gasha Nut. When you pluck the Nut, you'll find a new Ring (or power-up) inside. The more remote or odd the planting location, the rarer the Ring you receive. This quest for Rings adds a collection element to the game and makes for even more gameplay. The fact that you can swap Rings using the link cable adds a Pokemon feel to the game, which isn't bad. The thing that makes these games unique and extra fun to play is the linking feature. There are a couple of ways to do it, but each revolves around beating the game several times. When you conquer Ages , you will be given a password to start Seasons with. If you begin the second game with this code, some special features will be unlocked. First off, there will be more encounters with NPCs (non-player characters). Some of these will lead to Passwords, which can only be used after you complete this game, then replay Ages . These passwords will send you on short errands to retrieve secrets, that in turn give you valuable weapon and item power-ups. The linking also leads to three extra boss battles at the end of the game. Here, you'll get a chance to take on the witches Twinrova and the main baddie Ganon. It will also give you the opportunity to see Princess Zelda in a scene that does not exist in the non-linked game. As far as graphics go, they are above-average for the Gameboy. The colors are vibrant, the characters are quirky and as detailed as possible for the GBC. The environments are nice and big and the maps are well-done. Bottom line: it's as pretty as anything on the system. The sound is not mega-impressive, but what GBC sound is? The melody that accompanies gameplay starts out being whimsical and fun, but wears you down by the twentieth hour of gameplay. Still, the sound is better than a lot of the tinny fare that normally emits from the Game Boy speaker."

        "Content": "It's time to catch 'em all...again. Pok\u00e9mon, easily Nintendo's biggest property ever to hit the Game Boy shows up again in a special edition for Pikachu fans. This game is essentially a re-issue of the two original Pok\u00e9mon games (Red Edition and Blue Edition) that showed up in the US around this time last year. But a great game in another package is still a great game, and if you haven't been introduced to the game that started it all, Pok\u00e9mon: Special Pikachu Edition is your best bet.  Features   Updated Pok\u00e9mon adventure using the existing Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue engine  New Pikachu-related elements  Follows the cartoon story  Game Boy Printer Support  Works with Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue  For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  In case you haven't noticed it, there's a little craze going on in the world with these guys known as Pok\u00e9mon. It doesn't matter if you love 'em, hate 'em, or drop-kick 'em, you've at least heard of them, and they're not going away anytime soon. Pok\u00e9mon started, believe it or not (and you'll be amazed at how many people don't realize it) as a Game Boy RPG back in 1996, in Japan. After two incredibly successful years as a game, a TV show, and a huge merchandise license, the big wigs at Nintendo decided to bring these little guys to the US. And guess what? It caught on like a cold. And chances are, you've caught it as well. Here's the deal in Pok\u00e9mon: you're a kid named Ash (which can be changed within the game, but for now, you'll be known as Ash), who dreams of being a Pok\u00e9mon master. So, you leave home to fulfill your dream. You'll travel from town to town, defeating each town's Gym master with the Pok\u00e9mon you've captured and trained, until you earn all the badges necessary to be considered a Pok\u00e9mon Master. Pok\u00e9mon is a very traditional oriented Japanese RPG \u00bf overhead view, super deformed characters, tile-based dungeons, random creature encounters...the works. The appeal of Pok\u00e9mon, however, is the sheer amount of personality in the game. There are literally more than 150 Pok\u00e9mon to uncover and capture, and your collection becomes a status symbol \u00bf how many Pok\u00e9mon have you found? Or, more importantly, how many Pok\u00e9mon have you captured? See, when you encounter a wild Pok\u00e9mon, you must do battle with it \u00bf and the only way to do battle with a Pok\u00e9mon is with another Pok\u00e9mon. Each of the game's Pok\u00e9mon has its own strength and weakness, its own attack and defense capabilities. All Pok\u00e9mon belong to one of fifteen categories, and some types of Pok\u00e9mon can utterly destroy Pok\u00e9mon in other categories \u00bf Fire to Water, Water to Rock, and so on. It literally becomes a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors as you try and discover which Pok\u00e9mon works best against others. And the Pok\u00e9mon you've caught can be traded between your friends \u00bf in fact, that's the only real way you're going to be able to catch every single one. Just like Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, there are about a dozen Pok\u00e9mon you'll never be able to find in Yellow. Okay, so that's Pok\u00e9mon in a nutshell. What does Pok\u00e9mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition bring to the table? First of all, the story of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue has been altered slightly to mirror the cartoon. In Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, you had your choice of three Pok\u00e9mon at the start of the game. In Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Professor Oak captures and hands you Pikachu as your first Pok\u00e9mon. Because Pikachu is a rather rare and powerful Pok\u00e9mon in the game, Pok\u00e9mon Yellow is slightly easier to play since battles are a lot easier to win \u00bf but during the first big battle with Brock, Pikachu is useless, so you're best to capture as many other Pok\u00e9mon and train them before the first Badge battle. And like the cartoon, Pikachu doesn't like being housed in a Pok\u00bfball \u00bf so he follows you around like a companion. He cannot be traded, or let go, and he will never evolve. You can check out how well you're treating your Pikachu by \"talking\" to it \u00bf this will bring up a window showing its mood. Take pride in knowing you're taking care of it. Because the game somewhat mirrors the cartoon, the graphics have been altered a bit. It's nothing major \u00bf Brock looks like Brock in the cartoon, and Jesse and James from Team Rocket now make an appearance. Other small tidbits have been added, like Jigglypuff showing up to sing the Jigglypuff song (putting Pikachu to sleep in the process). Speech has been added \u00bf when you use or talk to Pikachu, it'll say its trademark \"Pika!\" \"Pi!\" or \"Pikachu!\" in crappy, low quality digitized audio. It's obvious the existing game engine was never meant to have speech \u00bf and the sound quality shows. Game Boy Color support has been improved a bit, but it's still not the most colorful portable game out there. In Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, when you played the game on a Game Boy Color each game had a blue or red hue throughout the adventure. In Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, the color palette changes depending on what screen you're on -- battle sequences are slightly more colorful, and you'll notice the color change as you walk from town to town \u00bf the color switch is pretty obvious. Pok\u00e9mon Yellow will most likely be the last game from Nintendo to not feature true Game Boy Color support. Finally, Pok\u00e9mon Yellow features Game Boy Printer support so you can create stickers of the creatures you've seen or caught. Essentially, this is simply a screen dump of the Pok\u00bfdex, including text that describes the Pok\u00e9mon you printed out. It's not a big deal, but it's a cool little feature."

        "Content": "There are only a few games that are a must-have on the Game Boy Color. The Legend of Zelda DX,  Tetris DX , Super Mario Bros. Deluxe ...now add Mario Golf to that list of titles. This game is an absolutely brilliant rendition of golf, and a perfect game for the go.  Features   Tournament, Match, Practice, and Adventure modes  RPG-style storyline  Transfer Pak compatible for N64  Link Cable support for two players  Only for Game Boy Color  Mario Golf for the Game Boy Color was designed and developed by Camelot, the same Japanese development house responsible for the absolutely awesome Hot Shots Golf on the PlayStation, as well as Mario Golf on the N64 released back in July of 1999. What the Game Boy Color rendition is, is a 2D-ized version of the golf interface the company is known for. The Game Boy Color can't handle 3D graphics like the PlayStation and N64 hardware, so the company put the perspective mostly in an overhead viewpoint, other than the behind-the-character perspective when you're ready to hit the ball. This incredibly deep golf game features four courses and ten different characters, three of the golfers are Mario veterans: Mario, Luigi, and Wario (hidden). The game excels in features and options that cover most every golf base there is \u00bf tournament, stroke, and practice modes. But what you really want to do is take one character and build up his abilities by winning tournaments and individual challenges from the clubhouse pros. Only then will you acquire all the hidden goodies this game has to offer. Like most golf games, Mario Golf depends on the \"timing\" interface to hit the ball. You first have to aim your shot and decide what club you want to use \u00bf and you can also opt to use a limited number of power shots. Once your target has been selected, you begin your swing, timing the powerbar to how strong you wish to hit the ball. On the downswing of the powerbar, you time the button push to the marker which determines how accurate the shot will be. Too early, slice. Too late, hook. The putting interface is very easy \u00bf look at the slope of the land (easily definable by the dark green arrows) and aim your shot accordingly, making sure you give it enough power to get the ball to roll the distance. I can spend dozens of paragraphs going through every little option of Mario Golf, but space and time is limited. But one feature that really floored me is how much stuff is saved onto this cartridge. Not only does it keep track of the standings of three individual players you've created, but it will remember 20 of the best shots in the game. Score an awesome eagle, and you can watch it again and again in the Status menu. It also remembers tournament standings, character matches, experience points and trophies earned. When you play through the game as a single character, it isn't just about being the best on the course \u00bf Mario Golf features a detailed RPG-style adventure where you wander the land finding challenges on the way to each of the four golf courses. In one challenge, you have to help a girl gather golf balls thrown all over the course by hitting them into a circle patch of grass on the green. In others, a golfer will challenge you to a single shot to get as close to the pin as possible. It's these challenges that really give Mario Golf a ton of replay value. What's more, the character that you build up on the Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf can be transferred over to the N64 version of the game through the yet-unreleased Transfer Pak peripheral. When you plug the Game Boy Color cartridge into the Transfer Pak and the Transfer Pak into an N64 controller, you can copy the character data over to the N64 version of Mario Golf. In essence, the character you created is completely playable in 3D on Mario Golf. What's more, whatever you do with that character on the N64 version of the game can be recorded onto the Game Boy cartridge. You can even transfer all the character standings from that Nintendo 64 cartridge onto the Game Boy cartridge, having a statistics report that you can carry along with you. Graphically, I have to say, the game could have looked a little better. The colors just aren't as detailed as many exclusive Game Boy Color titles. It's almost as if the developer decided to make the game Game Boy Color exclusive at the last minute. But vibrant colors or no, the graphics do their job \u00bf you can easily see the hill slopes, trees, water, and the tiny ball and characters. The RPG-style adventure even has that Japanese look with big-headed characters and small bodies. On the audio side of things, there's no digitized sound effects \u00bf and the music is just bippy versions of the tunes found in the much more vibrant N64 version of the game. But for Game Boy standards, Mario Golf meets and exceeds what's expected."

        "Content": "I'm reviewing Soul Calibur in a somewhat biased state. Soul Edge was probably my most favorite 3D fighter of all time. I loved it for its graphics, its unique weapons-based fighting system, its surrounding story, which brought together characters from different eras of history, its tremendous variety, and its phenomenal soundtrack. Throughout the latter part of the Saturn's life, you could easily spot me arguing with Saturn fanatics about how much better Soul Edge looked compared to Virtua Fighter II , and I'm still willing to defend that statement. So, Soul Calibur obviously had a lot to live up to. While a few glitches here and there and an occasionally bad piece of background music would be easily forgiven in any other game, my expectations of Soul Calibur were such that there'd be no similar leniency. I was expecting a damn near-perfect game. And guess what? True to form, Namco has indeed delivered the level of perfection I so longed for. Not only is Soul Calibur the finest fighting game I've ever played, but, with possible exception to titles such as Sonic and NFL 2K , it's also the number one reason to buy a Dreamcast later this year.  Where, oh where to begin? How about with the feature of the game that makes me far more interested in playing it than playing Virtua Fighter or Tekken : the story and characters. It all begins, apparently, with Cervantes, the evil pirate, and an apparent misunderstanding about the intentions of a particularly powerful twin sword, the Soul Edge mentioned in the first game's title. The game brings together characters from varying backgrounds and time periods, all of whom are seeking this Soul Edge for one reason or another. There's Sophitia, who worships, as all good Greeks should, Hepheastos, son of Hera, and knows the Soul Edge to be evil. There's Seung Mina, who left home in search of the Soul Edge, which she thinks to be a savior sword. Most interesting of all, though, would be Seigfried, who becomes possessed of the Soul Edge, and transforms into the Evil Seed. If any of this sounds foreign to you, then, you ought to obtain a copy of Soul Edge for your PlayStation and play through it like a madman. Or, just head on over to soulcalibur.com, and read through all the interwinding character biographies and storylines. If you don't find yourself intrigued, then may Pallas Athena herself take mercy on you.   Of course, try as a might, some people just won't take interest in the storylines or characters. There are the graphics nuts out there, for instance, whose interest in the product will be for nothing more than its graphical splendor. These individuals can take solace in the fact that Soul Calibur is a indeed a beautiful game. In fact, it's probably the most graphically impressive title you'll see on the American DC this year (only NFL2K has managed to impress me as much). There's just so much detail in the characters, more than in even Sega's own Virtua Fighter III (arcade or home). You'll see smooth curves, stray strands of hair, and free-flowing pieces of clothing. The characters, when viewed closely in the hidden profile mode, show some definite polygon edges, but when viewing them in a fight, which is how you're supposed to actually be viewing them, you'd be hard-pressed to tell that you weren't looking at perfect models.  The best part of the game's graphics, though, doesn't lie in its models, but rather in its animation. A quick look at the hidden exhibition mode, in which the characters practice their katas (fighting patterns) will reveal a level of animation closer to reality than has ever been successfully achieved in the arcade or home. The characters during these sequences move with unprecedented grace and beauty (well, assuming the character is supposed to be graceful, that is), and when viewing an actual fight, you'll see the same level of animation splendor. The game is actually much improved over its arcade counterpart in this area. I believe I'd only need to show off Xianghua's kata in order to sell the game, and the Dreamcast on anyone (the kata is actually available for download below). The backgrounds aren't as impressive as the characters; in fact, most of the Virtua Fighter III backgrounds have more depth and complexity than the Soul Calibur ones (the notable exception to this would have to be Soul Calibur's Venice stage, which seems to be the most beautiful 3D environment of them all). Still, though, the entire package, complete with the incredible lighting, shading, and reflection effects, come together as console gaming's current graphics leader.  The Venice stage is stunning, but, on the whole, the VFIII backgrounds are more impressive than those of Soul Calibur. Aurally, things are just as good, with a few exceptions. Thankfully (remember, I wouldn't have stood for it in any other way), the game features a legendary score, of the same caliber as the first tile. Everything has been re-recorded to take advantage of the DC's streaming audio abilities, so the result is a symphonic score that will bring a tear to your eye. Also adding to the aural quality is the voice acting. Namco has chosen to keep everything in Japanese this time, and the result is some top-notch spoken phrases by the characters. I will admit that certain characters sound strange speaking Japanese (Sophitia, for instance, sounded more Greek when she was speaking English in the first game), but the Japanese voice actors definitely know their stuff. Sound effects too are, for the most part, a high point. The weapon sounds in particular are well done, but the effects for the characters and their weapons striking the ground sound way off. I was going to do a full ten page report (single spaced) on the story, graphics, and sound of Soul Calibur , but I figured you'd like to hear about more than just that. After all, you're not going to be just looking at the screen when you get your DC on 9/9/99, you're going to be playing the bloody game! Now, let me get one thing out of the way. I'm a hardcore fighting game fan, but I'm not all that good at playing fighting games. Let's see . . . I know how to do a fireball, a dragon punch, and a sonic boom, and I think I know what combos, chains, and floats are. I still don't know how to consistently do an aerial rave move in X-men VS Street Fighter , though, and when people speak of a SPOD move in Virtua Fighter , I wonder what the hell they're talking about! That said, I love fighting games, be it 3D, 2D, or 2D pretending to be 3D. A quick look at my game collection will reveal no less than 15 titles from the genre. I have plenty of fun, staying up late at night with my buddies, fraying with one another, and this comes despite the fact that I'm not skilled-enough in the genre to appreciate the complexity of something like Virtua Fighter . Well here's a little reality check for all you hardcore fighters out there. Most of the people who'll be purchasing Soul Calibur on 9/9/99 and after are probably in the same boat as I. I just wanted to make that clear before commenting on Soul Calibur's gameplay, as an effort to avoid the tons of hate mail from Tekken babies saying \"but it's the exact same game!\" and Virtua Fighter nuts saying \"But it's just a button masher!\" As it stands, and for what it's worth, I believe Soul Calibur to be, without doubt, the finest fighting game I've ever played, whether it be 3D or 2D. My reason for this isn't because I can do a 100 hit combo when I feel like it, nor is it because there's some sort of \"zen feel to the game,\" as is everyone's favorite quote for Virtua Fighter . No, I'm praising Soul Calibur because I've never had so much fun with a fighting game. And that's ultimately what counts, right?  Upon considering what exactly makes me have so much fun with the game, I've come to a couple of reasons that I should probably pass on to you. First off is the level of control you're given over the characters. I think I'll take Seung Mina , my favorite character (also my favorite character from part 1), as an example. This babiliscious Korean babe uses (according to soulcalibur.com) a Zanba-To as her weapon. I've been able to make her do so many different things with her blade, by simply using subtle d-pad motions and a few button presses. Some examples that come to mind include having her spin the weapon like a baton, stick it out in front of here in an apparent effort to knock the footing out from under her opponent, swing it in 180 degree motions from her left to right side, as well as a whole myriad of other things. I suppose this is no different from Virtua Fighter or Tekken , games which promise hundreds of moves from their characters, but it just seems to be so much more obvious, at least to the casual fighter like myself. I have a feeling that most of the people who purchase the game on 9/9/99 will feel the same way. Also contributing to this feeling of all-out control is the so-called 8-way run mode Namco has created. In Soul Edge , you were given limited ability to navigate your way around the battle field; you could move away and towards, of course, but you could also rotate around your opponent by using a button press. Soul Calibur takes this a lot farther by allowing you full movement through the arena in all 8 directions. There are some interesting things that can be done in the game when strategically using this 8-way run, and Namco has thankfully put a great deal of thought into its implementation. First off, the fighters seem to always face one another when in the 8-way run (unless, of course, one player just sits there like a monkey, not moving at all - this is something that the computer can be accused of, unfortunately), so it's easier to strike someone than it is in a fully free-roaming game like Power Stone . Also important is that your speed when backing away from an enemy is quite slow, so this form of movement can't be used for running away when you've wet your diapers. There are a couple of problems with the 8-way run, including the difficulty I have beginning the motion, and the awkward animation for some of the characters, but this is certainly a welcome feature. Beyond the massive sense of control, I'm also drawn into many of Soul Calibur's other gameplay features, including the ability to use your weapon as a means of repelling an opponent, the high speed pace of the battles as a whole, the ability to charge up your character (this replaces the cool-looking, but overall silly, single super-move of the first game). The game does have its share of problems, though. I miss some of Soul Edge's finer elements, like the paper-rock-scissors style weapon clashes, and I don't like how easy it is to float an enemy, nor do I like the ease with which characters seem to fall out of the ring. These problems are minor at best, though.  Everything else with regards to Soul Calibur can be attributed to the amount of care and effort Namco seems to put into all its home products. True to form, Namco has injected the home version of Soul Calibur with a whole host of new play modes and options. Immediately accessible are the practice mode, which Namco has made quite addictive by allowing two players to play simultaneously, the team battle mode, and the survival mode. All the other options are accessible by playing through the arcade mode and the Mission Battle Mode, the latter of which is similar to the Edge Master Mode of the first title, though not as well implemented. Basically, what you do is you pick a character and then travel around the world, battling various opponents under certain special conditions. For instance, you'll have to at one point battle Edge Master, but it's very difficult to connect a hit, as he's constantly blocking. The only way to defeat him is to use one of your character's unblockable moves; one hit will kill him, but pulling off the unblockable move isn't the easiest thing in the world. Other scenarios that come to mind include fighting while poisoned (your energy will slowly deplete), fighting an opponent who's energy slowly recovers, and fighting multiple opponents one after the other. Winning certain battles will earn you points which can be exchanged for pieces of artwork in the game's artwork gallery; opening certain pieces of artwork will, apparently at random, earn you the new options and mode. I'm not going to tell you how exactly these are gotten, as having them appear out of nowhere is half the fun, but here's a partial list of things I've found while playing through the game: a total of 18 characters (although I have no intention of ever using Yoshimitsu, Voldo, and Lizard Man, beyond the one time that you're required to use them), the 18 total stages, the liquid metal mode in which the characters assume liquid metal form (this looks UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE!), the three costumes for each character, a few additional weapons, about 300 or so pieces of high quality artwork (do I sense the subtle hint of a Soul Calibur animated series?), a mode which allows you to edit the intro (props for making Lizard Man the \"girl in the wind\"), and many other things that don't come to mind. I did get everything in the game (you know you've gotten everything when the title screen changes), but there are just so many things to get that it's almost overwhelming. You'll keep playing Soul Calibur in order to unlock these options, as they add so much to the game. I do miss the eight unlockable weapons per character from Soul Edge , and it's a little too easy to unlock things, but even still, Soul Calibur has been the longest one-player fighting experience of my life. Few games come to mind as \"required purchases,\" games that are so good that they have to be a part of your lineup. The original Soul Edge was such a game, and now Soul Calibur has earned a place alongside its brother. It may or may not be the most complicated fighting game out there - I'm not bold enough to make such a statement. I am bold enough, though, to state that I've never had so much fun with a fighting game than I had when playing Soul Calibur . -- Anoop Gantayat , who wishes Seung Mina would come to life, like in the classic Tom Hanks film Splash, only with Anoop as Tom Hanks, and Seung Mina as the mermaid."

        "Content": "Legend of Zelda. No other name in video game history can grab and shake your attention with such vigor. Ever since Link's first adventure in the mid '80s, the series has gained immense popularity, and rightfully so!  Because of the ingenious mind of one Shigeru Miyamoto, we have been able to journey through the land of Hyrule and beyond on several monumental occasions, and the experience found within each one has left a high watermark for other creators to look up to. Since its first arrival on the original Game Boy years ago, Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening proved that Nintendo's handheld system can have the same walloping punch as its own 16-bit funhouse.  And with entertainment in extreme doses, it's not amazing to see why, either!  No matter where your tastes lie in gaming, you can't go wrong with one of the most ultimate titles of all time.  And since the fourth installment in the series has been revamped in a new DX edition -- with plenty of extras for those of us with a Game Boy Color -- the hours of fun just keeps on going. Features Fully colorized version of 1993 classic. Three battery-backed save slots. Includes new GBC-only dungeon. Game Boy Printer Support. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Although there is but one mode in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX , there's certainly not a shortage of places to go, people to meet, or things to do.  Oh no, there's a much different tune to be sung the second after you wrap your thumbs around the buttons of your Game Boy with this sucker in the slot.  The moment you enter the solitary island of Koholint, you'll come to grips with just how humongous this portable adventure really is, and with dozens of characters and places to interact with, Zelda DX has a lot to boast. A long story short, you're the notorious hero Link who has set off on a personal voyage far away from home.  During a dark storm, your ship is destroyed by a blast of lightning, and you fall unconscious -- until you wake up under the care of Marin and Tarin, who point you in the right direction to begin what may be the most engrossing adventure yet!  Full of dark enemies, musical instruments, mysterious motives, and a sleeping fish, Zelda DX is gaming at its best, and is liable to keep you addicted until you answer the Wind Fish's ultimate riddle. Everything from the original version is here -- there's neither a place nor object missing.  In fact, the new DX edition has a bit more added.  In addition to the normal amount of dungeons, you'll be able to seek out and enter a special hidden one which, although short, gives veteran players seeking a new experience somewhat of what they're asking for. And since it's tailored specifically for the Game Boy Color and its newer hardware (it cannot be accessed without it), it definitely adds a bit more value to an old classic, especially since you receive a set of blue or red armor upon the dungeon's completion. The newly revamped Game Boy Color mode fits the restraints well, and bring to life what once dwelled in the realm of black and white. Throughout the color-enhanced version of Zelda DX , it can easily be inferred that Nintendo has reworked its magic to fit new standards.  Now that it looks much more like its original NES counterpart than ever before, Miyamoto's masterpiece holds water on an all-new ground, and it certainly shows.  A splash of color goes a long way, and there's little to be said otherwise. As for the other extras in the fourth Legend of Zelda , there are several. The most noticeable of the bunch would have to be the Game Boy Printer compatibility, which is certainly an interesting addition.  During many parts of the adventure, which aren't always easy to discover, your picture will be taken and stored in the Koholint photo shop, where you can drop by whenever you wish to view your picture collection.  And if you've got the compatible printer, you can make stickers from whatever photographs have been taken. The true challenge of this, however, is to find all the places where you get your picture taken.  If you can find every single last one of them without aid from a player's guide, you'll be a true Zelda Master indeed."

        "Content": "I never thought Smash Bros.\u2019 intense four-player multiplayer battles needed more fighters, but eight-player brawls have become one of my favorite modes in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Eight-player battles are local-only,  which is an unfortunate limitation, but if you get a group of friends together you\u2019ll fill these big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness happening in every corner. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing on a rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax that\u2019s genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: it\u2019s bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series. Smash Bros. Wii U wraps more than 30 years of gaming history together into an approachable brawler. Every fighter in the 49-strong roster uses the same button-presses to execute attacks and special moves, but each has their own distinct style that\u2019s fun to learn. It makes them simple to pick up and play, but also challenging to master. Bowser, for example, uses burly strikes and kicks to pummel foes into submission, while Smash Bros. newcomer Duck Hunt uses a tricky move set of clay-pigeon projectiles, explosive barrels, and attacks that make playful references to the 8-bit era. Add in iconic characters like Mega Man, Samus Aran, Captain Falcon, Fox McCloud, Animal Crossing\u2019s Villager, Pac-Man, Wii Fit Trainer, Link, Mario himself, and dozens of others, and you\u2019ve got something for pretty much anybody who\u2019s ever loved a video game. The attention to detail in every part of Super Smash Bros. is fantastic, and all of it is delivered at a speedy and smooth 60 frames per second. Mega Man walks using his signature awkward sideways-shuffle, and the new Mario Kart Circuit arena captures the zero-gravity look and feel of a Mario Kart 8 track. Items like the deadly Bullet Bill or POW Block stir up old-school Super Mario Bros. memories while also sending a satisfying wallop to opponents. With so many tiny details and references to observe, it\u2019ll take lots of hours to see everything Smash Wii U has to offer. Excellent moment-to-moment combat is the real jewel of this game, and the many ways it can be played, from the Wii U GamePad to classic GameCube controllers with an adapter, make it a gift that keeps on giving. The action scales incredibly well: two-player duels are tense, while eight players all trying to Smash each other out of the ring is complete chaos. Turning items off removes the random element, turning it into more of a test of skill. But that\u2019s just the beginning. The constant variety of the multiple modes keeps me playing. Event mode, for instance, makes learning new characters\u2019 moves easy by putting them in playful solo or co-op adventures. One of these is \u201cKeep \u2018Em Off the Ship,\u201d in which you play as Falco and go up to smash a squad of parachuting Mr. Game & Watch enemies out of the ring, and it provided me some great training for how to use the speedy character\u2019s aerial attacks. The mission text makes some hilarious references to video game history, but the skills I picked up hold equal value, and the addition of two-player co-op makes it even more fun. Modes like Classic, Special Orders, and All-Star take a similar approach, using diverse matches, fun scenarios, and specific rules to set up creative encounters, but each allows you to choose the level of risk and reward. Special Orders allow you to spend accumulated Smash coins on special event matches, where winning unlocks another trophy or a handy piece of custom equipment; the higher the difficulty, the better the prizes. However, losing comes at a hefty price torching most (or in some cases all) of the stakes, giving these matches special tension. Nearly every mode of Super Smash Bros. offers a set of unlockable rewards, and the only parts about unlocking them that aren\u2019t satisfying are the awkward menus and, more importantly, the stingy drop rates for custom special moves. Those swappable special moves alter the speed of Mario\u2019s Fireball or the properties of other special attacks, so they\u2019re pretty important and fun to mess with. The prospect of new custom equipment, special moves, beautifully rendered trophies, and more kept me playing for hours, even though Super Smash Bros. didn\u2019t really give me enough direction for how to actually unlock the prizes I wanted. The only mode that\u2019s a snooze is Smash Tour, which is effectively a mediocre virtual board game with too many boring parts. Four players take turns gathering up stat buffs, items, and characters in a build up to a final battle, which is a cool concept, but Smash Tour\u2019s approach distills the essence of this amazing brawler game into painfully short matches full of random elements that just don\u2019t have the same satisfying payoff or feeling of accomplishment. Super Smash Wii U\u2019s online modes offer lots of match types to play with, from tense 1-on-1 showdowns without items, to 2v2 faceoffs in Team Smash, with up to two fighters playing from the same console. Just like in Mario Kart 8, getting friends together can be a little bit of a hassle involving text messages because Nintendo\u2019s system doesn\u2019t allow for notifications. But once you\u2019re all set up, you can launch private matches with friends and unleash characters with customized movesets, or watch other players\u2019 strategies through handy replay and spectator modes. Sadly, eight-player Smash doesn\u2019t make the cut online, but four players is more than enough for a good brawl. This is also the first game to integrate with Nintendo\u2019s new toys-to-life, called amiibo. There are no figures in the box, so this is an extra purchase, but if you do buy in they\u2019ll add another, much smaller avenue of variety to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Computer-controlled figure players will stand in as opponents, and each one learns to defend itself as it levels over time. The investment required to reach max level is small (maybe three hours) and having a brutally tuned A.I. to unleash on your friends is fun to watch \u2013 but of course, sometimes my amiibo made some questionable decisions. I\u2019ve seen my fully leveled Mario figure wreck opponents, but I\u2019ve also watched in horror as it totally gave away the match. I\u2019m proud of my amiibo, but sometimes it\u2019s like dealing with a child that only listens half the time. title=More%20Reviews%20On%20IGN&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=review-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article"

        "Content": "Halo 4 is really Cortana\u2019s story. As usual, of course, the fate of the universe rests on Master Chief\u2019s long-dormant shoulders \u2013 the green-armored super-soldier has been on ice aboard the Forward Unto Dawn since Halo 3 faded to black five years ago \u2013 but this time our hero bears an even greater burden. Saving humanity is the easy part. In Halo 4, his more difficult task is rescuing Cortana from herself. She is slipping into rampancy \u2013 a condition that plagues all UNSC AI constructs after they\u2019ve been in service more than seven years. As their knowledge base expands, they eventually, as Cortana explains, think themselves to death. And that\u2019s the unexpected heart of Halo 4\u2019s greatness. The plot delves deeper into John\u2019s humanity than ever before, but Halo 4 is more about Cortana and the fight for her own \u2013 ironically enough \u2013 humanity. Amazingly, Halo 4 is not only a success, but a bar-raising triumph for the entire first-person shooter genre. And just how new developer 343 Industries has done it will surprise, delight, and excite you. label=Familiarly%20Unfamiliar It starts with a mesmerizing CG cutscene that flat-out knocks you on your ass. The lighting is flawless, subtle movements and animations abound, and it even goes so far that Commander Lasky (yes, the same Lasky we see as a teenager in the Forward Unto Dawn webseries) has crooked teeth \u2013 not the usual polygon-perfect Chiclet choppers that every other animated video game human has. It strikes a fine balance between old-school fan service and establishing context for new players, and it quickly segues into gameplay, where Halo 4\u2019s greatest strength becomes immediately apparent: its gunplay. Halo\u2019s weapons continue their trend of working in complementary harmony, where each gun has a purpose, and every situation a fitting firing solution. The inaccurate Promethean Suppressor and undesirable Covenant Storm Rifle proved near-useless at times, but Halo 4 still hits on a ludicrously high percentage of its death-dealers. The short-range Energy Sword or new Scattershot are great to pack alongside mid-range delights such as the DMR or Battle Rifle, which also pair nicely with the ferocious Sniper Rifle if you\u2019re into the long game. In the opening mission, Master Chief is thawed out and immediately put back to work shooting Covenant, evoking both Halo: Combat Evolved (it\u2019s set aboard an under-attack spaceship) and Halo 2 (the stage\u2019s major battle takes place in zero-G on the hull of the ship). Expect your jaw to drop at least once on every level of Halo 4\u2019s eight-mission campaign, especially after crash-landing on the Forerunner planet Requiem, emerging from the wreckage, and ascending a hill whose apex overlooks a gorgeous valley. It is your introduction to the planet you\u2019ll be spending most of the game exploring and fighting the new Promethean enemies on, an obvious callback to the unforgettable moment when you touched down on the Halo ring for the first time in Combat Evolved. label=Now%20Hear%20This Of course, gorgeous graphics are only one responsibility a console\u2019s killer app must bear. Perhaps equal to Halo 4\u2019s monitor-melting visuals is its bar-none, best-in-class sound design. If you think you\u2019ve heard Halo, check your ears and listen again. Nary a gunshot, MJOLNIR boot clank, or Covenant Elite\u2019s \u201cWort wort wort\u201d passes through your speakers without a significant, authoritative overhaul that lends an aggressive, testosterone-inducing punch to Halo 4\u2019s combat. Few game series are known as much for their music as Halo, and thus much has been made of British electronica producer Neil Davidge taking over for the beloved Bungie incumbent, Marty O\u2019Donnell. It\u2019s a bold shift \u2013 and probably wise of 343 to go in a tonally different direction rather than attempt to emulate O\u2019Donnell \u2013 but the results are mixed. The trademark monk chants are gone, and Davidge\u2019s moody tunes are complementary rather than additive. The new tracks simply aren\u2019t memorable and never elevate the action happening on the screen the way that O\u2019Donnell\u2019s bombastic scores did, though this may be intentional, as Davidge\u2019s compositions are decidedly atmospheric. label=Hello%20New%20Day Resplendent set-pieces are ubiquitous during your quest, matched by what is inarguably the finest Halo sandbox yet. Halo 4 feels much more open-ended and organic than Halo Reach\u2019s paint-by-numbers sequences because of its massive scale, scope, and freedom for possibility. Go it on foot, or take the Scorpion in front of you? Hop in a Ghost, or take the riskier strategy of trying to get to a heavily guarded Wraith? All of these choices exist in a moment, not a spectacular scene, allowing for emergent encounters dictated by the opportunities you seize. To be clear, Halo 4 certainly has its share of dedicated vehicle sections. The walking two-story Mantis robot packs a high-caliber machinegun alongside a rocket barrage. It\u2019s even sporting a mean foot stomp attack to flatten any Covenant or Promethean scum who dare venture within spitting distance of you. The time you\u2019ll spend behind its controls is both empowering and refreshing. Halo 4 also finally lets me do two things I\u2019ve always wanted to do in a Halo campaign: fight alongside other Spartans and fly a Pelican. It\u2019s a treat to blast Covenant Phantoms out of the sky with the silver bird\u2019s beefed-up Spartan Laser, giving a classic Halo vehicle its long-overdue moment in the sun. Furthermore, an amazing near-final sequence tips its cap to the Halo finales of yore \u2013 you\u2019ll know it when you see it and I dare not spoil it for you \u2013 even if it\u2019s very obviously reminiscent of another powerhouse pop-culture phenomenon. label=Digging%20Deeper All throughout, the Halo 4 campaign is paced better than any first-person shooter this side of Half-Life 2, deftly mixing on-foot combat, vehicle sequences, quiet story moments, and key Chief-and-Cortana interactions. That pacing is most evident on Normal difficulty, where you won\u2019t run into the patience-testing battles for the next checkpoint that define the Heroic and Legendary settings. The series has long been lauded for its brainy bad guys, and they\u2019ve gained a whole host of IQ points for Master Chief\u2019s return. As you\u2019d expect, the full smarts of Halo 4\u2019s brilliant enemy AI are most evident at higher difficulties. Vehicles get brought down to earth \u2013 sometimes literally, in the case of the Banshee \u2013 now that enemies are proficient at firing ride-disabling overcharged Plasma Pistol bursts. And the new Promethean aggressors are wicked intelligent without being unfair. Watcher units hover above the Knight infantrymen, acting as guardians and medics \u2013 if you can get around the protector\u2019s shield or return-to-sender grenade tosses, it can revive its allies. Halo 4\u2019s combat is about efficient prioritization: kill the Watcher before it can get to cover, and turn the Knights to dust before they can escape, all the while dodging fire from swarms of speedy wall-running Crawlers \u2013 dog-like denizens of Requiem that can only be shot in the face. label=An%20Imperfect%20Being%3F The campaign has few failings, but the primary annoyance is that a lot of great story content is left for the eight hidden Terminals. Unlike previous Halos, the Terminal tale here isn\u2019t a side-story, but rather it fills in important backstory for both the main antagonist and a key allied character. Worse, you can\u2019t view the videos within the game. Instead, you\u2019re directed to Halo Waypoint, which serves only to pull you out of the experience, literally and figuratively. On a related note, as much as Halo 4 delves delightfully deep into its iconic characters, it leaves a number of threads hanging. Why is Spartan-II creator Dr. Catherine Halsey in handcuffs in the intro? What did Master Chief\u2019s [spoiler redacted] do to him? How did [spoiler redacted] survive at the end? No doubt these will be addressed in the fifth and sixth Halos, but until then the discussions will be heated and the wait will be maddening. Halo 4\u2019s other drag is one that\u2019s only really evident on Heroic or Legendary difficulties: some of its fetch quest-y, flip-three-switches sequences feel like they artificially lengthen the game because of how long you can get hung up on them when the going gets tough. I spent upwards of an hour trying to trudge through one of them on Heroic, but when playing again on Normal I cruised through on the first try. At one point, Cortana even makes a self-deprecating remark about the repetition, which I recognized and appreciated. These are mostly just scrapes in the paint of Master Chief\u2019s MJOLNIR armor, however. His return in the Halo 4 campaign is a success of mission design, art direction, level design, technology, and story writing. Underpinning it all, though, is that irresistible combat. Some shooters get a few weapons right, or, like Sniper Elite v2, they build their entire experience around one facet like long-range. Halo, however, boasts the best of all worlds. As you\u2019d expect, this plays exceptionally well in Halo 4\u2019s robust multiplayer modes. label=Great%20Expectations No console shooter has a richer, deeper, more revered multiplayer history than Halo. So how does Halo 4\u2019s multiplayer suite live up to the legacy in 343\u2019s hands? It\u2019s golden. Halo has evolved, wrapping its multiplayer in an unexpected narrative context \u2013 the Spartan-on-Spartan battles are presented as training sessions aboard the UNSC Infinity ship \u2013 complete with more of the same visually arresting introductory cutscenes for both the adversarial War Games and the new Spartan Ops co-op mode. With Halo 4\u2019s immaculate weapon balancing and gun-for-every-situation combat strategies, it needs only a great crop of multiplayer maps in order to qualify for classic status. Fear not, as 343 packs War Games with 10 mostly stellar stages and three additional Forge-built battlegrounds. Exile leads the vehicle-heavy Big-Team Battle complement, Ragnarok shines as a Mantis-showcasing remake of Halo 3\u2019s Valhalla, and Haven is among the series\u2019 all-time finest small and symmetrical levels. Oh, and one of the official Forge constructions, Settler, is a smaller, crazier evolution of the franchise\u2019s most famous map that I absolutely love: Blood Gulch. Halo 4 might not have its instant-classic (a la Halo 2\u2019s Lockout), but this is an impressive collection of outstanding battlegrounds, with a seemingly greater emphasis placed on the large-scale, vehicle-inclusive levels that are Halo\u2019s bread-and-butter. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images Meanwhile, Halo 4 includes all of the same matchmaking, playlists, customization, and social options you\u2019ve come to expect from the series. The more visual lobby screen, where player cards depict each person\u2019s custom Spartan, is a bit more cluttered and difficult to parse through than previous Halos, but that\u2019s the only downgrade. Everything else is on par with what Bungie had previously established. The Theater returns virtually unchanged, as does the Forge editor, with its notable improvement being a magnet feature that allows you to more easily connect Forge pieces. That leaves Spartan Ops, a downloadable series of 10 episodic side missions for Gold subscribers, each of which include a lengthy CG cutscene. The first one spans five chapters, and it took about an hour to play through in four-player co-op on Legendary difficulty. As you\u2019d expect, the more friends you bring the easier it\u2019ll be \u2013 and, while it\u2019s perfectly enjoyable and makes for a good excuse to jump online with your pals once a week, once you\u2019re finished with each episode, it lacks the replayability and score-based incentives of the Firefight mode it replaces. However, the incredible pre-episode cinematics make the mode a must-play regardless, and it opens up a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons. So even if you only play each episode once, you can\u2019t complain about the fact that nine more weeks of downloads await you. label=The%20End%20of%20the%20Beginning After soaking in the new game, I am beyond thrilled to be so in love with Halo again, more than I\u2019ve been since Halo 2. Halo 4 is a masterstroke everyone can and should celebrate, and its two guaranteed sequels instantly make the next-generation Xbox a must-own system, with Halo 5 its most anticipated title. Halo has been rebuilt. It has been redefined. And it has been reinvigorated. The Xbox\u2019s original king has returned to his rightful place on the throne."

        "Content": "The Wild West; the great open plain. Dusters and saddle sores and bar fights; hard women and filthy men trading blows in the middle of a prairie field \u2013 this is the world of Red Dead Redemption , one of the finest video games ever produced. With it, developer Rockstar San Diego has deftly paid homage to a genre of storytelling at once familiar to fans of 'westerns', but also subverting it with a gamers' mentality \u2013 turning rough-riding and cattle herding into an engrossing gaming experience.  It's all too easy to drift into delicious hyperbole when dealing with a game so polished and considered on every front, just as it's easy to drift off into endless lists of Red Dead Redemption's manifold features. We'll resist and instead point you towards IGN's previews and features . However, perhaps one point should sit above all others when considering this review \u2013 and your possible purchase: Red Dead Redemption is arguably the finest game Rockstar has ever crafted.  The design ethic is unified and utterly convincing throughout, starting with the stoic and sarcastic lead character, John Marston \u2013 a family man who turned his back on the looser, criminal lifestyle \u2013 a past that's painted across his scarred and weathered face. Marston is coerced into working for the government, cleaning up the last of the outlaws he used to ride with. As we learn, however, there's more at play than simple election promises; 'redemption' is indeed a key theme \u2013 as is the protection of his family and lifestyle.  The turn of the last American century sets a perfect backdrop for the action (and inaction) that follows. The introduction of the motorcar, the first tentative steps towards flight and the gradual spread of industry all play off the horse-and-cart tropes we identify with classic westerns, forming a brilliant mix of old and new. That said, you'll be spending the vast majority of your game time pounding the dust on horseback or riding shotgun (in the classic sense) between Mexican arroyos and dry, fly-bitten ghost towns. The hook is, of course, that Red Dead Redemption is built formally around a (take a deep breath and wait for it) 'Grand Theft Auto' structure, constructed using Rockstar's own R.A.G.E. engine and imbued with shocking physicality and detail through beautiful integration of Euphoria's 'NaturalMotion' animation and AI technology.   Check out IGN's full video review above.  However, while making a direct comparison between GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption is all but inevitable in the minds of most gamers, what's important to note is how vast the valley of difference actually is, beyond the small circular map at the lower left of the screen.  Playing as one man against the world, Red Dead Redemption is a solitary, even lonesome experience at times. The pace is far slower than Grand Theft Auto IV, which will immediately strike some players as jarring \u2013 particularly those looking for a cheap thrill. But that is unquestionably Red Dead's greatest strength; it takes its time, tells a wonderful story and, although it asks you to enjoy the scenery, hoofing hundreds of miles from start to conclusion, it also makes intelligent concessions for time-thrifty players.  For instance, the saving mechanic revolves around pausing the game outside of any settlement (though, houses are also at your disposal), building a camp fire and resting. In the same stroke, you can also 'fast-travel' to any location you've discovered, thereby taking the legwork out of proceedings. That kind of mentality underscores the greater scheme in Red Dead Redemption. The purists (this writer included) will want to ride from point to point, taking in the masterfully designed landscape, rejoicing in the reactive AI and spontaneous encounters to be had, while gamers short on time or patience can hop in and chew on the meat alone. You're never penalized for this style of play \u2013 or any other, for that matter \u2013 and this extends to mission design, combat and importantly, ethics.  John Marston's moral compass \u2013 which is your moral compass, actually \u2013 never explicitly guides you down a clear-cut path per se. Instead, the onus is on you to complete the game as you see fit. If a dispute between a prostitute and a drunken, knife-happy patron strikes you as funny, walk on. If you want to intervene, hog-tie him with your lasso and leave him there. If your hackles are up, shoot him. Or her . Your infamy and honour are tracked at all times and any good deed or misdemeanour is tallied and weighed up against your running total \u2013 and the world reacts accordingly. People treat you differently \u2013 or opt not to talk to you at all, if your crimes are so severe and your reputation precedes you so greatly. Want to be a fearsome, immoral gun-toting robber of bandwagons and whorehouses? Want to maim the old man and collect his deed? Go nuts; but remember, that old man has family somewhere \u2013 and they can gun for blood just as easily. In fact, some of the game's most interesting structural moments come from early decisions that come back to haunt you.   Games of this beauty and artistic merit are rare. Thankfully, the gameplay is also stellar.  The politics and social climate of the time provide rich material for fascinating characters \u2013 something of a trademark within Rockstar's releases. While many are archetypal \u2013 the stern, strong sheriff and his bumbling band of deputies, the youthful Mexican belle, even grizzled Marston himself to varying degrees \u2013 the work done to imbue true depth and personality into even minor roles should be applauded. Some, like the grave-pillaging abuse-case, Seth, is equal parts revolting and instantly compelling to watch. It helps immensely that the voice performances within Read Dead Redemption are sterling to the point of shaming just about every other game before it.  Missions themselves also play off the era and unstable political climate; the most interesting part of the game takes place south of the border, where the Mexican people are in the throes of a social uprising, facing off against the force of the Mexican Army, with Marston stuck in the middle, trying to maintain neutrality. This is, beyond ordinary mission terms, a fantastic commentary on power and class. As in GTA, there are messages underlying the action and in Red Dead, the messages touch on everything from the place of women in society to the fallibility of the justice system in the very end.  Perhaps that's reading deeply \u2013 but with such attention to storytelling clearly being paid, it's hard not to lose yourself in the period. Farther north, back on US soil, the struggles are much closer to home; Marston is merely trying to track down his old gang and permanently 'disband' it. In doing so, players variously try their hand at a gamut of Wild West gunplay.  The Dead Eye system, which essentially toggles slow-motion on and off and is governed by a small meter to the right of the mini-map, is an evolving mechanic. Initially automatically targeting any foe or creature you guide the crosshair over, you eventually must manually target enemies with a tap of the shoulder button. This not only increases the difficulty nicely, in line with a gradual and near-perfect learning curve, but also frees up more creative sharpshooting choices. For instance, when in one of the many two-man showdowns, the player must draw arms and open fire before their opponent. You can opt to unload your six-shooter completely and blow them away, or take a more delicate and ethically sound approach \u2013 manually targeting the revolver itself, or wounding the foe, rather than issuing the fatal blow.   Again, this kind of clever gameplay design resonates throughout all of Red Dead Redemption \u2013 in everything from using your lasso to catch wild brumbies, giving real purpose to its inclusion, to the flexible auto-aim system that gives you just a few moments' worth of lock-on in which to take your shot before manual aim kicks in. The cover system is also in line with the industry's best for third-person combat, providing a context-sensitive area-of-effect near any wall, edge or waist-height object. Just get in close, tap the shoulder button and you'll slide into cover. Blind fire seems just that, however \u2013 mostly a random shot that holds little practical value \u2013 as it arguably should be, for the sake of realism.  Thanks to the revamped gunplay, later encounters with dozens of armed foes don't feel laborious or start-stop; the pace and progression are constant, with Marston often fighting alongside AI-driven cohorts who are equally sure-shotted and aggressive. Enemies generally display a decent level of awareness, though for all the polish applied, it's still odd to watch the same Euphoria-imbued foes stand squarely as their buddies are taken out with throwing knives \u2013 'silent' attack or not. Likewise, when we're  obliterating legions of horsemen in hot pursuit, we're pretty sure the social implications would fly in the face of the rest of the game's ardent realism, 'best intentions' or not.  Still, it's a small-potatoes concern in the greater scheme. The landscape of Red Dead Redemption is not a desert wasteland devoid of life and detail; even beyond the streets and stores of Liberty City, there is far more to do and see in rural America, and Rockstar has imbued the terrain with dozens of different types of activities. The people living off the land provide the most immediate access to events and action; the 'Strangers' scattered here and there offer Marston incidental missions to complete, items to collect and rewards to reap. Of these, the inventive treasure map system offers you a real reason to explore the landscape; the simple topographical and elevation sketches will plague your dreams as you pick your brain for the right landscape features.   Seth - one of Red Dead's more memorable characters.  And what a world it is. Such is the artistry of Rockstar's designers that Red Dead Redemption is utterly the most cohesive, organic landscape in a game, bar none. The game teases the scope and attention to detail within the opening moments, but it's not until you're galloping across the plains, then transitioning into and out of all manner of lavishly detailed homesteads, forts and dwellings \u2013 seamlessly \u2013 that you actually realize the scale of the technical accomplishment here. Outside of cutscenes, you'll never see a loading screen \u2013 or even a skip in the gameplay \u2013 as you ride around.  Within the roughly three acts of the story, you'll encounter a surprising variety of landscapes \u2013 each one perfectly realized. The dry heartland of cattle-herding and classic 'Tombstone'-esque towns sets the scene, but before long, you'll venture farther afield. The most arresting locales reside down south; astride your horse, you'll pass along a winding river and through painted canyons, between towering red rock formations and across white, sunburnt deserts dotted with cacti and Joshua trees. The native wildlife amble around, providing a viable source of income and, in the case of the bears and mountain lions, an equally viable threat to your wellbeing.  The colour scheme plays with the pastels of classic American frontier artwork; subtle depth of field trails off into the vast distance to great effect. As the sun sets, clouds throw god-beams of orange-gold light across the valley and the contrast-heavy shadows stretch in all directions around you. At night, countless stars slowly swirl overhead and storm clouds might roll in, leaving puddles in between the train tracks and visibly soaking any character unfortunate enough to be caught in the downpour.  Just as dynamic is the score, which draws its composition from all the filmic greats. Gentle guitar and harmonica fade in and out occasionally, rather than bombarding you with themes. As the action ramps up around you \u2013 you might get caught in the crossfire of five banditos dragging a victim down the central street of a town \u2013 so does the music up the tempo accordingly. At certain pivotal moments, Rockstar has even licensed a couple of very affecting pieces of music that act as a tonal backdrop. Entering the Mexican border for the first time, the sound of the world around you, your horse's clomping hooves and insect chirps fade down and the song kicks in. You're compelled to take it slowly and feel the impact of being one man, alone, on a horse, in the middle of the wilderness. It's genuinely moving stuff, even for old-salt cynics like us.   Saddle up and embrace Red Dead Redemption's rich multiplayer offering.  Such is the power of thoughtful, cohesive design; the presentational aspects serve to compliment the gameplay perfectly and they do; it just so happens that the gameplay is astoundingly polished and considered too. The process of unlocking new garb is woven into specific tasks to be completed and areas searched as fully as possible \u2013 again, giving you a reason to explore and play, rather than simply handing you a token achievement. Newspapers track your progress within the game world, dropping hints of your actions and their implications within the towns you traverse. At all times, you feel your deeds are connected to a bigger picture \u2013 and you're able to delve as deeply into the background details as you wish.  The same approach is taken with the multiplayer \u2013 itself an extension of the single-player experience. Nothing quite compares to the first time you saddle up and keep pace with four or five other cowpokes as dawn breaks across the plain. The opening moments of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, on the back of a BMX, pedalling through alleyways and traffic, feels like the most apt Rockstar-related comparison, but being a gunslinger on horseback exudes a certain kind of cool that gang warfare simply can't touch.  The 'Free Roam' mode is something akin to the drop-in, drop-out multiplayer of GTA IV, but with the flexibility to choose your game style on-the-fly. Essentially, you have the entire world at your disposal, and you can opt to start a gunfight, go exploring or hunting with friends, take on rival gangs and generally create as much mayhem as you'd like. Really, for those who find the narrative too slow to build (and surely there will be detractors), we'd point them to the multiplayer for their fix of rampant cannonball-bursting, Molotov-hurling chaos. The more traditional game modes are also catered for, and with the same kind of quick-draw lock-on, it's surprisingly challenging and rapidly paced. Certainly, there's an incredible amount of content on the multiplayer side; short of a features list, we'll simply assure you that it's as thoughtful as the rest of Red Dead Redemption. "

        "Title": "Persona 5 Review",
        "Subtitle": "A strong story and tremendous sense of style make this the best entry in the series yet.",
        "Score": 9.7,
        "id": "4034b0f8ace948e2f432b0e679c27223",
        "Content": "In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games, Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That\u2019s a bold move, and it\u2019s emblematic of the entire experience. As we\u2019re introduced to the complex yet approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven\u2019t been in a Persona game in over a decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series has been building to, with familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix. In what\u2019s by far the series\u2019 strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you\u2019ll attend class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts. These stand-out dungeons take place in \u201cpalaces\u201d created within the mind of each target, and Atlus takes advantage of this to set them in diverse and outlandish places. Unlike the procedurally generated halls of Persona 3\u2019s Tartarus or Persona 4\u2019s Midnight Channel, Persona 5\u2019s labyrinths are fully hand-built and feature unique puzzles and mechanics that vary with the theme of each dungeon and never repeat. A museum, for example, has very different security measures than a Medieval castle, and you\u2019ll find very different enemies in a pyramid than you might in a spaceship. Assembling pieces of secret codes to solve a bank vault\u2019s cryptogram or positioning tiles to interpret hieroglyphics feel almost like entirely different games. This gives each palace a sense of identity tied to the target and provides some smart, unpredictable story moments and challenges. Persona 5\u2019s sense of scope is staggering compared to Persona 3 or 4. \u201c Persona 5\u2019s sense of scope is staggering compared to the dungeons in Persona 3 or 4, with palaces easily double or triple the size of those games\u2019 areas. While Persona 4 has you run through linear hallways until you reach the top of a dungeon, Persona 5 has branching paths, networks of hidden rooms, doors that require puzzles to open, and even excursions to other parts of the cognitive world outside of the dungeon itself. Starting each new dungeon is a bit daunting, but solving puzzles and progressing to each new area offers a wonderful sense of accomplishment. While chemistry between the characters never quite reaches the heights of Persona 4\u2019s Scooby Gang vibe, Persona 5\u2019s more cohesive main story does allow each character to shine in individual moments instead, exploring troubled pasts like the loss of a parent to add weight to present day scenarios. This series has never shied away from exploring serious subject matter, and here it shines light on abuse by teachers, drug sales, suicide, and a host of other issues that are handled well and are at times extraordinarily moving. Each character\u2019s motivation for joining you is relatable and unique, and even each palace\u2019s target has believable conviction. An unrepentant drug dealer, for example, reveals an origin that doesn\u2019t necessarily justify his crimes, but fleshes him out into more than just a bad guy caricature. Battle in Persona 5 is a familiar turn-based formula, with melee attacks, ranged weapons, and magic attacks based on one of eight elements. A bit like catching Pokemon, you collect Personas that you\u2019ll use to fight, and each has its own unique set of skills as well as its own set of strengths and weaknesses. While each of your party members has one permanent Persona to use, the protagonist has the lone ability to hold multiple Personas at once. This means that you can acquire additional Personas to use as you progress, and collecting multiple Personas with different abilities is a fun way to tailor your play style to the type of combat you prefer. You can also fuse combinations of Personas to create new ones, which allows you to inherit certain skills until you\u2019ve created the Persona that\u2019s right for you. Seeing HD versions of long-time enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for longtime fans. \u201c Enemy designs are varied and colorful, ranging from humanoids that could almost pass as party members to extravagant complicated monsters, and seeing HD versions of enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for those that have been following the franchise for 20 years. Personas themselves also feature a bit of voice acting, which adds a nice extra layer of polish to negotiation during battles. Exploiting enemies\u2019 elemental weaknesses is pretty standard fare (ice is weak to fire, etc.), and swapping between multiple Personas to keep up with the ever-changing vulnerabilities of foes you encounter helps keep combat from becoming too repetitive. The ability to swap between Personas allows you to choose the right element for any given occasion, which becomes important in battles against enemies who are invulnerable to all but one type of attack. As combat becomes more challenging and exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes imperative, smartly using the new Baton Pass ability can allow for devastating chains and exponential damage increases that completely turn the tide in battle. Baton Pass allows you to hand off your turn to another party member after earning an extra battle action by hitting an enemy\u2019s weak point. That gives you the opportunity to chain together multiple passes, adding a new element of strategy to combat. This is a game changer, as you not only have to make sure you have a Persona with the right element to take down an enemy, but also that you\u2019ve selected party members with skills that can keep the chain going. Persona Review Scores 14 Images Of course, like any good JRPG, Persona 5 needs a place to allow you to grind to higher levels by fighting enemies over and over. While you can\u2019t return to palaces once they\u2019re complete, you can continually return to a (singular) area called Mementos. Mementos is a large, separate dungeon that returns to the format of procedurally generated hallways like in previous Persona games, and new, deeper levels are unlocked as you beat more palaces. It\u2019s a welcome change of pace in that it provides straightforward battles with no puzzles in between, which is a nice break after working through a particularly challenging dungeon. Since you can\u2019t return to palaces, Mementos also serves as a great place to recruit Personas that you may have missed in previous dungeons. Personas you previously encountered will begin to turn up in new layers of Mementos after you\u2019ve beaten the palace where they originally appeared. Combined with the ability to fuse Personas into new combinations, this thankfully prevents any Personas from being truly missable. Missions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others. \u201c Mementos is also home to Persona 5\u2019s side missions, which involve triggering smaller-scale changes of heart in enemies like school bullies or clingy exes in order to receive bonus cash and items. These missions aren\u2019t much more than short vignettes and didn\u2019t really provide deep enough stories to make me care about the minor characters, in most cases. That said, a few stood out as particularly effective, such as a pet lover fighting against animal abuse or workers fed up with the exploitive practices of their boss. Missions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others. The most elaborate side missions are those that you earn through Confidants, which are party members or other characters who you\u2019ll form relationships with and level up over time. These Confidants will occasionally introduce you to additional tangential characters whose heart you\u2019re required to change in Mementos in order to continue progressing your relationship with that Confidant. These were generally great and helped to reveal a neat twist in the corresponding story, such as a sympathetic person actually being sinister or unexpected connections between characters. Social Climber Persona 5 is a solid modern turn-based JRPG first and foremost, but it also quickly becomes a captivating time-management simulator. When you\u2019re not saving the world, your time after school is your own. You\u2019re able to visit hub districts within Tokyo for activities like training at the gym, fishing, working a part-time job, batting practice, seeing a movie, or just heading home to study, play a retro game, or read one of dozens of books. These activities are a gigantic improvement upon the comparatively limited amount of things to do in Persona 4, and a fun way to expand your personal stats like Charm, Guts, or Kindness. On top of social activities, you also have 20 Confidants to spend time with, forging bonds with fellow students or other citizens of Tokyo. As you level up these bonds you\u2019ll earn relevant stat increases and gameplay advantages that are surprisingly robust. Spending time with a speech-giving politician, for example, might help your negotiation skills, while training with an arcade\u2019s light-gun expert helps your expertise in ranged weapons, and a local board game champion will give you new strategies in battle. Balancing Persona 5\u2019s many activities with maintaining these social links (each of which can only be advanced on specific days) is a welcome challenge and will require methodical notetaking for anyone who wants to maximize each day of the calendar. Persona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight. \u201c Confidants themselves are voiced and come in a wide range of ages, genders, and circumstances, with noteworthy stories for each. I found myself almost as interested in some Confidants\u2019 stories as I was in the main plot, which offers even more incentive for dedicating time to hanging out with those people. As in previous games, many of the Confidants can still advance into intimate relationships at their highest levels, though it was disappointing to see that Persona 5 still doesn\u2019t offer same-sex dating, despite plenty of sexual tension between the protagonist and a few of the male Confidants. By offering so many options and only a finite amount of free time, Persona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight. Choosing to work part-time might give you extra cash to buy better weapons, but it comes at the cost of ranking up a Confidant or increasing your stats. Spending time with a specific Confidant might help you learn a skill that fits your play style, but it means sacrificing learning more about a different character whose story you might be more interested in. Maximizing the skill you\u2019ve been grinding away at or finishing a side story after multiple in-game months of watching it progress are tremendously rewarding experiences, and even lamenting the opportunities you missed adds a unique layer of replayability that makes starting a New Game+ all the more enticing. Tokyo Jungle Aside from the dozens of activities available, the very act of exploring Persona 5\u2019s Tokyo is a delight. From city lights at night to crowded subways during your school commute, every part of this world is bursting with vibrant color, and every detail feels meticulously thought out and eerily accurate to real-world Tokyo. The anime-like art style is complemented by full animated cutscenes that are absolutely gorgeous and help to punctuate major story events. Each area of Tokyo feels completely distinct, with the major hubs of Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Akihabara each offering aesthetic differences on top of locations reminiscent of their actual real-life counterparts. Shinjuku features a seedy dive bar in contrast to Shibuya\u2019s family-friendly diner, and Akihabara is home to an arcade and shops for buying games and electronics. As the subway-themed map begins to fill in, you get a sense of just how much there is to do in Tokyo compared to Persona 3 and 4\u2019s relatively tiny Tatsumi Port Island and Inaba. The very act of exploring Persona 5\u2019s Tokyo is a delight. \u201c All of this is further enhanced by Persona 5\u2019s impressive sense of style. I found myself flicking back and forth in menus over and over simply to appreciate the slick transitions. Sharp design choices permeate even tiny details of gameplay, like scene changes that vary based upon your mode of transportation as you leave each area, or a free-flowing results screen after victory in battle. It almost feels strange to highlight since the incredible style is immediately apparent after looking at it for even a few seconds, but I can\u2019t overstate the number of times that I marveled at the gorgeous effects like ambushing an enemy and flowing directly into battle, or went out of my way to explore on a rainy day to appreciate weather effects or small touches like pulling out an umbrella as you leave a building. Persona 5\u2019s dynamic acid jazz-inspired soundtrack also helps to highlight everything from quiet moments to bombastic boss battles, helping to tie together an overall experience that feels truly special."

Though it may look primitive at a glance, your options in this virtual sandbox world are limited only by your imagination.  Cobbling together a first home out of dirt and stone feels great; building a castle with a moat, a dining hall, and a working underground rail system feels even greater. That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of exploring underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, tense, and one of gaming\u2019s most expressive creative outlets.   Minecraft\u2019s randomly generated worlds are composed of these big blocky cubes of dirt, stone, sand, and dozens of other materials. The blocks are colorful, distinct, and memorable thanks to simple but charming textures. What makes them great is how they enable creativity. Piece by piece you\u2019ll rearrange and refine the pristine, primordial world into whatever you want. It could be a mountainside home, a huge tree house, a skyscraper, or any other creation you can envision. This is a power we rarely see in games, and the freedom it offers is, at first, daunting.  In Survival mode, each block must be chipped at and collected by hand from an open world. What initially feels like a tedious task becomes the basis for Minecraft\u2019s rewarding core gameplay. I had to gather, transport, and place each piece of my home myself, so it was impossible not to feel a fierce sense of pride and ownership over it and all my other creations, big and small.  Land Grab  When the sun goes down, Minecraft\u2019s bad guys come for you. They are scary and dangerous\u2026 for maybe an hour. Once you obtain the simple items needed to ward them off, they become almost completely non-threatening. This feels immediately disappointing. Why have enemies at all if they become laughable in no time?  But later, as my ambitions for building outgrew my resources on hand, my quest for new materials drove me deeper underground. Down there I realized those same enemies that are easy to defeat on the surface felt far more challenging to fight in the confines of a rocky corridor where they could ambush me. The amount of danger I was in was tied to how far from my base I roamed.  Losing everything I carried to a Creeper who got the drop on me was a heartbreaking lesson, but the excitement of exploring new places and the risk it entails provided a constant tension. All the while, gathering new blocks and items sent my mind reeling with more ideas for landscaping and home decoration.   Those goals don\u2019t change when you bring friends in, but whether you\u2019re cooperating or trying to outdo each other with larger, grander creations, having other people there makes Minecraft more rewarding. The PS4 and Xbox One versions of Minecraft allow two- to four-player split-screen play, and there\u2019s an online mode that accommodates up to eight. Joining other people\u2019s worlds is easy, too, thanks to a simple, easy-to-use lobby.  Unlike in the sometimes-cramped PS3 and 360 versions, the improved power of the new-generation consoles can handle vast worlds. They're 36 times larger, in fact, and there's plenty of room to spread out and build, even in a full eight-player game.  Learn a Craft  If you thought Minecraft was just about stacking blocks, the tutorial will wipe away that perception quickly. The quick and comprehensive introduction fully explains the basics of gathering, building, and crafting, and different stations around the tutorial world teach you how to enchant items, brew potions, start a garden, set up working electrical circuits, ride a boat, build golems, and more.  There\u2019s a huge number of activities going on here.  The crafting interface conveniently includes recipes for every item, and it highlights the items you don\u2019t yet have in your inventory. With dozens and dozens of combinations available, the built-in recipes keeps you playing rather than hunting through wiki guides and memorizing recipes.   Minecraft\u2019s many items and systems are too numerous to list in entirety, but a few stand out. As you kill things and mine certain materials, you\u2019ll earn experience orbs which can be spent on enchantments. It makes mining and fighting things faster, easier, and more fun. The same can be said for potions, which heal you, grant resistance to fire, and more. Light RPG elements like these add depth to Minecraft without bloating the interface with skill trees or stat screens.  Don't Suffer For Your Art  Under all that adventuring is Minecraft\u2019s brilliant builder toy. Creative Mode basically enables all the cheat codes and lets you play with it freely, turning off monster damage, letting you fly, and giving you endless supplies of all the materials to build to your heart\u2019s content. Without having to work and fight for them, my creations in this mode felt a little hollow. Still, Creative Mode is as much fun as a bottomless tub of LEGOs, and between the fun of flexing my own imagination and checking out the amazing projects other people have constructed, it\u2019s full of possibilities."

        "Content": "The American West has made actors famous and writers rich. It has inspired children on the playground and grizzled country singers alike. Its stories of heroes and bandits, gold rushes and simple homesteaders have been fictionalized and romanticized to the point that they're known the world over. And yet, video game makers have either ignored the setting or attempted to squeeze it into existing game conventions with limited success. That has all changed now that Rockstar, the group made famous for its Grand Theft Auto series, turned its eye towards the Wild West. No game maker has approached the period with as much passion and power as Red Dead Redemption . This is the new bar that all Westerns must strive to reach.  Check out our full video: Why We Love Red Dead Redemption. It's tempting to say that Red Dead Redemption is ahead of its time, but the reality is that this is a game of and for the times. Rockstar shows an uncanny ability to hold a mirror up to society and remind us that present day hot button issues like racism, immigration, federal government power and personal freedoms are not only nothing new, they are deeply ingrained in American society. They are forces that helped to shape America into what it is, and their inclusion in Red Dead Redemption gives it a sense of authenticity that videogames in general lack. But rather than preaching politics at you, Red Dead Redemption puts you in the shoes of the relatively neutral John Marston. This former outlaw gone straight has found that history has a way of catching up with you. Those who were once his friends have now become enemies, leaving Marston alone and fighting for his future in a lawless land. It's a setup that is almost cliche, but this is only the beginning of your adventure. The storyline of Red Dead Redemption will take you all over a vast swath of countryside that straddles the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Along the way you'll meet, assist, and spill blood with a fantastic cast of supporting characters as Marston attempts to set things straight. The characters are wonderful with top notch dialogue and voice acting -- all good enough to make you feel a part of the world. If there is any criticism I could level at the story, it's that Marston occasionally feels divorced from the action, his motivations muddled as he is all too willing to help anybody that asks for it despite his own pressing matters. A simple, \"I'm being made to do this,\" from Marston is all you'll get out of the protagonist for much of the game while secondary characters drive the tale along, which was a bit of a disappointment for me. This all changes towards the end, however, as Red Dead Redemption builds towards a shattering climax that is amongst the best I've ever seen in a video game. Following that main story will take you roughly 20 hours from start to finish, though most will find that there is so much to do that it is difficult to focus on one thing. This is made by Rockstar, after all, and their heritage as masters of the open world sandbox game is not lost. Herding cattle and breaking mustangs? Check. Tracking down outlaws for bounty? You can take them dead or alive. Treasure hunting and sharpshooting challenges? There are dozens of them. The side missions and quests range from the little things like playing horse shoes or poker to big shootouts at bandit hideouts. There are even some that are fleshed out enough to be a part of the main storyline. You could spend hours just riding around trying to track down all of the components of a new outfit for Marston, or hunting wild game and picking herbs and desert flowers. The Rockstar Social Club, a free online community that connects to the game, offers additional challenges and leaderboards to encourage even more replay. If you're looking for one game to occupy you for months, this is it.  As you begin to make a name for yourself, the world of Red Dead Redemption adapts to your fame. The question of ethics and morality is left up to the player. If you want to be a salty drunk that assaults women and robs stagecoaches , that's your prerogative. Others might prefer to help the needy and be more honorable . Though there is a legal system in Red Dead Redemption that will keep the most villainous in check, you're free to take the high or low road in most any situation. A little morality meter, alongside a separate fame bar tracks your actions and the citizens you come across will begin to react to your renown. It's a system that allows for a huge amount of freedom and then rewards you for exploring it. Like many Rockstar games, that freedom may ruffle a few feathers. Several of the actions you're able to perform will surely be considered indecent by some. But all of that is left up to the player, and as it turns out there isn't just a lot to do -- there's a lot to see . The world feels alive with something happening everywhere you turn. Birds come screaming out of the bushes as your horse thunders by. Trains whistle while storms come blowing in to fill low-lying areas with fresh puddles. Around the next bend might be a carriage being robbed by bandits, its poor inhabitants crying out for help, or there might be a cougar or bear ready to tear down your horse and bring Marston to his knees. Walk through town and you might see a drunk assaulting a prostitute, a lynch mob dragging a poor soul through the main drag, or a person who caught wind of your fame and has come looking for a duel. The simulation -- though its aggressive nature occasionally creates a goofy backdrop to Marston's conversations -- is always presenting something new and exciting.  Welcome to the Wild West.  What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie. Red Dead Redemption is a gorgeous game with an incredible attention to detail. The art direction, particularly the careful consideration paid to the color palette and geology of the land, is superb. Exactly the right amount of red is used to make the dusty hills and plateaus come to life, the sunsets look breathtaking, and the purple mountains call out with the majesty they're known for. The area you can explore is immense and dotted with towns, ruins, and different environments that all feel hand crafted and unique. Just ride out towards the sunset and listen to the exceptional soundtrack and you'll feel teleported to a whole new world. The setting of Red Dead Redemption, leaving out the interactive elements, is an achievement in itself. Add in the smooth way the world reacts and moves and you have a game that is stunning. Horses gallop realistically. Bodies dangling from those horses -- be it from a rope or from a foot caught in a stirrup -- animate near perfectly. Shoot a bandit in the hat and it will fly off, or aim for the legs and he'll stumble to the ground while you prepare to hogtie him. None of the animations are canned, which means every time you go out into the desert to play you'll have a slightly different and awesome outcome.  It's a gorgeous game.  The only slight detractor from this wonderful world is that Red Dead Redemption doesn't have quite the same level of polish as we've come to expect out of a Rockstar game. While playing I noticed the occasional bug (once during a cutscene the game rendered two of the same character doing different animations, creating a weird ghosting effect) and the game did freeze during loading a couple of times. The game's graphics engine can't always keep up with the action, either, resulting in some visual hiccups here or there. Given the scope of what has been accomplished here, Red Dead Redemption is actually a relatively smooth experience, but it isn't perfect. The developer's pedigree must also be mentioned when talking about the game itself. Some will describe Red Dead Redemption as Grand Theft Auto in the Wild West and in some ways that description is accurate. Many of the same presentational elements created in the GTA universe are used here, included extended conversations during rides to the next mission and the layout of the mini-map. In that regard, GTA veterans will feel right at home, though they will find little improvements to the formula in things like better checkpoint and mission replay systems.  This isn't just a redo of Grand Theft Auto with a different backdrop, however. Rockstar did a remarkable job of taking only the elements of its past games that work while adapting the flow and the controls to the Western setting. The Dead Eye slow motion effect makes you feel like a classic gunslinger. The confluence of a wide-open setting and turn of the century technology offer the perfect mix of civilization and wilderness. And the greater emphasis on ambient missions and random encounters makes the West feel as wild and untamed as your childhood daydreams imagined it. Red Dead Redemption handles well, too, outside of touchy horse controls that make the mounts seem a little too eager to jump over a fence or into a river. The target assist makes attacking enemies while riding a horse a breeze, but it also makes the combat a little too easy at times. The cover system works similarly to GTA IV, but there just didn't seem much need for it when I could simply walk ahead slowly ripping off shots with perfect accuracy. I died here or there, but rarely did Red Dead Redemption feel particularly challenging. Even after you've beaten Red Dead Redemption and completed 100% of the side challenges, there's still much more to do. The game continues online with cooperative and competitive modes for up to 16 players simultaneously. The competitive action includes team and free-for-all game types including standard shootouts and a capture the flag style of game. These are a decent distraction and can be quite fun -- especially at the start when each game begins with every player standing in a circle ready to draw pistols. Any hardcore player might end up a bit annoyed by the respawn system, however, which has a tendency to start you right next to an opponent. Without the other trimmings that I'll get to in a second, it isn't the kind of multiplayer experience I'd make a steady part of my gaming rotation.  Be as bad as you want to be.  The reason to keep coming back to Red Dead Redemption for months and months is called Free Roam. This is the multiplayer lobby of sorts, but the concept has been cranked up a notch to be an entire game in itself. Free Roam lets up to 16 players join into one world and then explore the entirety of the single-player map. You can form posses and take part in little skirmishes, simply shoot each other in the face, assault bandit hideouts and forts as a team, or just ride across the countryside together while taking part in hunting and gathering challenges. A large number of the side distractions from the single-player game are here, as well as a whole extra set of little objectives. By completing the missions, killing each other, or playing in competitive games, you can gain experience and begin leveling up to unlock new character models, modes, and better mounts to ride. Free Roam by itself is meaty enough to be an entirely separate game and it would still be awesome.  Sometimes you eat the bear...  Several special cooperative missions are being made for download as well, but they were not available at the time of this review and so they weren't considered. The first pack has been announced as free , though, so keep an eye out for it."

        "Content": "Forza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn\u2019t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What\u2019s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards. Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal. All of this is on top of what\u2019s essentially the traditional Horizon experience: dozens, and dozens, and dozens of races and activities spread across a host of disciplines. Racing, rally, drift, drag, editing your own events with Horizon Blueprint: the lot. With this many cars, this much customisation, and a never-ending stream of things to do, it seems Forza Horizon 4 wants to prove being here for a good time AND a long time aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Midlands Madness This is all largely made possible by Horizon 4\u2019s new default nature as an online, shared-world racer where all the other non-traffic cars cruising the open world are human players. We still race against AI \u2013 unless you elect to race with or against friends and such \u2013 but you\u2019ll be sharing the open world itself with the rest of us, doing our own thing. It\u2019s not unlike a more intimate version of The Crew, though the difference is it\u2019s not compulsory. You can play entirely offline if you want, and being knocked offline for any reason isn\u2019t an issue, either, because it\u2019s smart enough to seamlessly transition between its offline and online state in the background while you continue playing. It happened to me a couple of times and there was no loss of progress at all. You can play entirely offline if you want, and being knocked offline for any reason isn\u2019t an issue. \u201c Even as an antisocial grouch when it comes to multiplayer, I honestly found no good reason to remove myself from the online environment. Pausing, rewinding; that all still works, even online. And strangers are ghosted on contact, too \u2013 during both free roaming and Forzathon Live events \u2013 so no one can interrupt your cruising or stunt driving unless you link up and join a convoy with them, at which point collisions are in effect. It\u2019s worthwhile to participate, too, because the points picked up from completing Forzathon challenges form a second in-game currency, separate from the regular credits earned racing. These \u2018Forzathon points\u2019 can be redeemed at a separate shop for rare cars and other vanity items, including emotes that seem to range from \u2018memes from when Vine was still a thing\u2019 to \u2018yep, that\u2019s that dance my kid does forty times a day.\u2019 It\u2019s a bit like the mileage exchange in GT Sport. It seems most of this stuff can also be won randomly as you level up and, while I\u2019m not a big fan of slot-machine style prizes, it should be noted there are no microtransactions involved and no performance upgrades are gated behind it. Whether the piles of emotes, avatar clothing options, and novelty horns grab your fancy will be a matter of personal preference. As someone who\u2019ll happily wear the same jeans and hoodie for a decade I\u2019m a little numb to fashion, personally, but the GTA Online-style victory dances are pretty cute. A Crazy Shade of Winter There\u2019s a glimpse of all four seasons during the four- to five-hour introduction phase, but once the prologue\u2019s first \u201cyear\u201d is over seasons will rotate weekly (online or offline). It\u2019s been Autumn throughout the bulk of this review and it might just be my favourite season. There just seems to be so much detail, from the spectrum of colours in the trees as their leaves die off at different rates, to the soggy roadside puddles that persist in an environment that\u2019s becoming too cool for them to evaporate. Winter is excellent, too. If you\u2019ve played Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain, you\u2019ll have a basic idea of what to expect. It\u2019s not just the world turned white; the landscape takes on an entirely new identity. Every IGN Forza Game Review Ever 17 Images I can\u2019t quite vouch for the more granular details of the environment that Playground Games nailed so well in Forza Horizon 3 because I don\u2019t live in Britain, but overall Horizon 4\u2019s Britain is just dazzling. It\u2019s a place filled with quaint little towns, quiet farms, and snaking country roads lined with hedges and crumbling stone walls. Babbling brooks, dense forests, a wide beach, rocky mountaintops, castles, and other centuries-old structures are scattered all across the map. There also more life to it, with deer, rabbits, chickens, and some amazingly agile sheep in residence. The star of the map is Edinburgh, which is much prettier than Horizon 3\u2019s Surfers Paradise. \u201c It\u2019s gorgeous and I\u2019ve enjoyed exploring it immensely. On Xbox One X I\u2019ve opted to stick with the game\u2019s default \u201cQuality\u201d mode (native 4K, HDR, 30 frames per second) because I\u2019ve been content with playing Horizon games locked at 30 fps in the past, but there is also a \u201cPerformance\u201d mode (which cranks up the framerate to 60 and sets the resolution at 1080p, also with HDR). Dawn and dusk in particular are incredible showcases for Horizon 4\u2019s lighting, and it\u2019s these times of day I most enjoy for some more gentle cruising. The overt distinctions between zones aren\u2019t as stark as they are in Horizon 3\u2019s Australia, which shifts from extremes like dry orange desert to dank rainforest, but a massive increase in elevation differences makes up for that. Having Horizon 4\u2019s roads wind over so many hills results in more interesting driving. There\u2019s also a wider difference between road types, which range from wide, modern motorways to narrow alleys and quirky junctions that could\u2019ve been designed hundreds of years before the invention of internal combustion. The star of the map, however, is Edinburgh, which is much prettier than Horizon 3\u2019s Surfers Paradise. Edinburgh in Horizon 4 is a beautiful place, oozing with history and boasting a really interesting road layout. It\u2019s probably my favourite place to joyride. Petrolhead Paradise The supporting cast of cars is the biggest it\u2019s ever been in the series, and also the most eclectic, with rides ranging from the 59-kilogram Peel P50 microcar to the ludicrously large Unimog, which is fun but so big it can actually cause the chase camera a spot of grief sometimes when passing under structures. As a car nerd I particularly enjoyed how exceedingly British the barn finds have been, representing a really respectful and well-rounded cross section of British car culture. Mitsubishi seem to have joined Toyota/Lexus in backing out of the Horizon series (for now, at least) but there are 450 cars from more than 100 other manufacturers in Horizon 4, so there are plenty of other options. Cars with special body kit options and other unique accessories are again sorted into their own tab for those keen to acquire vehicles with the most customisation options. Forza Motorsport 7\u2019s new drift suspension and tuning options are present in Horizon 4, and drag tyres have also made their way across. There\u2019s even a new track width option available for certain cars, which I\u2019ve tried on a few older vehicles. Spacing the rears out on my A9X Torana certainly helps it look a lot more racey, rather than having the tyres under the wheel arches. Vulcan versus Vulcan (or, at least, something that looks a lot like one). Showcases are back and they\u2019re some of the very best of the series so far. The Halo one will win hearts but I especially love the contest against the delta wing bomber, which is huge, fast, and looks breathtaking soaring so close to the ground. Bucket List challenges are gone, though they\u2019ve been replaced by Horizon Stories, which are essentially the same events wrapped in a different context. One thread lets us loose as a movie stunt driver, while another sets us up with a YouTuber counting down her favourite racing games. This story, which overtly pays homage to the likes of Ridge Racer, Test Drive, Smuggler\u2019s Run, and many more, is a pretty classy and unexpected in-game nod to some of the great racers that have ultimately inspired the Forza Horizon series. I do miss the old Bucket List style a little, though, as I did like running into random cars around the world (and also completing friends\u2019 custom challenges). Horizon Blueprint is back, however, and you can create races in any season or time of day. This is a great way to dabble in seasons that may be several weeks away from occurring in the main game itself. You can also access Blueprint from the pause menu and play custom races on demand. Blueprint doesn\u2019t feature a route creator yet but one is apparently on the way. Groove Music support is tragically gone following the death of the service, taking Horizon 3\u2019s wonderful in-game OneDrive music support with it. The standalone app still works but it\u2019s not quite the same. That\u2019s the only terrible news in terms of audio, though, because the team have outdone themselves yet again. It\u2019s all tremendous stuff, from the very subtle call of a crow in a quiet winter paddock to the monstrous anti-lag of an Escort Cosworth, which sounds like Satan choking on a popcorn maker."

Here\u2019s what we said then:  Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur\u2019s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it. Few other RPGs allow such a wide range of flexibility while also supporting rewarding combat and a powerful story. This will be remembered as one of the greats. - Leif Johnson Now, the Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition refines and retools some elements of the first game that didn\u2019t quite stick, as a free update for owners of the original on PC, and ushers that excellent isometric experience onto consoles for the first time. And that translation to console is skillfully executed, delivering one of the greatest RPGs in recent memory with near-lossless quality. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the most beautiful looking isometric RPGs and that hasn\u2019t changed. \u201c Technically, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the most beautiful looking isometric RPGs and that hasn\u2019t changed. Quality does depend on the power of your box though, with visuals popping on both the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro \u2013 especially in HDR. While the standard Xbox One and PS4 are no slouches either, there are noticeable dips in framerate in graphically intensive areas, and all consoles infrequently jerk when the big fireworks go off mid-battle. But all things considered, the Xbox One X is consistently the shiniest, best performing console version. Of the number of positive changes introduced in the Definitive Edition by developer Larian Studios, most will likely go unnoticed unless you\u2019ve invested dozens of hours into the original. Things like fleshed out character stories and interactions, a no-pressure story mode, reworked and brand new fights, character pacing, a new comprehensive arena mode and more round out this Definitive Edition, and I\u2019m most excited to see the largely rewritten third act when I finally get back to it.   Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch Released: September 5, 2019 When I originally reviewed the Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition \u2013 this review that you\u2019re reading now \u2013 I was shocked at how smoothly and seamlessly Larian Studios was able to translate a hardcore PC roleplaying game like Divinity 2 to consoles. It shouldn\u2019t work. There are too many options, skills, interactive objects, and mechanics that require the familiar cascading dropdown menus and precision of a mouse to make work. But, lo and behold, the Definitive Edition on a console is as lossless an experience as you could hope to see. That same spirit of \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t work but somehow it does\u201d is extended to the Nintendo Switch port of Divinity Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition. Somehow Larian has taken the massive scope and breadth of this 80- to 150-hour game and made it fit on the Nintendo Switch. And, though I should know better than to bet against Larian by now, I\u2019m surprised by just how close the Switch port is to its PC counterpart. Of course, the platform matters as much as the port, and while there are some issues inherent to running Divinity on the Switch, they\u2019re equally offset by the positives \u2013 namely you can play this mega-RPG on the go, which should bump up the completion rate considerably for those who can\u2019t spend 100 hours sitting at a PC. Like many games that ultimately come to the Switch, there\u2019s a noticeable hit to the resolution, though I didn\u2019t feel it was a big issue while playing in handheld mode unless I put my face right up against the screen \u2013 which you shouldn\u2019t get in the habit of anyway. It\u2019s a more glaring issue playing docked on a 1080p television \u2013 or worse, on a massive 4K display \u2013 but again, that\u2019s part of the inherent trade-off for the flexibility and portability of this port, and it doesn\u2019t look so much worse as to detract from a great game. Fortunately, the excellent controller layout and user interface Larian cooked up for the Definitive Edition are once again tapped for the Switch version, and I found it as reliable here as I did in the other console ports \u2013 though I think the already diminished precision of a gamepad is further exacerbated by the Switch\u2019s stubby thumbsticks. Ultimately, Divinity Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition on Switch is an effective alternative to its console cousins if you know what your trading for it. Sure, some of the character portraits and assets might look a bit fuzzy and the resolution on a big TV isn\u2019t going to win any awards, but you\u2019re free to migrate your saves from PC to your handheld and play one of the best RPGs in recent memory on a plane, a train, or in an automobile. And the fact that\u2019s even possible is incredible considering how huge, involved, and flexible a game like this is. Bottom line \u2013 Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch stands as an equal to the other versions available, and is deserving of the same score I awarded the original release. For more information on the core experience, you can check out our original Divinity: Original Sin 2 review .  Quality Control But the make-it-or-break-it element of the Definitive Edition on consoles is jamming an entire keyboard\u2019s-worth of features onto the limited buttons of a controller. Fortunately, Divinity: Original Sin 2 on a gamepad is impressively intuitive. Through a series of radial and drop-down menus you\u2019re only ever a few button presses away from doing whatever you want. While there are some few rough edges you don\u2019t find on the PC, I\u2019m still surprised by just how seamless traditionally complex mechanics like dividing your party, organizing your inventory, or managing your action bar perform on Larian\u2019s controller layout, with the area search feature for easy looting being my favorite consideration. However, as expected, cursor precision on the controller isn\u2019t as spot-on as with a mouse. Larian has included settings to cope \u2013 like a tactical camera and character highlights to help differentiate friend from foe \u2013 but I still occasionally found myself accidently attacking the ground or buffing an enemy instead of my character. But these one-off inconveniences are the exception to the rule \u2013 Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition works brilliantly on a gamepad. Fantasy Friend and Foe That intuitive translation extends to the two-player local, and four-player online cooperative modes as well. Locally, the screens seamlessly split and rejoin based on proximity, and swapping ownership of characters is a breeze. And though I spent over 100 hours playing Divinity 2\u2019s original release all by my lonesome, I can definitely see myself easily making the transition to re-discovering Divinity: Original Sin 2 with good friends in a cooperative setting. Finally, the new arena is what an armchair strategist like me has been wanting. Divinity Original Sin 2 has one of the best isometric-RPG tactical fighting systems, possibly ever, and it\u2019s a consistent joy to see what kind of explosive or sly strategies you can employ. The arena mode \u2013 supporting one-to-four teams of one-to-four characters \u2013 is an endless pool of that fun as you craft strategies from the 16 playable characters pulled from Divinity lore. Facing other players online or locally, or just testing my mettle against the AI in increasingly hopeless odds is something I still haven\u2019t grown tired of over a dozen matches later."

        "Content": "Stiff arming its way through the crowded battle royale genre, Fortnite Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that\u2019s unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can\u2019t be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you\u2019re skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a flying party bus \u2013 a nice change of pace from a drab military plane \u2013 and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm. Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite\u2019s map is at least small enough (relative to PUBG\u2019s) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border. On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures \u2014 a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items. Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite Save the World, still exists, but it\u2019s not great . But as the battle royale genre started to gain popularity early in 2017, Epic adapted its survival game\u2019s basic systems into something new: Fortnite Battle Royale, a separate, free-to-play game that feels like the perfect home for Save the World\u2019s wayward mechanics. Fortnite Battle Royale\u2019s inventory management is, thankfully, simple by design. You get just five slots, so you\u2019re forced to balance your arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with enemy structures. It\u2019s a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn\u2019t come up with the exact item you want, you\u2019ll never feel powerless in a fight. Once you do find the weapons you\u2019re looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it\u2019s far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of almost every fight in Fortnite. It\u2019s a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated. It\u2019s a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single well placed shot. It\u2019s a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic. It\u2019s the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building. Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about everything that isn\u2019t the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It\u2019s a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have created. But that\u2019s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple. That\u2019s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple. With just three primary tiles \u2013 floors, walls, and stairs \u2013 the building toolset may seem limited, but it\u2019s got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost anyone can pull it off \u2013 and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the island. The first time I really understood how Fortnite\u2019s building and shooting played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map\u2019s many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun \u2013 a weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent\u2019s wall, jumped off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting. While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious \u2013 like building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy\u2019s shots \u2013 the system also gives you room to think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can\u2019t help yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem \u2013 just make your own bridge to the other side. One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze. Thanks to the building system\u2019s simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way that suits your style. While some people love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep things at a lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and the ground. One player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze. Creative uses of building become even more apparent in the heat of battle. With every building decision made in a split second, every player develops their own unique techniques. Where one person might build a wall, another builds stairs they can use to rush forward. When I might create a window in the middle of my wall to take an extra shot, someone else might try to flank around the side of the building by adding a new section entirely. What might start as a simple staircase at the beginning of a small fight between me and another person could morph into a twisted modern art spire as more people join in and add their own pieces. Fortnite\u2019s building mechanic is an incredible system that allows for personal expression in a way that really isn\u2019t present in many other competitive games. While building is a freeform system, there\u2019s an invisible grid that exists around the entire island that helps every piece that you build snap into place, and it works almost flawlessly. Of the hundreds of structures I\u2019ve placed, it was rare that even one piece landed where I wasn\u2019t expecting, and I\u2019ve never gotten myself stuck or killed as a result. That\u2019s a pleasant surprise, considering how much building happens during chaotic firefights. All of this adds up to a system that is simply a joy to use. Everytime a fight broke out I\u2019d get a spark of excitement as I started to think about how I would fight and build my way out of the situation at the same time. Quickly doing the math to determine if I had enough resources to build a staircase for a daring rush toward my enemy adds an extra mental thrill to combat. Every new plan felt like I was learning more about Fortnite Battle Royale and the way it would let me play \u2013 even if most of them ended with a shotgun in the face, it\u2019s how that shotgun got to that face that mattered. Epic has shown a willingness to make big changes to the weapon hierarchy overnight. Even if you find something that works, you can\u2019t get complacent because part of the beauty of Fortnite Battle Royale is its constant state of upheaval. Epic has shown a willingness to make big changes to the weapon hierarchy overnight. Maybe in the next patch, snipers will replace shotguns as the go-to weapon class and the simple staircases and bridges of today will give way to the grandiose sniping fortresses of tomorrow as building tactics change to match the new weapon balance. That\u2019s how Fortnite Battle Royale has overcome one of the biggest challenges for any battle royale game: Keeping up with the demand from its community for new and exciting gameplay and cosmetic additions. The pace of new content has also been impressive. Since Fortnite Battle Royale\u2019s earliest release in July of 2017 Epic has made countless additions, from new towns and cities on the map to brand-new game modes, like the massive 50-vs-50 team mode from earlier this year or a recent patch\u2019s Blitz mode, which has already become a fan favorite thanks to its speeder resource gathering and higher frequency of loot spawns. The biggest microtransaction available is the $10 Battle Pass. Even Fortnite Battle Royale\u2019s free-to-play structure feels a step ahead of the competition. Every item offered in the in-game store is strictly cosmetic, like character skins and new pickax designs. There\u2019s a daily shop, where the selection of wares refreshes every 24 hours, and a legendary shop that updates every week or so with items that are likely to never return, like the particularly gaudy pink bear costume for Valentine\u2019s Day or the extremely detailed Wukong skin that was released as a part of Fortnite\u2019s Chinese New Year celebration. But the biggest microtransaction available in Fortnite Battle Royale is the Battle Pass, a one-time, $10 purchase that gives you access to 100 tiers of rewards that unlock as you play and complete unique challenges. It\u2019s a neat structure that keeps you constantly working toward the next big milestone. The influx of huge and constant gameplay changes may seem haphazard or dangerous when so many people already love it, running the risk of fixing what ain\u2019t broke. But so far, Epic\u2019s been smart enough about it to make people work to adjust their tactics while also avoiding the loss of the things that make Fortnite Battle Royale fun. The only downside to all of these interlocking mechanics is the initial learning curve. Though each mechanic is simple on its own, making sense of them all together is a bit of a challenge \u2013 especially when there isn\u2019t much of a tutorial to speak of. In fact, outside of a few pieces of text, Fortnite Battle Royale mostly leaves you with simple trial-and-error and watching YouTube videos until you\u2019re able to figure out what makes it tick. For most of us, that means the first dozen or so trips out of the Battle Bus are likely to be pretty painful (and often very short) experiences. But, if you stick with it, all the systems start to click. That\u2019s Fortnite Battle Royale\u2019s ultimate reward for the process of learning: An immense freedom that allows for a hundred solutions to tackle any problem, and none of them are just right or just wrong. This is the rare game where each loss fills me with more determination to improve than  disappointment, and each death comes with a quick realization of what went wrong and where. I\u2019m constantly left eager to queue up for another match and try to correct previous mistakes \u2014 it doesn\u2019t hurt that the time between dying and dropping out of the Battle Bus again never takes more than 60 seconds, thanks to Fortnite\u2019s speedy matchmaking and enormous pool of players. Fortnite Battle Royale runs fantastically on every platform I played it on. The first couple of matches are all about the pursuit of tasting the first victory, or Victory Royale, as Fortnite calls it. Achieving it and seeing the tepid fanfare that accompanies it, however, ends up feeling like a bit of a letdown. But the feat of beating 99 other players is the true victory, and personal satisfaction is more than enough to make up for the bland winner screen. Suddenly, every game I dropped into felt winnable, and my drive to keep improving grew even more intense. Whether it was my first win, my fifth, or my twenty-fifth, the sense of excitement from a well-played game never leaves. This was twice as true in duo or squad games, when the lackluster victory screen becomes merely a backdrop to the shouts of my friends as they boast about their incredible shots and recount their closest calls. For more: see the latest  Fortnite Updates It\u2019s also important to mention that Fortnite Battle Royale runs fantastically on every platform I played it on (iOS, PS4, Xbox One, and PC), never stuttering or dropping frames even in middle of tense fights. That\u2019s crucial for the speed of building that it demands, and a distinctive advantage over its chief rival in the battle royale genre, PUBG, which has more than its fair share of performance problems. That list of platforms includes mobile, which is highly impressive in that it\u2019s exactly the same game as its console counterparts \u2013 to the point where cross-play between PC, Xbox One, and mobile is possible. Even on a device that fits in your pocket, Fortnite Battle Royale still looks fantastic, even if it\u2019s running at a slightly lower resolution than it would on most other platforms. The only real difference is the controls, which, for a mobile game, aren\u2019t terrible. In fact, I could pull off almost all of the same movements I could on PC as on my phone \u2013 at about a quarter of the speed. Playing with other mobile users, and thereby operating with exactly the same speed disadvantage, really does feel like playing a slightly slower version of Fortnite Battle Royale. So, while aiming and building skills don\u2019t exactly translate on mobile devices, the iOS version is a great alternative for anyone who doesn\u2019t have access to the console or PC versions \u2013 or if you just want to play on the go."

        "Content": "There\u2019s something special about a game where you can choose to reroute power away from the vital life-support system to the weapons and coax one last shot out of your crippled, flaming wreck of a spaceship. It\u2019s the kind of desperate, so-crazy-it-just-might-work move James T. Kirk or Han Solo would attempt to reverse his fortunes and save his crew. And even though it doesn\u2019t always work \u2013 or perhaps because it doesn\u2019t always work, and sometimes everyone dies and you have to start again \u2013 it\u2019s those moments when it does that make FTL: Advanced Edition one of the most memorable and replayable games I\u2019ve ever played. FTL is a story generator more than it is a game of skill. After countless hours of the PC and iPad versions, I\u2019ve effectively mastered its amazing ship-to-ship and somewhat weaker hand-to-hand combat systems \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take too long, as it generously allow you to pause at any time and consider what to do and where to move your tiny crewmembers. (That makes it an excellent fit for the iPad\u2019s touch controls, too.) But because it involves so many random factors, from whether a missile hits its mark to if your crew can rescue a space station from giant spiders in a miniature text adventure, FTL is often cruel to the point where a few bad jumps can render a playthrough effectively unwinnable. That\u2019s the joy of it: you never get to feel safe.  Combat seems rudimentary at first, since both 2D pixel-art ships sit still on the screen trading blows, but its wide variety of offensive and defensive options give it surprising legs. The many ways in which multiple versions of blasters, beams, flak, missiles, ion blasts, teleported bombs, attack drones, boarding parties with six distinctly different races, and mind control interact with shields, cloaking devices, defensive drones, engine speed, medical bays and cloning facilities, reinforced doors, and more is endlessly interesting. Success in battle involves timing your most powerful shots to hit when their shields are weakest, which effectively creates some great \u201cFire on my command!\u201d moments. Important decisions are everywhere. Do you target their shields first and make them more vulnerable to your next attack, or try to knock out their weapons with the first volley and spare yourself the repair bill of having to take some hits? Do you concentrate on raw firepower, or throw in some ion weaponry to quickly disable enemy systems, drones that can attack or defend, or send over boarding parties and use mind control to turn the enemy crew against each other? Or try to power up your FTL drive and run? Whatever you decide, no plan survives contact with the enemy, and FTL does a great job of throwing unexpected and unlikely attacks at you to force you to pause and reconsider. The one spot that could use some work on the iPad\u2019s touch interface is the weapon panel. As the most frequently accessed part of the UI, it\u2019s almost always either covering up vital crew health information or constantly needing to be reopened to target new enemy systems. On PC, that\u2019s not an issue. As you\u2019re driven forward through the five-sector map of randomized navigation points by an unstoppable rising tide of Rebel ships, it forces still more decisions. While you never know exactly what\u2019s waiting for you at each point, I\u2019m always tempted to explore as much as I can and upgrade my ship as much as I can before I reach the extremely tough battle at the end. Sometimes that backfires, and I have to bite my nails as I desperately limp to the nearest repair shop, hoping there\u2019s not a heavily armed pirate waiting to exploit my moment of weakness. Every jump is just as likely to land you in a well-written miniature text adventure that often feature interesting moral choices. Should fool an alien into joining your crew by telling him you\u2019re a god? Or abduct docile aliens to sell on the black market? Those moral choices almost never have direct good/evil consequences, so there\u2019s no one judging your actions but yourself. Some of your options will change depending on your crew composition and equipment, like if you send your robotic Engi crewmember into a quarantine zone, and that keeps them fresh for replaying. Some even turn into quest chains that unlock new ships for your next playthrough.  Those ships can dramatically change the way you play. Playing as the armored Rock cruiser, for example, makes me less afraid to take a few hits, and more inclined to send over boarding parties while using flame weaponry to kill the crew (since Rock crewmen are immune to fire). The same goes for the ship augmentations, which can change your viable strategies by giving you nearly infinite drone parts or allow you to fire your weapons once without waiting for them to charge. The free Advanced Edition update (the only one available on iPad) added a new eighth race called the Lanius, which drain oxygen from any room they occupy, making them good for deterring boarding parties and for attacking drone ships. There are a ton of other additions as well, and even after dozens of hours I\u2019m still discovering new quests."

        "Content": "Some games are short but sweet, concluded after a single, glorious play session. Others require a few sleepless weeks of dedicated play to unlock all of their mysteries. Then there are the very few games that take on a whole digital life of their own \u2013 that become a part of the player\u2019s daily ritual for years to come, with more to gain and accomplish than you could ever truly quantify. Animal Crossing: New leaf is one of the latter. It\u2019s also one of the most charming, addictive games I\u2019ve ever played. There's a whole lot of \"new\" in New Leaf, but before I get to that, rest assured that the core mechanics that have kept gamers playing for years after the release of prior installments are as strong as ever. The main idea behind any Animal Crossing game is that players move into a new town and spend their days building up relationships with villagers, harvesting fruit, fishing, catching bugs, decorating their house, and tackling the almost innumerable other activities that comprise one\u2019s Animal Crossing life. It doesn\u2019t sound like a to-do list that would necessarily make for the most enthralling game, but that\u2019s exactly what it amounts to. There\u2019s something about the relaxing rhythm of each activity that keeps you coming back for more, bolstered by the subtle yet effective way the game incentivizes you to keep playing, keep collecting, and generally keep on keeping on. What sets New Leaf apart - and makes it a cut above the rest - is that the barriers laid down in past entries have largely been lifted, allowing for a sense of freedom, creation, and ownership like never before. As the acting Mayor (a first for the series), you\u2019re now able to decorate not just the inside of your house, but the outside too, as well as your whole village. From the very outset you have a hand in deciding the layout of your village and the placement of your house, and eventually it\u2019s all on you to decide the location of certain establishments (like The Roost and the Police Station), as well as to determine what decorations will grace your town and where they\u2019ll go. You can place a miniature Stonehenge by the beach, a Zen bell by the train station, some streetlamps by your favorite villager\u2019s house, or even surround your own place (which can be a castle, if you like) with fountains. The possibilities expand the more you play, as villagers keep making suggestions for possible Public Works projects to improve your town. You can even personalize specific pieces of furniture by taking them over to Cyrus at the resell shop, ensuring that your home and village will be quite distinct from anyone else\u2019s. Evolving your stomping ground in this way is irresistible, as over time you watch it grow from a simple collection of houses to something truly amazing and unique. Having this freedom to shape your village to reflect your personality like never before truly enriches the experience. It\u2019s always been easy to fall in love with your village in Animal Crossing games, but now it really feels like your village, like a place you helped build from nothing, somewhere you really have a personal stake in. You\u2019re not just a museum patron, you\u2019re the one who funded its growth and filled its halls with fossils, fish, and bugs. You\u2019re not just a club-goer, you\u2019re the one who spear-headed the campaign to bring the music venue to your village in the first place. It\u2019s a delightful improvement that makes the experience impossible to put down, as there\u2019s always another project you can help fund and  another thing you can do to set your village apart from the rest. The brilliant thing is that Nintendo found a way to expand upon the gameplay of past entries without compromising the simplicity and charm that made the series so beloved to begin with. This is the evolution of Animal Crossing, and it\u2019s an absolute wonder to behold. One of the most astounding things about New Leaf is how much there is to do. In just a few weeks I\u2019ve put in well over a hundred hours, and there\u2019s still so much I\u2019d like to accomplish. In addition to the familiar activities, new additions like diving and swimming allow you to explore and interact with your town in a whole new way. It\u2019s refreshing, and a whole lot of fun. Completing public works projects, customizing furniture, and visiting the variety of shops across the tracks will also take up their fair share of time, and Nintendo fans will be pleased to know that there\u2019s now a whole range of Big N items you can acquire to decorate your house with (so if you\u2019re interested in getting a Triforce or Metroid for your living room, be sure to buy those fortune cookies on sale in the Nook brothers\u2019 shop). Throw in new holidays, new characters (like Reese and Cyrus from the resell shop), new clothing options (pants!), new furniture and so on, and you\u2019re left with an experience that is fresh, yet familiar. Simple, yet refined. Then there\u2019s the multiplayer, which is far beyond anything the series has ever attempted previously. As expected you can visit your friends\u2019 houses either online or locally \u2013 dropping off gifts if you\u2019re a good friend or chopping down their trees and messing up their flowers if you\u2019re a big jerk. But that\u2019s just the start. You can also visit \u201cdream versions\u201d of other villages in the Dream Suite. This allows players to upload their town for friends and strangers alike to visit. The genius part is that nothing visitors do actually affects the person\u2019s real town since it\u2019s just a dream. So you can go crazy stomping flowers and pissing off neighbors without paying the consequence of never being invited over again. Getting to be so bad without any negative repercussions is cathartic to say the least, and is a great way to encourage you to open your village to outsiders without the risk of a rude visitor ruining your town (and your day). For players who crave a more corporeal form of interaction, you can also engage in a series of delightful mini-games with players across the globe on Resort Island, headed up by the former Animal Crossing mayor, Tortimer. The island\u2019s perpetual summer is rather relaxing, and provides a great opportunity to stock up on seasonal fruit, beetles, and sharks for the selling. It\u2019s also convenient that you are fully able to enjoy the island and its diversions all by yourself if, for whatever reason, you don\u2019t feel like going online. Finally, StreetPass has been utilized to allow you to view the houses of anyone you pass who has a copy of the game. It\u2019s really cool getting to see everyone\u2019s different decorating styles, as well as being able to purchase the items that catch your eye. In a way, it creates the illusion of a persistent game world for you and your StreetPass friends, which is a nice touch. While the customization, variety, and multiplayer are certainly the highlights, pretty much everything in New Leaf has been refined to make this as delightful an experience as possible. The simple graphics have been touched up so that fuzzy animals are now actually fuzzy and larger animals tower over the smaller ones. Little things like being able to group fruit together in your inventory so you can carry more, donate multiple fossils at the same time, or tell which flowers you\u2019ve watered thanks to a new sparkling effect go a long way towards making the small chores that pack your day-to-day life easier than ever. These might seem like small details barely worth noting, but anyone who has ever played Animal Crossing will likely agree that, much like in life, it's all in the details."

It fulfills the promise of its predecessor while continuing to push the boundaries of what we should expect in a videogame. This is the continued saga of Commander Shepard. It's the future, and all sentient life across the galaxy is in peril. An advanced race of machines known as Reapers is intent on wiping the slate clean. Shepard, a distinguished soldier, has faced this threat and emerged triumphant once, but victory is far from assured. Now Shepard must take the fight to the enemy -- a mission that is dubbed suicidal from the outset. Things don't look very promising, but Shepard has a plan. It involves recruiting the best and brightest from around the galaxy and somehow convincing them their lives are worth sacrificing for the greater good.  Watch the video review. These heroes are what drive the story. Their motivations become yours as the experience continues to get better with each addition to the cast. Shepard's compatriots are fascinating and flawed; captivating and occasionally despicable. The arc of the main tale itself isn't in itself exceptional, but the characters BioWare has crafted most definitely are. These are some of the most compelling players I've ever seen in a videogame -- the Drell named Thane is a particular favorite of mine -- and the great design and writing isn't limited to the main cast. The citizens of the galaxy are extraordinary and offer more than enough reason to explore every location and talk to everybody. Collector's Edition EA and BioWare didn't stray too far from the beaten path when deciding what to include in the Collector's Edition for Mass Effect 2. At just a $10 USD premium over the standard edition, you shouldn't be expecting anything extraordinary here. If you go in with modest expectations, however, you will find a deluxe edition that contains quite a few collectible goodies. Here's a full list of what you get: Full standard edition of Mass Effect 2. 48 page hardcover mini-art book. Mass Effect Redemption #1 comic book. In-game special weapon and armor set. Making-of DVD. The package also contains a Cerberus Network activation code, as do all new copies of Mass Effect 2, which grants the owner access to a few bits of free downloadable content. So how does it all stack up? The package contains a few hits and a few misses. The special armor set includes a helmet that makes it so you can't see Shepard's face, even during cutscenes and conversations, which makes it a bit disappointing. The comic book does a good job of explaining why exactly Liara is behaving the way she is in Mass Effect 2, but you can also get a digital copy on iTunes if you'd like. The big items that fans will appreciate the most are the Making-of DVD and the art book. Since the box isn't any taller than a traditional DVD box, the art-book is relatively small. Still, fans will appreciate the high-quality concept art. The Collector's Edition DVD contains a few standard-definition behind-the-scenes videos, some trailers that you can probably find in 10 seconds on the Internet, and some nifty wallpapers that you can access by tossing the DVD into your home PC. Perhaps the nicest part of the package is the package itself. The discs come in a shiny metal case that looks quite slick. And the cover art on the Collector's Edition is far better than the standard edition box art. All told, this isn't the greatest Collector's Edition ever created, but it certainly isn't the worst. Fans with tempered expectations will find a satisfying package.  All of this is made even better by Mass Effect's trademark cinematic and interactive approach to conversations. With Mass Effect 1, BioWare introduced a conversation wheel that allowed for fast-moving, intriguing, and player driven cutscenes. Rather than slowly moving through conversations by selecting dialogue from a list, Mass Effect allows the player to quickly choose an emotional response, which generally include an honorable paragon reaction and a snappy renegade remark. The result is that every little dialogue snippet is about as engaging as they come. It was innovative when Mass Effect 1 first came out, and it's still so far ahead of the curve, backed up by further refinements, including a quick-time interrupt system,  and powerful voice acting. Mordin Solus, a Salarian scientist played by Michael Beattie, and Martin Sheen as the Illusive Man, are high points in an all-star cast of voices.  Watch our video roundtable for other opinions. The true strength of Mass Effect 2's story, however, is in how personal BioWare has made it. If you played Mass Effect 1 through to the end and still have your save data, this game will import your character and all the decisions you made. The central plot will not drastically change, but the experience most certainly will. Some old friends and acquaintances will return \u2013 and others won't \u2013 based on decisions you made in the last game. Even the opening moments of Mass Effect 2 can be slightly different. The actions you take in the sequel only compound this feeling of personalization. By the finale you'll have made so many decisions \u2013 ranging from simple things like whether you play as a male or female all the way up to those governing life or death \u2013 that the result is a game that is yours and yours alone. Choices you made in Mass Effect 1 come back to remind you of past good deeds or injustices. Decisions made here affect the final outcome. Reminders that everything you do will be reflected in Mass Effect 3 are everywhere, adding further drama to every conversation. Things you say and do actually matter, and that's an incredible sensation to get from a videogame. Starting New?  Whether you're new to Mass Effect or simply don't like the look of your Shepard, Mass Effect 2 gives you the opportunity to start anew. Those imported saves can change how Shepard looks. You can even pick a new character class. And everybody will start from level one.  Even if you didn't play Mass Effect 1, this game is worth playing. If you're not importing a character, BioWare simply makes some of the decisions from Mass Effect 1 for you. It's slightly less dramatic and the story here is often references events in the first game, which might make some bits less thrilling for novices. There are revelations and tantalizing plot twists that Mass Effect veterans will go crazy for. These same moments simply won't carry the same weight with those hopping in for part two. It's a bit of a Catch-22 for the designers tasked with the impossible job of pleasing newcomers while still pushing the limits. Speaking of pleasing people, BioWare listened to every last bit of criticism leveled at Mass Effect 1. That game, particularly on Xbox 360, suffered from a few technical and presentational issues. This sequel is a much, much cleaner experience. Long elevator rides and slow-loading textures are gone, replaced with (occasionally lengthy) loading screens. Generic cut-and-paste side quests and empty planets to explore have been totally ripped out. Pretty much everything that anybody took even the slightest issue with in Mass Effect 1 has been axed or rebuilt entirely.. Even though it's a cleaner production, Mass Effect 2 isn't a perfectly polished game. I've played through the game twice and during that time experienced sound cutting out, my character getting stuck in the environment and full game crashes. Thankfully, these miscues are infrequent, which allows the art style to shine. Mass Effect 2 is a visual treat, filled with breathtaking landscapes and an awesome attention to detail. If you're playing on PC and have a powerful rig (I took Shepard for a spin on an Alienware Intel Core 2 Quad 2.00 GHz prcoessor, dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260M cards, and 6 GB of memory), it will look even better.  The improvements aren't only technical. The inventory and skill systems have been made more manageable, streamlined to the point that they might initially appear too thin for a role-playing game. Keep playing, however, and you'll begin to see strength and depth emerge as you further customize your squad.  Thane is one of my favorite characters in any game. One of the biggest reasons why this streamlined approach to character customization works is the retooled character classes. The same six specialization options are back, ranging from the Jedi-inspired biotic users to the technically inclined engineer. This time, however, they've been defined and differentiated much more clearly, each getting its own set of weapon specializations and unique skills. Playing as a soldier is a vastly different combat experience compared to the vanguard or infiltrator. Each class has its own approach to battle, which is then further defined by how you choose to outfit your squad and where you assign skill points. By the end of the game, everything about Mass Effect 2 will be shaped by your choices \u2013 from the story to the ebb and flow of combat.

Good news. Mass Effect 2 is a lot of fun. The action has been refined to the point that even general fans of shooters will find a lot to like here. It's not perfect , but the game handles quite well. It doesn't take long to master simultaneously ripping off rounds from an assault rifle, tossing out a few biotic skills, and directing the two AI driven squad mates to combine raw power with smart tactics.

Mass Effect 1 toed the line by offering some of the action elements that shooter fans enjoy with some of the role-playing tactics that the hardcore fans of the genre want. The sequel improves both areas for a through-and-through satisfying battle system. On PC, the heads-up display is a bit different, custom built to work with a keyboard and mouse. Both versions are largely identical, though you will get a few more options for customizing hot keys and skill usage on the PC. Which works better for you will be a matter of personal preference. An emphasis has clearly been put on ensuring that the combat in Mass Effect 2 never grows stale. Side quests each have their own unique areas to explore -- and you'll have to explore the galactic map, talk to random characters, and find key items to even trigger many of them. The combat zones themselves, however, have been cleaned up to be more straightforward and compelling, rather than repetitive labyrinths. New gameplay twists are introduced frequently with some large quests eschewing combat entirely. There's a great focus on exploration and discovery here and BioWare has made sure that the reward for doing so is worth the effort. I love the vangaurd. "

        "Content": "Fallout 3 is a special videogame. It's an open-world role-playing game that delivers an experience unlike anything on the market right now. It's a gripping and expansive showcase of how much depth and excitement can be packed into one videogame, and it does justice to the Fallout franchise. This sequel is the first made by Bethesda, the developers responsible for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. You don't need to play any of their past games or any previous Fallout games to enjoy this one. It stands on its own as a memorable and well-crafted videogame. The Fallout universe paints a picture of a dystopian future. It exists in what people on the cusp of the atomic revolution in the 1950s saw as the sci-fi world of tomorrow... if several thousand nuclear bombs were dropped on it. It's a quaint sci-fi view of a future filled with atomic cars, robot servants, and incredibly basic computer terminals. A nuclear war has taken away most of these technological comforts, providing the backdrop for a game with a dreary, desperate atmosphere filled with glib and dark humor. It's a world that is both fantastic and somehow believable. And it is one that's exciting to explore. Game of the Year Edition Bethesda did not deliver a standard Game of the Year Edition by simply adding a few bells and whistles to go along with a price drop. This one contains all five of the downloadable expansions released over the past year and comes at the normal full retail price. Fallout 3 was already a massive game and this just makes it bigger. There isn't anything brand new for those that have been following Fallout 3 and snapping up every expansion as it has become available. The original game is the same and the five add-ons are treated exactly the same as they would be if you had downloaded them. On Xbox 360 and PC, these add-ons come on a second disc that must be installed. You are free to choose which add-ons you want to install and can go back and install or delete the quests at a later date. In total, a little over 2 GB of hard drive space is needed to put all of the expansions on your hard drive at one time. The PS3, with its Blu-ray format, has enough space on the disc to include the original game and all five expansions. No extra installs required. The second disc for Xbox 360 and PC does not appear to have any restrictions placed on it. No code is required to import the add-ons and you don't need to be connected to Xbox Live. I was able to install the add-ons on multiple hard drives without a hitch, and saves carry over for anyone that has started the original Fallout 3 campaign. As far as I can tell, you're free to do what you like with that disc. Not all of the expansions for Fallout 3 were spectacular. If you already own Fallout 3, you might simply want to purchase a few to download rather than upgrading to this fully priced new package. To help you decide what's worth your money, head to our add-on buyer's guide . Or you can read reviews of each individual expansion here: Fallout 3: Operation Anchorage Review Fallout 3: The Pitt Review Fallout 3: Broken Steel Review Fallout 3: Point Lookout Review Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta Review You play as the Vault Dweller, a blank slate for you to write your story on. The game begins with your birth and then quickly moves through childhood with snapshots of pivotal events, such as the day you get your Pip-Boy 3000. It's a cleverly veiled character creation and tutorial sequence that sets the backdrop of the story. You live in Vault 101, a bunker designed to keep its occupants alive through the nuclear war that ravaged the surface. However, this vault didn't reopen when the war finished and as the opening cinematic informs you, it is here you will die because nobody ever enters or leaves Vault 101. But that wouldn't make for a very interesting game. At the end of your childhood, you awake to alarms and confusion. Your father has opened the vault entrance and taken flight. The fragile existence of the other vault inhabitants has been shattered. Nothing will ever be the same, especially for you since it is your charge to leave the relative comfort of Vault 101 and search for your father out in the wastes. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027040302153-000.jpg&caption=The+atmosphere+and+attention+to+detail+are+top+notch. When the vault door rolls back and you step into the sun for the first time, the sense of awe and wonder as you gaze across the wasteland that was once the United States' capital is palpable. Life is absent where it isn't hanging on by a thread. Few buildings remain standing, most reduced to piles of rubble. In the distance you can see what was downtown Washington D.C., a standing but wrecked Washington Monument dominates the skyline as the tallest remaining structure. You can already tell this game is going to be extraordinary. And then your thoughts turn to survival, just as they have for every other human; for every feral dog; for everything. The war did more than crumble the United States government and its infrastructure. It left behind a reminder of man's transgressions. The effects of radiation are felt everywhere, none more strongly than in the water. Thirst and desperation are constants in Fallout 3 and you won't know the true definition of either until you drink irradiated water from a toilet to gain a few health points. Water and food can heal you, but almost everything has been poisoned by radiation. You'll have to use medicine to manage the levels of radiation you take in from eating, drinking or wandering into hot zones, creating an unending give and take that underscores the struggle for survival that everyone you meet faces. Such pressure could make even a good man do bad things. For those who are already bad, it provides the excuse to do great evil and take advantage of the weak. You will have to decide where you fit in this world. If you want to be good, there are beggars to give water to and people that need a champion. If you want to be bad, well let's just say that you won't have any problem finding places to ruin lives. If you haven't figured it out yet, this is not a game for kids or anybody with a developing moral compass. Foul language is pervasive and that is often the smallest sin on screen. Fallout 3 shies away from sexual content and giving you the option to kill little kids, but that's about it. The world is filled with twisted people who do nasty things and you yourself are often presented with the option to perform terrible, terrible acts. Several times while playing as an evil character I found the situations so extreme and wholly wicked that I had trouble taking the low road. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027051550660.jpg&caption=%3Cb%3E%3Ca+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360.ign.com%2Fdor%2Fobjects%2F882301%2Ffallout-3%2Fvideos%2FVATsMontage.html%22+target%3D_blank%3EClick+the+image+to+watch+our+tribute+to+the+Fallout+3+VATS+combat.%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fb%3E But, as they say, karma is a bitch. The choices you make -- be they good, evil or neutral -- will have far reaching consequences. Take the high road and you'll anger the seedier elements in this semi-society. At that point you'll find hit men trying to take you down. Steal from a shopkeeper and they might close up shop and leave. Blow up an entire city... well you can see how that might change things a bit. The conversations you'll have with the various people you meet in Fallout 3 range from disturbing to hilarious, but they all have one thing in common: fantastic writing. You'll want to hear everything every person has to say, but to do that you'll have to play the game more than once and likely more than a few times. While the dialogue system doesn't take the cinematic leap that Mass Effect did, it brings so much depth that the simple listed responses become quite powerful. Some perks, stats and skills add new conversation options. If your strength is high, you might be able to intimidate someone. If you're playing as a female character, you might be able to flirt your way through a sticky situation with some men. Or, if your speech skill is high enough, you might be able to lie your way to key information. The way you talk to the people you meet can drastically change the story. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027034225403-000.jpg&caption=The+Pip-Boy+is+your+best+friend. Unlike many games that offer the level of freedom and choice found here, Fallout 3 has an exciting, top-notch main story. It all comes together for a spectacular climax that is just flat out awesome. Rather than spoil the story, I'll simply say that it does not disappoint. What left me most impressed was how many different ways you can progress through the game. Lying, stealing, hacking, fighting; they're all open for you to use to solve problems. If you play your cards right you can even talk your way into, or luck upon, situations that offer massive shortcuts. The system is so flexible that the possible permutations are almost mind boggling. And yet it all ties back together in the end. And there is a true end to this game. Once you finish Fallout 3 and view the ending, you're booted back to the main menu. You'll have to load up a prior save if you want to continue exploring with that character. The same level of flexibility and focus is found in the side quests of which there are only a dozen or so primary ones. That may not seem like much, but it goes hand in hand with the focused story. Each of these primary side quests can take a few hours to complete and all of them are excellent. You could easily get lost in these for hours and forget that the main quest even exists. And, like the main quest, each side quest feels organic with numerous routes to completion. Beyond that are smaller, non-primary side quests that don't have big stories that accompany them. These are your fetch and collection quests that can be useful for building out your character and killing time, but can't hold a candle to the bigger quests. When it was first announced that Bethesda would be developing Fallout 3, many assumed this would be \"Oblivion with guns.\" While that isn't such a bad prospect, it isn't the case. The heart of the game, experience points, level progression, and character development, runs on an entirely different system. Everything is governed by the base attributes that follow the  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (an acronym for each of the 7 base stats) system. Each of these, in turn, play into individual skills which can be improved through leveling up. And, of course, various things you find in the game such as bobblehead collectibles, books, and certain types of armor can further improve your stats. Unlike Oblivion, you won't be able to perform repetitive actions like swimming or jumping and expect to gain levels. XP is gained through combat, completing quests, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals. And that's it. All experience points go into a single pool and when you level up you get to choose how you want to distribute your skill points. These points aren't tied to your actions at all, so you're free to play as you want and then allocate the points to whatever skills you find most important. See the evolution of the Fallout franchise. Each time you level up, you'll also be given the option to choose a perk. These bonuses are always-on buffs that can do everything from give you a permanent skill or stat boost to reveal locations you haven't visited yet on the map. Some of these are flat-out awesome. The Mr. Sandman perk allows you to instantly kill any sleeping character and get an XP boost for doing it. The Mysterious Stranger perk causes a guy to show up occasionally and blast your enemy into oblivion. You can even get a perk called Cannibalism that allows you to feed on humans after you kill them. That would be for those with bad karma only. The game also doesn't put such an extreme emphasis on leveling up, either. There's a cap at level 20 which took me roughly 40 hours to reach. At that point, you won't even be close to maxing out all of your skills or snagging every perk, which encourages you to go back and start a new character and replay the game. Perhaps the level cap will be lifted when downloadable content releases for Fallout, at least some of which is exclusive to the PC and Xbox 360 versions, but as it stands you'll hit the cap long before you see everything. This is both good and bad: It prevents you from becoming a god-like character, at which point combat wouldn't be exciting. However, it also takes away some of the fun of combat because you don't get any experience points for killing things once you hit the cap. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027034224591-000.jpg&caption=Poor+little+Super+Mutant.+All+he+wants+is+love. If you want a single aspect of the game to show your friends exactly how cool Fallout 3 is, you'll go with the combat. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) is the icing on the cake. The entire game can be played in either a first- or third-person perspective (playing in third-person isn't nearly as enjoyable) as a straight action game. Your accuracy and damage will still be based on your skills and stats, but if you want this game can be played as a simple action-RPG. However, you'd be depriving yourself of one of the coolest combat systems to ever grace an RPG. At any point during combat, you can call on VATS to come to your aid. This pauses the action and allows you to target specific parts of your enemy. Aim for the head and you'll do extra damage. Go for the legs and you can slow down a fast creature. If you want, you can even shoot a grenade in someone's hand to blow them up before they can throw it. You'll see how likely you are to score a hit on each part, taking into account distance, obstacles, and your stats. From there, you can queue up a number of attacks based on your Action Points and let it rip. Each attack through VATS happens in slow-motion while the camera switches to a more cinematic angle. Occasionally, this camera switch can get confused and wind up hiding the action, but most often it delivers an awesome-looking slow-motion attack. Heads get shot off and explode. Arms and legs can get ripped off with spouts of blood pouring from each limb. I once bounced a feral dog off of the ground with an overhand baseball bat swing. The weapons in Fallout 3 are awesome and when you combine them with VATS you get some fantastic results. One thing that surprised me is how well some of the traditionally non-combat oriented skills are incorporated into the action parts of the game. Sneak, primarily used for shady activities like stealing in towns, can be a lifesaver in combat. A sneak attack is an automatic critical hit. The only thing more effective is pick-pocketing a raider and leaving a hand-grenade in place of the stolen item. If you have a high lockpick skill, you'll find that you can open boxes to restock your ammunition supplies which can be a lifesaver on long quests. Raise your science skill enough and you can hack terminals to open doors and avoid combat entirely. Repair allows you to combine similar weapons by scavenging parts from one to raise accuracy and damage on the fly. You'll want a high level on all of these, as well as the combat-oriented skills, but picking which to focus on is part of the role-playing experience. Even once you've beaten the game and done all of the major side quests, there is still a ton to do. Upon completing the main story for the first time, I loaded up an earlier save and took a look at the world map to see how much ground I had covered. It wasn't even close to everything. In fact, it was almost embarrassing how little I'd seen at a point where I felt I had \"beaten\" the game. Since then, I've played dozens more hours and still have yet to see everything. It took me about 20 hours, some of it spent exploring and doing side quests, to complete the story. You could easily spend over 100 hours trying to do and see everything. You'll want to see everything, too. Simply exploring the world in Fallout 3 is rewarding as you brave the wastes and slowly expand your horizons. Each new ruin you find tells a story of its former inhabitants (and brings a few XP points for finding it to boot). Part of what makes it so much fun is the excellent way the game scales to you. From the very start of the game, you can find any of the cool weapons if you know where to look. You can also wander into some areas with enemies that will simply slaughter you. As you progress, the enemies will get tougher along with you, though you'll still run into some low-level baddies that your improved character can destroy. This system gives the satisfaction of feeling like a bad-ass without turning the game into a cake-walk. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027034223763-000.jpg&caption=The+Rock-It+Launcher+lets+you+fire+any+random+garabge+at+enemies.+ The weapon scaling is also quite clever. Early on, the good weapons you find will be in various states of disrepair and only have limited ammo. It's sort of a tease, as you find some cool weapons but can only use them in a limited fashion, but even as a tease, it gives Fallout 3 grounding in reality that many RPGs lack (I've never understood why some RPGs have a progression where each new town you visit has slightly better equipment than the one prior). It also makes the game more fun early on than most games of this length. Who wants to toy around with crappy weapons for hours while trying to level up? Fallout 3 gives you a taste of the best weapons early which helps to make the combat exciting from start to finish. Though, it's almost impossible to say that you're actually finished with the game. Even after you've uncovered every location on the map, you'll find that some places to explore don't even pop up on the map as being found. Hidden raider tunnels, sewers that house collectibles and more are still waiting to be discovered. It's enough to make a budget gamer weep with joy. It's incredible just how much compelling content there is here. It can be quiet out on the wastes while you're exploring and, though it may seem backwards, this minimalist approach to sound only adds to the experience. Your Pip-Boy can pick up radio stations that have a limited set of classic songs and offer some commentary on what is going on in the Capital Wasteland. Wander out of the station's range and you might find yourself with nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains. While so many games assault your ears with licensed popular music, Fallout 3 proves that less can be more. When that music kicks in to signal a battle or you catch some tunes on your Pip-Boy, it's all the more meaningful and engrossing. This comes in contrast with the voice work which most definitely does not take a minimalist approach. Massive amounts of dialogue were recorded for conversations and, since you can play the game as either a male or female, many were even recorded twice. All of it is quite good and a testament to how much sound can add to a game. It's one thing to read text of a kid saying something so nasty that I can't write it here. It's another thing entirely to hear it. Fallout 3 is such an engaging and fantastic experience that it's easy to overlook its few minor flaws, but they do exist and should be mentioned. With any game of this size and scope, you can likely expect a few bugs to slip through the testing process and that is the case here. I had the game crash a couple times, amongst other small bugs. In all of these cases, reloading the game has been enough to fix the errors and nothing was frustrating or detrimental enough to make me not recommend the game. The larger, and far more recognizable, blemish in Fallout 3 that all versions share is the animations. Everything in the world, from the fantastic landscapes to the oftentimes over-the-top personalities therein, comes together to create a believable and engrossing atmosphere. And then you'll see a person or animal move and be given a reminder that this is just a game. The way people move is stiff and lifeless and is a stark contrast to the rest of the outstanding look and feel of Fallout 3. This is especially noticeable in the third-person view. It's great for seeing the unique armor you find, but your character moves awkwardly and doesn't even look like he's interacting with the world he's standing on. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F924%2F924165%2Ffallout-3-20081027034227044-000.jpg&caption=Character+animations+could+be+a+lot+better. Even with the wanting animations, this game is quite the looker. Browns and grays dominate the color palette, creating a stylized and convincing post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's clear that care has been paid to giving Fallout 3 a look that adds to the atmosphere of desperation. And even as the bleak style provides clear limitations in terms of how much visual variety can put into the game (don't expect to see many greens, blues, or bright colors in this fallen civilization filled with death, decay, and remnants of former glory), Bethesda has used attention to detail to create unique locations that beg to be explored. One small bunker I found contained little more than a skeleton at the foot of a locked door. I searched the ground around him and found a book on picking locks and a bobby pin -- safety was just a few feet away, but unreachable. These little implied stories make it fun to explore every little nook. Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions look great, even if they do suffer from occasional framerate issues that cause the game to stutter. The difference in looks between the two console versions is small compared to the leap that comes with a top of the line PC.

        "Content": "Fallout 3 is a special videogame. It's an open-world role-playing game that delivers an experience unlike anything on the market right now. It's a gripping and expansive showcase of how much depth and excitement can be packed into one videogame, and it does justice to the Fallout franchise. This sequel is the first made by Bethesda, the developers responsible for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. You don't need to play any of their past games or any previous Fallout games to enjoy this one. It stands on its own as a memorable and well-crafted videogame.  The Fallout universe paints a picture of a dystopian future. It exists in what people on the cusp of the atomic revolution in the 1950s saw as the sci-fi world of tomorrow... if several thousand nuclear bombs were dropped on it. It's a quaint sci-fi view of a future filled with atomic cars, robot servants, and incredibly basic computer terminals. A nuclear war has taken away most of these technological comforts, providing the backdrop for a game with a dreary, desperate atmosphere filled with glib and dark humor. It's a world that is both fantastic and somehow believable. And it is one that's exciting to explore.   You play as the Vault Dweller, a blank slate for you to write your story on. The game begins with your birth and then quickly moves through childhood with snapshots of pivotal events, such as the day you get your Pip-Boy 3000. It's a cleverly veiled character creation and tutorial sequence that sets the backdrop of the story. You live in Vault 101, a bunker designed to keep its occupants alive through the nuclear war that ravaged the surface. However, this vault didn't reopen when the war finished and as the opening cinematic informs you, it is here you will die because nobody ever enters or leaves Vault 101.  But that wouldn't make for a very interesting game. At the end of your childhood, you awake to alarms and confusion. Your father has opened the vault entrance and taken flight. The fragile existence of the other vault inhabitants has been shattered. Nothing will ever be the same, especially for you since it is your charge to leave the relative comfort of Vault 101 and search for your father out in the wastes.   The atmosphere and attention to detail are top notch. When the vault door rolls back and you step into the sun for the first time, the sense of awe and wonder as you gaze across the wasteland that was once the United States' capital is palpable. Life is absent where it isn't hanging on by a thread. Few buildings remain standing, most reduced to piles of rubble. In the distance you can see what was downtown Washington D.C., a standing but wrecked Washington Monument dominates the skyline as the tallest remaining structure. You can already tell this game is going to be extraordinary.  And then your thoughts turn to survival, just as they have for every other human; for every feral dog; for everything.   The war did more than crumble the United States government and its infrastructure. It left behind a reminder of man's transgressions. The effects of radiation are felt everywhere, none more strongly than in the water. Thirst and desperation are constants in Fallout 3 and you won't know the true definition of either until you drink irradiated water from a toilet to gain a few health points. Water and food can heal you, but almost everything has been poisoned by radiation. You'll have to use medicine to manage the levels of radiation you take in from eating, drinking or wandering into hot zones, creating an unending give and take that underscores the struggle for survival that everyone you meet faces.  Such pressure could make even a good man do bad things. For those who are already bad, it provides the excuse to do great evil and take advantage of the weak. You will have to decide where you fit in this world. If you want to be good, there are beggars to give water to and people that need a champion. If you want to be bad, well let's just say that you won't have any problem finding places to ruin lives. If you haven't figured it out yet, this is not a game for kids or anybody with a developing moral compass. Foul language is pervasive and that is often the smallest sin on screen. Fallout 3 shies away from sexual content and giving you the option to kill little kids, but that's about it. The world is filled with twisted people who do nasty things and you yourself are often presented with the option to perform terrible, terrible acts. Several times while playing as an evil character I found the situations so extreme and wholly wicked that I had trouble taking the low road.   But, as they say, karma is a bitch. The choices you make -- be they good, evil or neutral -- will have far reaching consequences. Take the high road and you'll anger the seedier elements in this semi-society. At that point you'll find hit men trying to take you down. Steal from a shopkeeper and they might close up shop and leave. Blow up an entire city... well you can see how that might change things a bit.  The conversations you'll have with the various people you meet in Fallout 3 range from disturbing to hilarious, but they all have one thing in common: fantastic writing. You'll want to hear everything every person has to say, but to do that you'll have to play the game more than once and likely more than a few times. While the dialogue system doesn't take the cinematic leap that Mass Effect did, it brings so much depth that the simple listed responses become quite powerful. Some perks, stats and skills add new conversation options. If your strength is high, you might be able to intimidate someone. If you're playing as a female character, you might be able to flirt your way through a sticky situation with some men. Or, if your speech skill is high enough, you might be able to lie your way to key information. The way you talk to the people you meet can drastically change the story.   The Pip-Boy is your best friend. Unlike many games that offer the level of freedom and choice found here, Fallout 3 has an exciting, top-notch main story. It all comes together for a spectacular climax that is just flat out awesome. Rather than spoil the story, I'll simply say that it does not disappoint. What left me most impressed was how many different ways you can progress through the game. Lying, stealing, hacking, fighting; they're all open for you to use to solve problems. If you play your cards right you can even talk your way into, or luck upon, situations that offer massive shortcuts. The system is so flexible that the possible permutations are almost mind boggling. And yet it all ties back together in the end. And there is a true end to this game. Once you finish Fallout 3 and view the ending, you're booted back to the main menu. You'll have to load up a prior save if you want to continue exploring with that character.  The same level of flexibility and focus is found in the side quests of which there are only a dozen or so primary ones. That may not seem like much, but it goes hand in hand with the focused story. Each of these primary side quests can take a few hours to complete and all of them are excellent. You could easily get lost in these for hours and forget that the main quest even exists. And, like the main quest, each side quest feels organic with numerous routes to completion.  Beyond that are smaller, non-primary side quests that don't have big stories that accompany them. These are your fetch and collection quests that can be useful for building out your character and killing time, but can't hold a candle to the bigger quests.   When it was first announced that Bethesda would be developing Fallout 3, many assumed this would be \"Oblivion with guns.\" While that isn't such a bad prospect, it isn't the case. The heart of the game, experience points, level progression, and character development, runs on an entirely different system. Everything is governed by the base attributes that follow the  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (an acronym for each of the 7 base stats) system. Each of these, in turn, play into individual skills which can be improved through leveling up. And, of course, various things you find in the game such as bobblehead collectibles, books, and certain types of armor can further improve your stats.  Unlike Oblivion, you won't be able to perform repetitive actions like swimming or jumping and expect to gain levels. XP is gained through combat, completing quests, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals. And that's it. All experience points go into a single pool and when you level up you get to choose how you want to distribute your skill points. These points aren't tied to your actions at all, so you're free to play as you want and then allocate the points to whatever skills you find most important.    Each time you level up, you'll also be given the option to choose a perk. These bonuses are always-on buffs that can do everything from give you a permanent skill or stat boost to reveal locations you haven't visited yet on the map. Some of these are flat-out awesome. The Mr. Sandman perk allows you to instantly kill any sleeping character and get an XP boost for doing it. The Mysterious Stranger perk causes a guy to show up occasionally and blast your enemy into oblivion. You can even get a perk called Cannibalism that allows you to feed on humans after you kill them. That would be for those with bad karma only.  The game also doesn't put such an extreme emphasis on leveling up, either. There's a cap at level 20 which took me roughly 40 hours to reach. At that point, you won't even be close to maxing out all of your skills or snagging every perk, which encourages you to go back and start a new character and replay the game. Perhaps the level cap will be lifted when downloadable content releases for Fallout, at least some of which is exclusive to the PC and Xbox 360 versions, but as it stands you'll hit the cap long before you see everything. This is both good and bad: It prevents you from becoming a god-like character, at which point combat wouldn't be exciting. However, it also takes away some of the fun of combat because you don't get any experience points for killing things once you hit the cap.   Poor little Super Mutant. All he wants is love. If you want a single aspect of the game to show your friends exactly how cool Fallout 3 is, you'll go with the combat. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) is the icing on the cake. The entire game can be played in either a first- or third-person perspective (playing in third-person isn't nearly as enjoyable) as a straight action game.

The Survival Edition of Fallout 3 will cost you an extra an extra $60 over the suggested retail price. It is available exclusively through Amazon.com, and has sold out. It comes with all of the contents of the Collector's Edition as well as a Pip-Boy 3000 clock:   Vault-Tec Bobblehead  The Art of Fallout 3 Book  The Making of Fallout 3 DVD  Vault-Tec Lunch Box  Pip-Boy 3000 Clock   The rest of the swag.   The only difference between the Collector's Edition and the Survival Edition is this Pip-Boy 3000 clock, yet it costs $40 more. The clock is shaped like a Pip-Boy and has hinges so that you can strap it onto your arm, but it doesn't fit comfortably and slides around. The box says it is not intended to be worn.  The clock also comes with a stand to hold the cylindrical shape in place for you. It's all made out of very cheap plastic. The stand broke while I was trying to put it together. The clock doesn't do anything more than tell time -- you can't even use it as an alarm. For so much extra money, we had hoped for some quality memorabilia. The box it comes in has an \"Inspected by 13 for Vault Deployment\" logo on it. Number 13 failed. This is a disappointment.  The rest of the package comes inside the tin lunch box. The box is adorned with some classic Fallout artwork and is pretty attractive. Fans will enjoy the look. Everything comes inside a small tin, which means that the art book is not very big. It has a good amount of art, is hardcover and is 96 pages in length.  However, due to its small size, the art isn't shown off as well as it could be. However, it does have a lot of background info from the developers on the art and how it was created, which is a nice touch.  The \"Making of\" DVD is the same across each platform. This means that if you buy the Collector's Edition on a console, the disc is not formatted to the Xbox 360 or PS3 to add functionality beyond the normal features a DVD has. It also means that none of the video content is in HD.  The disc has two Fallout 3 trailers, poster art and concept art as special features. The trailers are cool, but not in HD and the one dubbed the \"Official Trailer\" switches between standard and widescreen formats midway through. The concept art is a more attractive way to view the images than the small book, which is a nice touch here.  The main feature is all in widescreen and features interviews with the game's makers, spliced together with gameplay footage, concept art and some behind-the-scenes looks at the Bethesda studio. The documentary begins with a bit too strong of a sales vibe for my taste, as if the developers are trying to tell you how cool the game you just bought is. It doesn't really give you a good idea of how the game was made, though there are some cool sections about the art direction and sound. All told, there are enough compelling quips, stories and info that makes it worth watching at least once if you love either Fallout or Bethesda's previous games. Plus you get to watch Liam Neeson talk about recording audio work for a game.  If you're looking for more on Fallout 3, check out the Insider Head-To-Head here ."

It's a world that is both fantastic and somehow believable. And it is one that's exciting to explore.   You play as the Vault Dweller, a blank slate for you to write your story on. The game begins with your birth and then quickly moves through childhood with snapshots of pivotal events, such as the day you get your Pip-Boy 3000. It's a cleverly veiled character creation and tutorial sequence that sets the backdrop of the story. You live in Vault 101, a bunker designed to keep its occupants alive through the nuclear war that ravaged the surface. However, this vault didn't reopen when the war finished and as the opening cinematic informs you, it is here you will die because nobody ever enters or leaves Vault 101.  But that wouldn't make for a very interesting game. At the end of your childhood, you awake to alarms and confusion. Your father has opened the vault entrance and taken flight. The fragile existence of the other vault inhabitants has been shattered. Nothing will ever be the same, especially for you since it is your charge to leave the relative comfort of Vault 101 and search for your father out in the wastes.   The atmosphere and attention to detail are top notch. When the vault door rolls back and you step into the sun for the first time, the sense of awe and wonder as you gaze across the wasteland that was once the United States' capital is palpable. Life is absent where it isn't hanging on by a thread. Few buildings remain standing, most reduced to piles of rubble. In the distance you can see what was downtown Washington D.C., a standing but wrecked Washington Monument dominates the skyline as the tallest remaining structure. You can already tell this game is going to be extraordinary.  And then your thoughts turn to survival, just as they have for every other human; for every feral dog; for everything.   The war did more than crumble the United States government and its infrastructure. It left behind a reminder of man's transgressions. The effects of radiation are felt everywhere, none more strongly than in the water. Thirst and desperation are constants in Fallout 3 and you won't know the true definition of either until you drink irradiated water from a toilet to gain a few health points. Water and food can heal you, but almost everything has been poisoned by radiation. You'll have to use medicine to manage the levels of radiation you take in from eating, drinking or wandering into hot zones, creating an unending give and take that underscores the struggle for survival that everyone you meet faces.  Such pressure could make even a good man do bad things. For those who are already bad, it provides the excuse to do great evil and take advantage of the weak. You will have to decide where you fit in this world. If you want to be good, there are beggars to give water to and people that need a champion. If you want to be bad, well let's just say that you won't have any problem finding places to ruin lives. If you haven't figured it out yet, this is not a game for kids or anybody with a developing moral compass. Foul language is pervasive and that is often the smallest sin on screen. Fallout 3 shies away from sexual content and giving you the option to kill little kids, but that's about it. The world is filled with twisted people who do nasty things and you yourself are often presented with the option to perform terrible, terrible acts. Several times while playing as an evil character I found the situations so extreme and wholly wicked that I had trouble taking the low road.   But, as they say, karma is a bitch. The choices you make -- be they good, evil or neutral -- will have far reaching consequences. Take the high road and you'll anger the seedier elements in this semi-society. At that point you'll find hit men trying to take you down. Steal from a shopkeeper and they might close up shop and leave. Blow up an entire city... well you can see how that might change things a bit.  The conversations you'll have with the various people you meet in Fallout 3 range from disturbing to hilarious, but they all have one thing in common: fantastic writing. You'll want to hear everything every person has to say, but to do that you'll have to play the game more than once and likely more than a few times. While the dialogue system doesn't take the cinematic leap that Mass Effect did, it brings so much depth that the simple listed responses become quite powerful. Some perks, stats and skills add new conversation options. If your strength is high, you might be able to intimidate someone. If you're playing as a female character, you might be able to flirt your way through a sticky situation with some men. Or, if your speech skill is high enough, you might be able to lie your way to key information. The way you talk to the people you meet can drastically change the story.   The Pip-Boy is your best friend. Unlike many games that offer the level of freedom and choice found here, Fallout 3 has an exciting, top-notch main story. It all comes together for a spectacular climax that is just flat out awesome. Rather than spoil the story, I'll simply say that it does not disappoint. What left me most impressed was how many different ways you can progress through the game. Lying, stealing, hacking, fighting; they're all open for you to use to solve problems. If you play your cards right you can even talk your way into, or luck upon, situations that offer massive shortcuts. The system is so flexible that the possible permutations are almost mind boggling. And yet it all ties back together in the end. And there is a true end to this game. Once you finish Fallout 3 and view the ending, you're booted back to the main menu. You'll have to load up a prior save if you want to continue exploring with that character.  The same level of flexibility and focus is found in the side quests of which there are only a dozen or so primary ones. That may not seem like much, but it goes hand in hand with the focused story. Each of these primary side quests can take a few hours to complete and all of them are excellent. You could easily get lost in these for hours and forget that the main quest even exists. And, like the main quest, each side quest feels organic with numerous routes to completion.  Beyond that are smaller, non-primary side quests that don't have big stories that accompany them. These are your fetch and collection quests that can be useful for building out your character and killing time, but can't hold a candle to the bigger quests.   When it was first announced that Bethesda would be developing Fallout 3, many assumed this would be \"Oblivion with guns.\" While that isn't such a bad prospect, it isn't the case. The heart of the game, experience points, level progression, and character development, runs on an entirely different system. Everything is governed by the base attributes that follow the  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (an acronym for each of the 7 base stats) system. Each of these, in turn, play into individual skills which can be improved through leveling up. And, of course, various things you find in the game such as bobblehead collectibles, books, and certain types of armor can further improve your stats.  Unlike Oblivion, you won't be able to perform repetitive actions like swimming or jumping and expect to gain levels. XP is gained through combat, completing quests, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals. And that's it. All experience points go into a single pool and when you level up you get to choose how you want to distribute your skill points. These points aren't tied to your actions at all, so you're free to play as you want and then allocate the points to whatever skills you find most important.    Each time you level up, you'll also be given the option to choose a perk. These bonuses are always-on buffs that can do everything from give you a permanent skill or stat boost to reveal locations you haven't visited yet on the map. Some of these are flat-out awesome. The Mr. Sandman perk allows you to instantly kill any sleeping character and get an XP boost for doing it. The Mysterious Stranger perk causes a guy to show up occasionally and blast your enemy into oblivion. You can even get a perk called Cannibalism that allows you to feed on humans after you kill them. That would be for those with bad karma only.  The game also doesn't put such an extreme emphasis on leveling up, either. There's a cap at level 20 which took me roughly 40 hours to reach. At that point, you won't even be close to maxing out all of your skills or snagging every perk, which encourages you to go back and start a new character and replay the game. Perhaps the level cap will be lifted when downloadable content releases for Fallout, at least some of which is exclusive to the PC and Xbox 360 versions, but as it stands you'll hit the cap long before you see everything. This is both good and bad: It prevents you from becoming a god-like character, at which point combat wouldn't be exciting. However, it also takes away some of the fun of combat because you don't get any experience points for killing things once you hit the cap.   Poor little Super Mutant. All he wants is love. If you want a single aspect of the game to show your friends exactly how cool Fallout 3 is, you'll go with the combat. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) is the icing on the cake. The entire game can be played in either a first- or third-person perspective (playing in third-person isn't nearly as enjoyable) as a straight action game. Your accuracy and damage will still be based on your skills and stats, but if you want this game can be played as a simple action-RPG. However, you'd be depriving yourself of one of the coolest combat systems to ever grace an RPG.  At any point during combat, you can call on VATS to come to your aid. This pauses the action and allows you to target specific parts of your enemy. Aim for the head and you'll do extra damage. Go for the legs and you can slow down a fast creature. If you want, you can even shoot a grenade in someone's hand to blow them up before they can throw it. You'll see how likely you are to score a hit on each part, taking into account distance, obstacles, and your stats. From there, you can queue up a number of attacks based on your Action Points and let it rip.   Each attack through VATS happens in slow-motion while the camera switches to a more cinematic angle. Occasionally, this camera switch can get confused and wind up hiding the action, but most often it delivers an awesome-looking slow-motion attack. Heads get shot off and explode. Arms and legs can get ripped off with spouts of blood pouring from each limb. I once bounced a feral dog off of the ground with an overhand baseball bat swing. The weapons in Fallout 3 are awesome and when you combine them with VATS you get some fantastic results.  One thing that surprised me is how well some of the traditionally non-combat oriented skills are incorporated into the action parts of the game. Sneak, primarily used for shady activities like stealing in towns, can be a lifesaver in combat. A sneak attack is an automatic critical hit. The only thing more effective is pick-pocketing a raider and leaving a hand-grenade in place of the stolen item. If you have a high lockpick skill, you'll find that you can open boxes to restock your ammunition supplies which can be a lifesaver on long quests. Raise your science skill enough and you can hack terminals to open doors and avoid combat entirely. Repair allows you to combine similar weapons by scavenging parts from one to raise accuracy and damage on the fly. You'll want a high level on all of these, as well as the combat-oriented skills, but picking which to focus on is part of the role-playing experience.    Even once you've beaten the game and done all of the major side quests, there is still a ton to do. Upon completing the main story for the first time, I loaded up an earlier save and took a look at the world map to see how much ground I had covered. It wasn't even close to everything. In fact, it was almost embarrassing how little I'd seen at a point where I felt I had \"beaten\" the game. Since then, I've played dozens more hours and still have yet to see everything. It took me about 20 hours, some of it spent exploring and doing side quests, to complete the story. You could easily spend over 100 hours trying to do and see everything.  You'll want to see everything, too. Simply exploring the world in Fallout 3 is rewarding as you brave the wastes and slowly expand your horizons. Each new ruin you find tells a story of its former inhabitants (and brings a few XP points for finding it to boot). Part of what makes it so much fun is the excellent way the game scales to you. From the very start of the game, you can find any of the cool weapons if you know where to look. You can also wander into some areas with enemies that will simply slaughter you. As you progress, the enemies will get tougher along with you, though you'll still run into some low-level baddies that your improved character can destroy. This system gives the satisfaction of feeling like a bad-ass without turning the game into a cake-walk.   The Rock-It Launcher lets you fire any random garabge at enemies. The weapon scaling is also quite clever. Early on, the good weapons you find will be in various states of disrepair and only have limited ammo. It's sort of a tease, as you find some cool weapons but can only use them in a limited fashion, but even as a tease, it gives Fallout 3 grounding in reality that many RPGs lack (I've never understood why some RPGs have a progression where each new town you visit has slightly better equipment than the one prior). It also makes the game more fun early on than most games of this length. Who wants to toy around with crappy weapons for hours while trying to level up? Fallout 3 gives you a taste of the best weapons early which helps to make the combat exciting from start to finish.  Though, it's almost impossible to say that you're actually finished with the game. Even after you've uncovered every location on the map, you'll find that some places to explore don't even pop up on the map as being found. Hidden raider tunnels, sewers that house collectibles and more are still waiting to be discovered. It's enough to make a budget gamer weep with joy. It's incredible just how much compelling content there is here.   It can be quiet out on the wastes while you're exploring and, though it may seem backwards, this minimalist approach to sound only adds to the experience. Your Pip-Boy can pick up radio stations that have a limited set of classic songs and offer some commentary on what is going on in the Capital Wasteland. Wander out of the station's range and you might find yourself with nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains. While so many games assault your ears with licensed popular music, Fallout 3 proves that less can be more. When that music kicks in to signal a battle or you catch some tunes on your Pip-Boy, it's all the more meaningful and engrossing.  This comes in contrast with the voice work which most definitely does not take a minimalist approach. Massive amounts of dialogue were recorded for conversations and, since you can play the game as either a male or female, many were even recorded twice. All of it is quite good and a testament to how much sound can add to a game. It's one thing to read text of a kid saying something so nasty that I can't write it here. It's another thing entirely to hear it.    Fallout 3 is such an engaging and fantastic experience that it's easy to overlook its few minor flaws, but they do exist and should be mentioned. With any game of this size and scope, you can likely expect a few bugs to slip through the testing process and that is the case here. I had the game crash a couple times, amongst other small bugs. In all of these cases, reloading the game has been enough to fix the errors and nothing was frustrating or detrimental enough to make me not recommend the game.  The larger, and far more recognizable, blemish in Fallout 3 that all versions share is the animations. Everything in the world, from the fantastic landscapes to the oftentimes over-the-top personalities therein, comes together to create a believable and engrossing atmosphere. And then you'll see a person or animal move and be given a reminder that this is just a game. The way people move is stiff and lifeless and is a stark contrast to the rest of the outstanding look and feel of Fallout 3. This is especially noticeable in the third-person view. It's great for seeing the unique armor you find, but your character moves awkwardly and doesn't even look like he's interacting with the world he's standing on.   Character animations could be a lot better. Even with the wanting animations, this game is quite the looker. Browns and grays dominate the color palette, creating a stylized and convincing post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's clear that care has been paid to giving Fallout 3 a look that adds to the atmosphere of desperation. And even as the bleak style provides clear limitations in terms of how much visual variety can put into the game (don't expect to see many greens, blues, or bright colors in this fallen civilization filled with death, decay, and remnants of former glory), Bethesda has used attention to detail to create unique locations that beg to be explored. One small bunker I found contained little more than a skeleton at the foot of a locked door. I searched the ground around him and found a book on picking locks and a bobby pin -- safety was just a few feet away, but unreachable. These little implied stories make it fun to explore every little nook.  Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions look great, even if they do suffer from occasional framerate issues that cause the game to stutter. The difference in looks between the two console versions is small compared to the leap that comes with a top of the line PC.  The Collector's Edition of Fallout 3 will cost you an extra an extra $20 over the suggested retail price. For the money, you get:   Vault-Tec Bobblehead  The Art of Fallout 3 Book  The Making of Fallout 3 DVD  Vault-Tec Lunch Box   The Collector's Edition contents. The entire package comes inside the tin lunch box. The box is adorned with some classic Fallout artwork and is pretty attractive. Fans will enjoy the look. Everything comes inside a small tin, which means that the art book is not very big. It has a good amount of art, is hardcover and is 96 pages in length.  However, due to its small size, the art isn't shown off as well as it could be. However, it does have a lot of background info from the developers on the art and how it was created, which is a nice touch.  The \"Making of\" DVD is the same across each platform. This means that if you buy the Collector's Edition on a console, the disc is not formatted to the Xbox 360 or PS3 to add functionality beyond the normal features a DVD has. It also means that none of the video content is in HD.  The disc has two Fallout 3 trailers, poster art and concept art as special features. The trailers are cool, but not in HD and the one dubbed the \"Official Trailer\" switches between standard and widescreen formats midway through. The concept art is a more attractive way to view the images than the small book, which is a nice touch here.  The main feature is all in widescreen and features interviews with the game's makers, spliced together with gameplay footage, concept art and some behind-the-scenes looks at the Bethesda studio. The documentary begins with a bit too strong of a sales vibe for my taste, as if the developers are trying to tell you how cool the game you just bought is. It doesn't really give you a good idea of how the game was made, though there are some cool sections about the art direction and sound. All told, there are enough compelling quips, stories and info that makes it worth watching at least once if you love either Fallout or Bethesda's previous games. Plus you get to watch Liam Neeson talk about recording audio work for a game.  If you're looking for more on Fallout 3, check out the Insider Head-To-Head here ."

It's a gripping and expansive showcase of how much depth and excitement can be packed into one videogame, and it does justice to the Fallout franchise. This sequel is the first made by Bethesda, the developers responsible for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. You don't need to play any of their past games or any previous Fallout games to enjoy this one. It stands on its own as a memorable and well-crafted videogame.  The Fallout universe paints a picture of a dystopian future. It exists in what people on the cusp of the atomic revolution in the 1950s saw as the sci-fi world of tomorrow\u2026if several thousand nuclear bombs were dropped on it. It's a quaint sci-fi view of a future filled with atomic cars, robot servants, and incredibly basic computer terminals. A nuclear war has taken away most of these technological comforts, providing the backdrop for a game with a dreary, desperate atmosphere filled with glib and dark humor. It's a world that is both fantastic and somehow believable. And it is one that's exciting to explore.   You play as the Vault Dweller, a blank slate for you to write your story on.

It's a cleverly veiled character creation and tutorial sequence that sets the backdrop of the story. You live in Vault 101, a bunker designed to keep its occupants alive through the nuclear war that ravaged the surface. However, this vault didn't reopen when the war finished and as the opening cinematic informs you, it is here you will die because nobody ever enters or leaves Vault 101.  But that wouldn't make for a very interesting game. At the end of your childhood, you awake to alarms and confusion. Your father has opened the vault entrance and taken flight. The fragile existence of the other vault inhabitants has been shattered. Nothing will ever be the same, especially for you since it is your charge to leave the relative comfort of Vault 101 and search for your father out in the wastes.   The atmosphere and attention to detail are top notch. When the vault door rolls back and you step into the sun for the first time, the sense of awe and wonder as you gaze across the wasteland that was once the United States' capital is palpable. Life is absent where it isn't hanging on by a thread. Few buildings remain standing, most reduced to piles of rubble.

It took me about 20 hours, some of it spent exploring and doing side quests, to complete the story. You could easily spend over 100 hours trying to do and see everything.  You'll want to see everything, too. Simply exploring the world in Fallout 3 is rewarding as you brave the wastes and slowly expand your horizons. Each new ruin you find tells a story of its former inhabitants (and brings a few XP points for finding it to boot). Part of what makes it so much fun is the excellent way the game scales to you. From the very start of the game, you can find any of the cool weapons if you know where to look. You can also wander into some areas with enemies that will simply slaughter you. As you progress, the enemies will get tougher along with you, though you'll still run into some low-level baddies that your improved character can simply slaughter. This system gives the satisfaction of feeling like a bad-ass without turning the game into a cake-walk.   The Rock-It Launcher lets you fire any random garabge at enemies. The weapon scaling is also done quite cleverly. Early on, the good weapons you find will be in various states of disrepair and only have limited ammo. It's sort of a tease, as you find some cool weapons but can only use them in a limited fashion. Even as a tease, it gives Fallout 3 grounding in reality that many RPGs lack (I've never understood why some RPGs have progression where each new town you visit has slightly better equipment than the one prior). It also makes the game more fun early on than most games of this length. Who wants to toy around with crappy weapons for hours while trying to level up? Fallout 3 gives you a taste of the best weapons early which helps to make the combat exciting from start to finish.  Though, it's almost impossible to say that you're actually finished with the game. Even after you've uncovered every location on the map, you'll find that some places to explore don't even pop up on the map as being found. Hidden raider tunnels, sewers that house collectibles and more are still waiting to be discovered. It's enough to make a budget gamer weep with joy. It's incredible just how much compelling content there is here.   It can be quiet out on the wastes while you're exploring and, though it may seem backwards, this minimalist approach to sound only adds to the experience. Your Pip-Boy can pick up radio stations that have a limited set of classic songs and offer some commentary on what is going on in the Capital Wasteland. Wander out of the station's range and you might find yourself with nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains. While so many games assault your ears with licensed popular music, Fallout 3 proves that less can be more. When that music kicks in to signal a battle or you catch some tunes on your Pip-Boy, it's all the more meaningful and engrossing.  This comes in contrast with the voice work which most definitely does not take a minimalist approach. Massive amounts of dialogue were recorded for conversations and, since you can play the game as either a male or female, many were even recorded twice. All of it is quite good and a testament to how much sound can add to a game. It's one thing to read text of a kid saying something so nasty that I can't write it here. It's another thing entirely to hear it.  Fallout 3 is such an engaging and fantastic experience that it's easy to overlook its few minor flaws, but they do exist and should be mentioned. With any game of this size and scope, you can likely expect a few bugs to slip through the testing process and that is the case here. I had the game crash a couple times, amongst other bugs.  In all of these cases, reloading the game has been enough to fix the errors and nothing was frustrating or detrimental enough to give me thought of not recommending the game.  The larger, and far more recognizable, blemish in Fallout 3 that all versions share is the animations. Everything in the world, from the fantastic landscapes to the oftentimes over-the-top personalities therein, comes together to create a believable and engrossing atmosphere. And then you'll see a person or animal move and be given a reminder that this is just a game. The way people move is stiff and lifeless and is a stark contrast to the rest of the outstanding look and feel of Fallout 3. This is especially noticeable in the third-person view. It's great for seeing the unique armor you find, but your character moves awkwardly and doesn't even look like he's interacting with the world he's standing on.   Character animations could be a lot better. Even with the wanting animations, this game is quite the looker. Browns and grays dominate the color palette, creating a stylized and convincing post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's clear that care has been paid to giving Fallout 3 a look that adds to the atmosphere of desperation. And even as the bleak style provides clear limitations in terms of how much visual variety can put into the game (don't expect to see many greens, blues, or bright colors in this fallen civilization filled with death, decay, and remnants of former glory), Bethesda has used attention to detail to create unique locations that beg to be explored. One small bunker I found contained little more than a skeleton at the foot of a locked door. I searched the ground around him and found a book on picking locks and a bobby pin -- safety was just a few feet away, but unreachable. These little implied stories make it fun to explore every little nook.  If it's pure graphical prowess you're after, the PC version of Fallout 3 is the one you'll want\u2026provided you have a computer that can run the game. The point where top of the line PCs outclassed current consoles has come and gone and even at the same resolution, the extra detail PCs can pump into Fallout 3 is extraordinary. Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions look great, even if they do suffer from occasional framerate issues that cause the game to stutter. The difference in looks between the two console versions is small compared to the leap that comes with a top of the line PC.

        "Content": "Five years after launch, Halo: The Master Chief Collection has finally fulfilled its full fan-service potential with the addition of the last missing game from the Xbox and Xbox 360 era, Halo Reach. It is a genuinely amazing package that now includes six of Microsoft\u2019s classic single-player and co-op campaigns and legendary multiplayer modes, at long last free of any red-flag technical caveats. 343 Industries deserves a ton of credit for sticking with it after a notoriously bad launch and completing the long-term renovation of the house while its occupants lived (and played) inside. It\u2019s admittedly a bit later than I\u2019d anticipated, but the love letter to Master Chief has finally been delivered. Crucially, matchmaking just works . I\u2019ve played around 30 rounds in the past week with no fuss, no drops, no lag, and no BS. As a longtime fan, it\u2019s wonderful that MCC\u2019s interface lets you make awesomely specific game mode requests. Want Big Team Battle in Halo 1? You\u2019ve got it. Want SWAT in Halo 2 or Halo 2 Anniversary? Done. Are you open to any of the games as long as you get an Oddball match? Ask, and ye shall receive. I searched my own Halo-fan heart for the most obscure scenarios I could think of and was obliged every single time. Even Firefight has been imported (from Reach) and it\u2019s still a blast; it\u2019s no wonder it helped fellow Xbox heavyweight Gears of War set off a wave of cooperative PvE multiplayer modes that\u2019s still going strong today. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images Granted, I did often have to wait, sometimes for up to three minutes. Even though The Master Chief Collection is available to everybody on Xbox Game Pass and the community is healthy, this isn\u2019t quite like the Halo 2/Halo 3 heyday where everybody and their mother was playing and you could find a game in seconds. But in every single instance, I always got what I wanted. And when the rounds actually started, they were buttery smooth every single time \u2013 even in Halo 1, which was never designed for online play. Furthermore, quality-of-life features such as a Modern Controls option, customizable and highly specific thumbstick dead zone settings, a text chat window, and a bump to 4K and a now-rock-solid 60fps on the Xbox One X highlight how Master Chief Collection feels like a fresh, modern, living entity rather than just a five-year-old package of even older ports held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands.   Ryan's Ranking of the Halo Games (Overall, Campaign + Multiplayer)   Halo 2  Halo: Combat Evolved  Halo 3  Halo 3: ODST  Halo 4  Halo Reach  Halo 5: Guardians  What's your favorite? What's the best Halo game overall (factoring in campaign AND multiplayer)? Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 2 Halo 3 Halo 3: ODST Halo Reach Halo 4 Halo 5: Guardians Answer See Results  A quick word on Halo Reach, as it\u2019s the most recent addition to MCC and the first part of launching the whole package on PC. In short, for a nine-year-old game, it still looks quite good after its 4K cleanup on both Xbox One and PC, and it controls beautifully. 343\u2019s first PC game feels a lot more natural on mouse and keyboard than when Gearbox brought Halo 1 to PC back in 2003, and offers PC-centric customization options like FOV adjustments. Audio issues are a bit wonky right now, though, with sound levels for various elements being too loud or too soft, but it\u2019s more of an annoyance. If the rest of the Master Chief Collection\u2019s PC ports are up to this standard, that\u2019ll be excellent news. All of the previously included campaigns have aged gracefully, too. Halo 4 remains underappreciated, and with its 4K/60fps enhancement it still looks like a recent game on Xbox One X. Halo 3, ODST (also new since MCC\u2019s original launch), and Reach are largely unchanged outside of the resolution and framerate bump, and even Combat Evolved looks surprisingly clean, image quality-wise, for an almost 20-year-old game. It\u2019s a classic for a reason. Halo 2\u2019s Anniversary treatment, meanwhile \u2013 which enhanced both the campaign and a select group of multiplayer maps (everything\u2019s available, though most of it hasn\u2019t gotten the facelift) is holding up nicely. Here\u2019s what I said about it in my 2014 review, all of which remains true today: \u201cI jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014\u2019s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges \u2013 I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they\u2019re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don\u2019t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s parts \u2013 most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second \u2013 trumps its minor annoyances.\u201d   About My Original Review This one has always bothered me. See, I got my original review of 2014\u2019s Halo: The Master Chief Collection wrong. I held it for a few days after launch at the time, hoping 343 would patch up the then-four-game collection\u2019s catastrophic matchmaking and connectivity issues, and then I put a 9.0 on it on the strength of its four fantastic campaigns and the faith that the multiplayer issues would be resolved soon enough. As it turned out, of course, The Master Chief Collection didn\u2019t deserve the benefit of the doubt. What should\u2019ve been a dream package for Halo fans was instead a nightmare on the multiplayer side. And for our part, we learned an important lesson and soon began making more use of reviews in progress for server-dependant games in order to help prevent this from happening again. Fast-forward five years and a lot has changed. Xbox Game Pass is a thing now, and any subscriber gets full access to MCC. The Xbox One X also exists, and playing MCC on it gives you 4K resolution. Even better, the collection has grown to six games, adding Halo 3: ODST and, most recently, Halo Reach (including Firefight mode). The latter is also now available on PC \u2013 via Steam, no less! \u2013 and serves as the starting point for bringing the whole shebang faithfully to Windows, game by game, between now and Halo Infinite\u2019s launch in Fall 2020.

        "id": "1d0b97f258691ff84ac2f28ee40700c1",
        "Content": "Within the first minutes of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, there\u2019s no missing the fact that FromSoftware has built its Shinobi-focused adventure from the DNA of the Souls and Bloodborne series. But this new mutated strain is as much its own stealth-action experience, one that\u2019s more focused, cohesive, and in some ways forgiving, despite retaining its predecessors' trademark difficulty. As I rolled credits after 50 hours of pressurized-blood-geyser executions, fantastical monster fights, split-second swordsmanship, and sprawling, secret-filled areas, I\u2019m left with a deep appreciation for this amazing journey and the skills it demands to master it. To any Souls veteran, Sekiro\u2019s timing-based lock-on combat of strikes and slashes is familiar, as is the way you weave through the same excellently designed levels that snake, interconnect, and double back on themselves to reveal new shortcuts between little bastions of safety to resupply. Functionally equivalent to bonfires from Dark Souls , or Lanterns in Bloodborne , the Sculptor\u2019s Idols are where you\u2019ll rest, recover your healing draughts, reset slain enemies, access your character progression, and of course, teleport between them for a snappy fast travel. While I certainly enjoy punishing games that test me and my skills (and have proudly bested everything FromSoftware has thrown at me in this genre) there\u2019s a sense of empowerment that comes from Sekiro\u2019s generally more forgiving nature. For example, due to the seemingly smaller, more linear paths relative to the sprawling hellscapes of other FromSoftware games, I never felt like I had to go too far to find the next Idol and bank my progress. That regular cadence relieves a lot of the oppressive anxiety in wondering if all your work will be taken from you before you can make it to the next checkpoint, and once or twice I simply sprinted through an area, assuming an Idol was just on the other side. It usually was. That relieving sense of safety in Sekiro allowed me to appreciate the mechanical complexities of it in a way I couldn\u2019t if I was terrified of taking any chances. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d wish for every game of this genre to embrace, but it\u2019s refreshing and new. Go Your Own Way There\u2019s a sense of empowerment that comes from Sekiro\u2019s generally more forgiving nature. \u201c Though many of the mechanics and level design philosophies of this mystical take on Japan\u2019s Sengoku period (between 1467 and 1615) are nearly identical to the formula laid out previously, Sekiro is immediately its own beast when it comes to stealth, combat, and movement thanks to a Swiss-army-knife of a prosthetic arm strapped to your titular Shinobi character. Its most apparent trick is a built-in grappling hook that can send you flying to the rooftops at a whim, which sends ripples throughout the gameplay. Where all previous Soulsborne characters felt rooted firmly to the ground as they trudged down hallways and slowly climbed ladders, Sekiro\u2019s level design has permission to be much more vertical. Between jumping and zip-lining between anchors, that sense that you\u2019re only ever a dead end away from being cornered, overwhelmed, and murdered in some dark alcove is an almost non-existent concern. When I got into trouble, there was almost always a way out if I thought like a ninja instead of a knight. And this new mobility reinforces the stealth elements of Sekiro, allowing you to get into advantageous positions for silent assassinations, quickly escape danger and hide to reset a botched encounter, or just explore the varied grounded and mythical environments. When I first reached Anor Londo in Dark Souls or Yharnam in Bloodborne, the sheer scope of the cities was astounding. When I first set foot in the Ashina Castle complex, I was struck with the same sense of wonder but also completely blown away when I learned I could zip between buildings and rooftops for unprecedented freedom in a FromSoftware megacity. Speeding up the process of exploration was a thrilling change of pace. Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review 49 Images That same feeling extends to sneaking and battling through the mist-covered forests of the Ashina Depths, and the sheer frozen cliff faces of the Sunken Valley, that make up a small part of the journey through Sekiro. With this freedom, complex environments like these take on an almost platformer-like carefree fun rather than the familiar sense of imposing dread that these places are yet another obstacle in your way. Sure, they\u2019re still loaded with things that want to kill you, but your liberating movement helps to expose the world as a place that isn\u2019t maliciously adding to the pain of getting from one point to the next. Don\u2019t worry: some of FromSoftware\u2019s worldbuilding staples still make the cut in Sekiro: the bottomless pit, the poisonous (dare I say Blighttown-like) pools in the depths of the Earth, and the pitch-black dungeon in the castle underbelly are all comfort food for the faithful. But the moments spent carefully navigating these damnable places are balanced by the sun-kissed surface where swinging between trees and buildings is revitalizing. Second Chances And, as the subtitle \u201cShadows Die Twice\u201d suggests, that focus on freedom extends beyond death. As an undying Shinobi, you\u2019re gifted with the ability to resurrect yourself upon death, though this comes with a number of considerations that make doing so a decision you have to consider carefully each time. The foundation is essentially thus: if you die, you just lose half the experience and currency you\u2019ve collected \u2013 and you no longer have the option to run to your corpse to collect your dropped goods. (The only exception to this is a mechanic called Unseen Aid, which is essentially divine intervention giving you a penalty-free death.) If you die, you lose half the experience and currency you\u2019ve collected. \u201c This is where things get tricky. Every time you rest at an Idol you\u2019re given a single-use resurrection (you can normally have a max of one at a time) which you can decide to use once you\u2019ve been struck down \u2013 and you will be. Sekiro is, after all, a FromSoftware game, and death is part of the learning experience. But if you die a second time before reaching another Idol there\u2019s a chance your tampering with the divine forces of resurrection will cause the cosmic disease called Dragon Rot to affect NPCs throughout the world. In the fiction, these characters become visibly sick, but the mechanical cost is that your chance to trigger Unseen Aid will be reduced, each time degrading from the maximum of 30% until you hit the minimum of 5%, mitigating that hail Mary effect on death. It\u2019s an effective reminder that there are still consequences for dying, but because there are ways to bank your money and you don\u2019t lose experience once you\u2019ve reached certain thresholds that convert experience into skill points, the danger is relatively slim. Early on, I just accepted that dying meant losing half my unbanked experience and currency and so I was never bothered by the penalty. To me, the forgiving nature of Sekiro that allows you to usually get out of a bad situation meant that if I let myself die, I probably could have avoided it, and losing my resources was mostly my fault. And in the event Unseen Aid triggered, well, it was just a nice surprise. Since Sekiro is less about managing your resources than it is about raw skill with a sword, I can appreciate the penalty keeping me honest, while also appreciating that I wasn\u2019t truly hamstrung by zigging when I should have zagged. There are ways to use additional resurrections beyond the first, tied to killing enemies or bosses with deathblow attacks and are fairly self-explanatory once you get into the swing of things thanks to Sekiro\u2019s uncharacteristic penchant for explaining its mechanics in a way Dark Souls or Bloodborne never did. In the end, the real decision-making I would wring my hands over when it came to whether or not I should resurrect upon death boiled down to whether or not I thought I could finish a fight I\u2019d lost, based on my supplies and the state of my opponent. If I\u2019d whittled him down to next to nothing, then I\u2019d pop back up to finish the job; but if I\u2019d used most of my healing draughts without doing much damage to my killer there\u2019d be no reason to rise from defeat. I\u2019d take my death on the chin and try again, this time with a little more knowledge of what not to do.   Alone at Last In a first for a game of this type from FromSoftware, Sekiro is an entirely single-player experience, and that has both advantages and disadvantages. The most immediately noticeable pro is that, due to the fact there\u2019s no persistent multiplayer, you\u2019re able to pause mid-fight, which is its own second chance mechanic, in a way. Did you miss a dodge and eat the full brunt of a poison attack? No problem \u2013 hit pause, use an antidote item, and get back to it without having to fumble through your inventory as you\u2019re dodging for your life. That ability to call timeout and tend to your ailing status sucks a lot of the venom out of a tough battle. That said, I do at times miss the small notes left by others in the world alerting me to imminent threats or hidden secrets, or that vague sense that danger lurks behind me in the form of an invading player. But Sekiro is a more streamlined experience, and more direct, meaning the value of player-placed clues would already be mitigated, so the loss isn\u2019t felt as strongly as I\u2019d feared it would be. The real disappointment is the lack of PvP battles, which seems like a waste of the new emphasis on skill-based swordsmanship. It\u2019s not quite as in-depth as something like For Honor, but I could see a unique community evolving around the rock-paper-scissors formula, with sword fights between rival player-Shinobi lasting minutes at a time.  Live by the Sword, Die by the Sword When you\u2019re not skulking around looking to get the drop on your enemies to score easy kills with stylishly gory execution animations that spray gushes of blood in every direction like a rotating lawn sprinkler, the emphasis of Sekiro\u2019s combat is on skill-based swordsmanship that requires a mastery of an excellent new rock-paper-scissors countering system. While parries and dodges have always had an organic feel in Bloodborne and the Souls series, in Sekiro they\u2019re much more heavily emphasized and crucial to finding any measure of success against enemies big and small. Sekiro\u2019s combat is skill-based swordsmanship that requires a mastery of an excellent new countering system. \u201c Peppered in with the standard fare of attacks are specific thrusts, sweeps, and grapples that are difficult, if not impossible, to simply block or dodge. But these, of course, come with the fairness of telegraph animations, with a literal big red sign for DANGER appearing on screen and giving you a split second to figure out what\u2019s coming and how to counter this specific type of attack. Thrust attacks must be deflected or redirected, sweep attacks must be jumped over, and grapples must be step-dodged. Done properly, it becomes a regularly thrilling exchange of clashing blades, precision timing, and tactics that looks as great in action as it feels to execute. There\u2019s a steep curve to mastering it, though, because the timing windows between telegraph and delivery are so varied and often so narrow. But once I overwrote my reactionary muscle memory of just trying to get the hell out of dodge when I saw a big attack coming I found a simple beauty in being able to stand toe-to-toe with any enemy. It took a while, for sure, to let that sink in. But after I was beaten to death dozens of times for instinctually dodging backward when my attack was blocked, I finally started to realize that standing your ground and living by the sword meant I would die less often (also by the sword). And when a 15-foot-tall monstrosity swings 10 times at you in quick succession and you\u2019re able to not just block but deflect the flurry of attacks, there\u2019s a sense you\u2019re the greatest swordsman that ever lived. Once I overwrote my muscle memory I found a simple beauty in being able to stand toe-to-toe with any enemy. \u201c And in time, this process actually makes Sekiro more forgiving and somewhat easier than its predecessors. In part, that\u2019s because as you appropriately counter the attacks of towering monsters and impossibly lethal assassins they\u2019re almost always left open to attack immediately afterward. You\u2019ve got a guaranteed window to punish them if you can pull it off, which is reassuring to know when you\u2019ve locked swords with a seemingly invincible enemy for the first time. Beating your enemies into submission with raw damage alone isn\u2019t the only option, however, because Sekiro introduces variety in ways to take down opponents with the idea of posture: composure during a fight that\u2019s effectively a second, parallel health bar. As you exchange attacks and counters, both you and your opponents will chip away at one another\u2019s posture meter. When you do unblocked damage, you degrade their posture. When you deflect their attacks, you degrade their posture. And when they block your attacks, you\u2019re degrading their posture. This means that enemies who constantly block \u2013 never allowing you to chip away at their health \u2013 can still be taken down because when you eventually break their posture they\u2019re immediately open to a deathblow. This system reinforces the idea of standing toe-to-toe being the best way to fight because let\u2019s say you deflect an attack, cut them with an unblocked quick slash, and then swing another blow toward them that they block. Sure, you only did a small amount of damage, but all three actions degraded their posture. Keep up that pressure and you\u2019ll find your sword in their neck in no time, which means that fights never feel like they could drag on forever. One way or another, even a fight between perfectly matched adversaries will have a victor. Sekiro continuously throws a variety of unique and challenging enemies at you that reliably ratchet up the pressure and complexity. \u201c Not all enemies need to be bested with martial prowess. Occasionally, I\u2019d come across a monster that simply hit too hard, or too wildly, to risk attempting deflections with any consistency \u2013 as was the case with one particularly nasty giant headless ape. In these times, the old reliable tactic of sprinting in circles around it until it swung big and missed gave me the opportunity to quickly stab it in the back over and over and over. Old habits die hard. Which route you take to get the kill matters less when facing the rank-and-file threats \u2013 they quickly die in a shower of gore when you apply constant attacks \u2013 but Sekiro continuously throws a variety of unique and challenging enemies at you that reliably ratchet up the pressure and complexity. Whether it\u2019s a corrupted monk with a massive halberd, a twisted quadrupedal monster with Wolverine claws for hands, expert swordsmen, one-armed ninjas, gun-toting hill people, or supernatural threats from the other side, taking down each enemy means different tactics, and there\u2019s rarely much overlap. Learning their moves and abilities becomes a tricky dance of flexibility, and while there are less than a dozen Bosses \u2013 those with a capital B \u2013 the world is positively lousy with high-health, highly capable minibosses that serve as skill-checks to keep you on your toes and your reflexes sharp. Tools of the Trade Relative to its predecessors, Sekiro\u2019s character progression is admirably streamlined. There are no attributes or numbers to build up by grinding Souls or Blood. You don\u2019t increase your Strength to do more damage \u2013 there\u2019s no Strength. Instead, your Vitality (health) and Attack Power (damage) only increase as you receive and spend key items you earn by taking down bosses and difficult enemies (of which there are a finite amount, though ways to further inflate toward the end do exist). There are no real weapons to find, or armor to acquire. Outside of \u2013 outside of one or two others that serve a purpose in the story, you\u2019ll use the same trusty katana from the start of this 50-hour adventure to the finish. Sekiro places emphasis on getting better with what you can do rather than looking for another weapon or piece of armor. \u201c In this way, you already have the foundation to succeed in Sekiro, which places emphasis on getting better with what you can do rather than looking for another weapon or piece of armor to complete some gear-check gimmicky encounter. What fun and varied functionality new weapons and armor would add to the gameplay is mirrored in the inventive prosthetic tools , so the experience of finding new mechanical advantages throughout the adventure isn\u2019t lost entirely. Instead of buying attribute points, the experience you earn is cashed into Skill Points which you spend on a robust, tiered, multi-page skill tree that allows you to unlock passive skills like a more potent stealth for easier assassinations. You might buy the ability to recover health when performing a deathblow (which is hands-down one of the most valuable passive skills I\u2019ve gotten in Sekiro) or increase the max number of Spirit Emblems you can hold, which allows you to make more frequent use of your prosthetic tools. For active skills, there are a wealth of combat maneuvers like devastating posture-pounding strikes, lightning-fast flurries of slashes, secret sword techniques that kill in the blink of an eye, and so many more. There are, in fact, a staggering number of abilities, skills, and combat techniques to unlock and, incredibly, each one I used felt unique and useful, even if only in specific situations. Similarly, the prosthetic limb can be outfitted with a number of different gadgets that must first be found in the world and then upgraded with precious materials. These tools really open up your options as you go, and like the aforementioned combat skills, many serve a distinct purpose. The Firecrackers, for example, can startle beasts, which is helpful when you\u2019re attacked by a pack of wolves, face an enemy mounted on a horse, or come face to face with a flaming bull on a rampage. Alternatively, the Loaded Spear is great for pulling weaker enemies toward you to keep them in range, and can also strip loose-fitting armor off of foes \u2013 though this never really seemed to be much of an occurrence. The Flamethrower says what it is and does what it says, but it\u2019s more than a straightforward damage-over-time device because certain rage-prone foes fear only fire, so blowing a pipe full of flames in their face leaves them open to follow up attacks. Firecrackers, for example, can startle beasts, which is helpful when you\u2019re attacked by a pack of wolves. \u201c Some of these tools seem more universal than others: the always-handy Shuriken is essential for consistent long-range damage, and the Mist Raven Feather that lets you phase through enemy attacks and reappear next to, behind, or above them for some life-saving distance and an unprotected vantage point got me out of countless jams. Others, like the Loaded Umbrella that blocks incoming projectiles or the Loaded Axe that smashes shields to splinters, are supremely useful, vital even, in their narrow, intended purpose, and rarely outside of that. These tools also come with their own excellent upgrade trees that require precious resources to build into but produce better and better versions of themselves. That Loaded Umbrella is still useful by default, but when you upgrade it to negate all damage from apparitions \u2013 which cause the Terror status that will instantly kill you if you take too much \u2013 it\u2019s a game-changer. Though expensive, when you finally build some of these up to tier two, three, or four tools and combine them with unlockable skills, they\u2019re absolutely devastating in a way that\u2019s not only flexible but regularly fun in seeing what lethal synergies between tools, skills, and abilities you can come up with. World at War While there\u2019s no shortage of rich Japanese atmosphere in the background, Sekiro\u2019s story is where I connected with it the least. On the one hand, it\u2019s a much more straightforward tale than FromSoftware usually deals in, as your undying, one-armed Shinobi dutifully serves, protects, and endlessly murders at the behest of your master, a child Divine Heir blessed with immortality. On the other, because Sekiro is much more linear in its tasks, because the characters actually speak to you in coherent sentences and give you direction, and because there are ample clues and hints throughout the world that let you draw correct conclusions, it\u2019s easy to blow through the journey without ever needing to stop and ponder, as I\u2019ve come to expect in a FromSoftware game. While Sekiro starts out like a work of historical fiction it quickly takes a hard turn into the mystical and supernatural. \u201c That\u2019s not something that\u2019s inherently bad \u2013 far from it \u2013 but I realized that through the majority of the time I was playing Sekiro I was just doing what other people told me to do. I wasn\u2019t discovering or uncovering or deciding what needed to be done, I was given orders and I\u2019d follow them to the letter until the next set of orders, and so on, as though they\u2019d accompanied each demand with a \u201cWould you kindly?\u201d Until I finally got to the point about X way through the campaign where I started making key decisions that changed the course of the story and determined which of the possible endings I\u2019d see, I was feeling a bit powerless over my fate. And while Sekiro starts out like a work of historical fiction in a bloody but atmospheric period of Japanese history, in typical FromSoftware fashion it quickly takes a hard turn into the mystical and supernatural. Granted, it has to, since resurrection is a core feature and all existing scientific data points suggests that 15th-century Japanese people couldn\u2019t actually do that, but it\u2019s done so in a way that\u2019s both relatively grounded in reality and rooted in actual mythology, which I genuinely appreciate. These incredible environments ripped straight from myth and legend regularly overshadow the actual story in a welcome, compensatory way. Moments of traipsing through divine gardens, reliving memories from the past, and tangling with fantastical beasts all deliver a unified vision of a world that straddles this plane and the next, and I loved it. The vibrant, colorful sights and moody, atmospheric sounds create a varied world, set to a period-appropriate soundtrack that\u2019s equal parts calming and haunting. Though Sekiro is overall a less obtuse FromSoftware experience and things are more straightforward, the world still retains much of that mystery that makes these games so engaging. You\u2019ll find an item with seemingly no purpose or hear a rumor of a sword that can open a portal to the afterlife, or maybe just see a building on a cliff that doesn\u2019t seem reachable. When I solved some of these riddles, I was bound to Sekiro in the same excellent way as I was bound to Bloodborne when I finally saw the unseeable, or helped Solaire become so grossly incandescent in Dark Souls. And perhaps as importantly, the nagging clues I\u2019ve uncovered and yet to solve will stoke the fires of my run into the New Game+."

        "Content": "The first Devil May Cry sparked my love of action games in general, but as the series has gone on it\u2019s kept that place in my heart because they aren\u2019t just about killing every enemy in a room. They\u2019re about how you killed every enemy in a room, expressing yourself in an almost artistic and highly technical dance of swords, guns, and lots of jump cancels. Devil May Cry 5 is the new pinnacle of this particular subset of the genre, thanks to a perfectly paced campaign that mixes in three completely different playstyles, each of which containing enough depth to carry a game of their own; a fun and satisfying story; and quite simply one of the best combat systems you\u2019ll find in video games.  Devil May Cry 5\u2019s story is somewhat unconventional in that it starts with events that would normally feel like the climax: you\u2019re thrown right into a fight you\u2019re meant to lose. After Dante stays behind to let Nero and a new character named V escape from a super-powered demon king named Urizen, the story jumps around a time period of a couple of months, rotating through perspectives as it tells the present-day story of Dante, Nero, and V, while also explaining the circumstances that led to Urizen\u2019s rise to power and V\u2019s quest to take him down.  There\u2019s a great air of mystery to the unknown nature of both Urizen and V. Like Nero, I was never sure if I could trust V and found myself formulating theory after theory about his identity and motives with every new morsel of information that was fed to me. By the end of its 10 to 12 hours I still had some questions left over, but overall the plot kept me hooked all the way through with satisfying revelations, a few answers that fill in some long-standing series plot holes, and of course, the off-the-wall action that only Devil May Cry can deliver. Devil May Cry 5\u2019s combat is absolutely sublime. On the surface, it\u2019s a very simple system: There\u2019s one button for melee attacks, one for ranged attacks, and one for your Devil Breaker, style technique, or cane attack, depending on which character you\u2019re using. If that\u2019s as deep as you want to go, you can absolutely get through the campaign on normal difficulty just fine with nothing more. There\u2019s even an \u201cauto-assist\u201d mode that automatically performs cool and flashy combos by just mashing the attack button, letting even casual players feel what it\u2019s like to play at a higher technical level. The beauty of DMC 5\u2019s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and variety. \u201c But the beauty of Devil May Cry 5\u2019s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and variety its three sets of tools offer. If you\u2019re playing as Nero, those tools are your revvable Red Queen sword, chargeable Blue Rose handgun, a grapple that can pull enemies towards you, and an ever-growing arsenal of Devil Breakers, which are disposable mechanical arms that each provide Nero with new abilities and utility. My favorite, Punchline, shoots out an arm that homes in on an enemy and keeps them in place with quick rocket punches. But the real fun starts when you hold down the Devil Breaker button while Punchline is out, allowing you to jump on top of it and ride it like a hoverboard, knocking enemies up into the air with flips, 360s, and other sick stunts. Dante\u2019s gameplay is by far the most familiar because he plays almost exactly the same as his Devil May Cry 4 counterpart, which is to say that he\u2019s essentially a Swiss army knife. He can swap between four distinct styles (Trickster, Royal Guard, Gunslinger, and Swordmaster) four melee weapons , and four ranged weapons, all on the fly. His arsenal is a fantastic mix of old and new, with the old weapons kept fresh thanks to a number of new tweaks and techniques, and the new weapons adding new layers to Dante\u2019s combat that he\u2019s never had before. He even has a motorcycle that he can crash into enemies with and then transform into two slow but heavy-hitting buzzsaw swords and back again, all in the space of a single combo. V plays completely unlike any character in any Devil May Cry game. \u201c And then finally there\u2019s V, who plays completely unlike any character in any Devil May Cry game due to the fact that he barely does any of the fighting himself. Instead, he summons three familiars to do battle for him: There\u2019s Shadow, a black cat that can morph into various blades and creatures; Griffon, a bird that can fire a variety of electrical blasts from a distance; and Nightmare, a gargantuan beast that can only be summoned when V builds up his Devil Trigger meter. Nightmare fights completely autonomously, and it can be very extremely satisfying to watch him emerge through a wall or rain down from the sky and just wreck a whole crowd of enemies. Your familiars can\u2019t actually kill anything, though, so V has to teleport around and deliver the finishing blow with his cane once an enemy has been primed for the kill. That leads to some very cool kill sequences where V just blinks from enemy to enemy, wiping them out one by one while your familiars carry on the fight in the background. Using V effectively has a pretty steep learning curve, even by Devil May Cry standards, due to the fact that you don\u2019t actually have any directional control over Shadow or Griffon. Getting them to attack a specific enemy can be a challenge, and trying to keep track of where they are in relation to the enemy can also be tricky. However, you can use some of your Devil Trigger meter to have them autonomously attack, allowing you to focus on dodging. Or, if you feel you have a few moments of safety you could read a book and regain some of that meter... Or just play some violin to taunt them. Even so, V\u2019s missions are the weakest of the trio, mainly because his movement feels so much more limited compared to Dante and Nero. But that\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re bad by any stretch. Once you get a couple of upgrades for Shadow and Griffon under your belt and get used to the flow of combat, V\u2019s unique gameplay becomes quite fun, and it\u2019s used sparingly enough to never outstay its welcome.   Microtransaction Reaction  There are eight Devil Breakers in the base game for Nero to equip, but there are also four more that are sold separately as DLC (and included in the $70 Deluxe Edition). The four DLC breakers include The Pasta Breaker, an arm with a fork attached to the end that shoots out to continuously attack an enemy, push them away, and then returns them to you; The Mega Buster, a gun arm that\u2019s a direct nod to the Mega Buster from Mega Man; The Gerbera GP01, a modified version of the Gerbera Devil Breaker; and the Sweet Surrender, which can heal Nero moderately over time, or be charged for a quick burst of health. Another Deluxe Edition piece of DLC is the Cavaliere R, which is pretty much the exact same as the Cavaliere that Dante obtains naturally, with the exception of a slick red paint job, and one awesome technique that causes Dante to fly towards an enemy at high speed. None are essential but they\u2019re all pretty fun to use, with the exception of Sweet Surrender, which felt like a waste of an inventory slot since its only purpose is to heal. I could see getting the Pasta Breaker and Gerbera for $1 each, but $3 for each of the others doesn\u2019t seem worth it for what they add.  It should also be duly noted that you can purchase Red Orbs, Devil May Cry 5\u2019s main source of currency, with real money. That\u2019s always a bad look. That being said, the Red Orb cost of just about every upgrade and technique feels appropriately priced (aside from one special technique for each character that\u2019s clearly there for high-level players to strive for), and I never felt any kind of need or desire to drop real cash on Red Orbs, nor did I ever feel like I had to farm them in-game. It should be said that Devil May Cry 5 looks and sounds stellar. Style and personality oozes out every animation, whether it\u2019s Nero\u2019s wild engine-powered sword attacks that send him flying across the level, Dante\u2019s smug teasing of the various bosses, or V\u2019s subtle mannerisms that just add to his mystique. Level design is more linear and much less puzzle-heavy relative to previous Devil May Cry games, which I appreciated, as it kept the brisk pace up and put more of an emphasis on skill-based combat challenges. Like, for example, there are a few where you must kill a pack of enemies before their weight causes the platform to fall, which would seal off a hidden room with goodies. That being said, the environments are not as varied as they have been in the past, and you\u2019ll be traveling through a lot of similarly demon-torn cityscapes and hellish underground chasms. The 10 Best Devil May Cry Weapons, Ranked 11 Images Though the Devil May Cry games have a bit of a reputation for being difficult, on its default settings DMC5 isn\u2019t terribly hard. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite forgiving if all you want to do is survive the ordeal. When you die, you can use a Gold Orb to revive on the spot with all your health and Devil Trigger meters refilled, and those aren\u2019t hard to come by: You can often find them off the beaten path in a level, you earn one per day as a daily login bonus, or you can have your performance rated positively in the weird cameo system, which records a ghost of your character when you play through certain levels and adds that ghost into another player\u2019s game. If you run out of Gold Orbs (I was swimming in them by the end) you can also spend the much more common Red Orbs to revive with and buy back health. It\u2019s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the enemies in the room. \u201c Staying alive isn\u2019t really the challenge, though. As I said at the start, what I love about Devil May Cry as a series is that it\u2019s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the enemies in the room. Trying to get SSS ranks is a real worthwhile challenge that made up for the lack of base difficulty. To that end, I sprang at every opportunity to buy new techniques, which is rewarding because Devil May Cry 5 is paced in such a way that you are constantly getting new toys at just about every turn \u2013 whether it be a new form, weapon, or Devil Breaker \u2013 and they all come with their own set of new upgrades. By the end of the story all three of my characters felt like all-powerful gods, with even more upgrades still left to be purchased for my next run in the unlockable Son of Sparda mode , which is essentially New Game+ and where the true challenge of Devil May Cry 5 starts to rear its head. Finally, a great combat system isn\u2019t worth much if the enemies aren\u2019t fun to fight, but fortunately Devil May Cry 5\u2019s meet the high standards set by previous games in the series. There\u2019s a great mix of common fodder enemies that allow you to do basically whatever you want to them to build your combos, tanky enemies that require specific tactics to bypass their defenses, and powerful support baddies that can deal big damage from afar and can be very threatening if not brought down quickly. The same goes for bosses, with a few of the later fights being among the strongest the series has seen. There\u2019s a solid variety of them too, with several towering and powerful beasts, others who are agile and elusive, but the best are just straight up one-on-one duels with high-speed action that require quick reflexes and a careful balance of offense and defense."

        "Content": "On my second run through Dead Cells I made it to the last level and was pretty sure I had it figured out. 63 runs later, when I finally took down the boss and stepped into my post-game replay, I\u2019m one-hundred-percent sure I\u2019m just now starting to understand the deep nuances of Motion Twin\u2019s incredible action-platformer. Dead Cells is a triumph of shockingly good game design: the ever-changing guts of its beautifully illustrated levels, a staggering array of game-changing weapons and gadgets, and its breakneck motion fuse into an engrossing loop. It\u2019s so engaging that even after dozens of hours clawing through its island fortress, I\u2019m still discovering and devouring new morsels. Choice and Consequence The heart of Dead Cells is its layered commitment to risk and reward. At its surface you\u2019re a decapitated prisoner reanimated for some unknown reason to run through a dozen levels that are gorgeously detailed \u2014 even though they\u2019re procedurally generated \u2014 only to die and use what you\u2019ve learned and collected to get a little farther the next time. This loop is at the core of what makes progressing through Dead Cells so special. Each new zone you reveal, each new artifact or weapon or skill you uncover, it all spurs that bittersweet, rewarding sense you\u2019re slowly peeling away Dead Cells great mystery. Each small bit of persistent power you pick up propels you forward like a bloody snowball careening down a mountain until you feel unstoppable. \u201c The placement and order of its levels are Dead Cells\u2019 skeletal frame, but the ever-changing layouts and enemy and item placements are the blood that pumps through its heart. It\u2019s what makes every run different enough to be consistently tense and surprising and what challenges the notion you\u2019ve seen it all when you\u2019re dozens of runs through. You simply don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to find, because it could be anything from a huge pool of equipment that\u2019s delivered with perfect pacing. And just when I thought I\u2019d dredged the best from that pool, in the very next run a shiny new toy would drop with glittering fanfare and I\u2019d race to bank it with The Collector. And though it may sting when you have to say goodbye to those perfect turrets that helped you progress further than ever before \u2014 the ones that set victims ablaze and do double damage to burning enemies in tandem \u2014 or the tens of thousands of gold you\u2019ve collected on a particularly bountiful run, the actual progression comes from unlocking buffs, skills, and weapons between each run that never go away \u2014 no matter how often you thrust your face into walls of spikes while trying to set a new land speed record in the Ancient Sewers. But through that constant repetition, like being trapped in some kind of gothic-horror Groundhog\u2019s Day, you\u2019ll scrape together money, blueprints for new items, and Cells you can spend to unlock blueprints and buffs for future use. Each small bit of persistent power you pick up propels you forward like a bloody snowball careening down a mountain until you feel unstoppable. Speed Demon Momentum is where Dead Cells really shines. Its slick system of running, jumping, dodging, and pounding through these dungeons feels so good that the desire to move and attack quickly overrides a lot of the caution that comes with a game where death sends you back to the beginning. If you\u2019re wily enough, move fast enough, or jump precisely enough, you\u2019re untouchable. \u201c Motion Twin\u2019s subtle design pushes you forward through ingenious touches. You\u2019re rewarded for multi-kills with a burst of movement speed to keep propelling you forward. You don\u2019t take damage from colliding with enemies, only their attacks inflict harm, and that grants a sense of safety even in the presence of the diverse and deadly foes. If you\u2019re wily enough, move fast enough, or jump precisely enough, you\u2019re untouchable. Though it should be noted that this kind of blazing speed is where I\u2019ve seen occasional frame rate dips across every platform, frequently in the midst of a half-dozen enemies, and most frequently on the Nintendo Switch. But this is an issue that, while annoying, never made me feel like I was incapable of conquering the island. Dead Cells\u2019 movement and combat encourages you to put it all on the line to get a little farther. It\u2019s meant to be replayed dozens of times, unlocking another small but significant fragment of the broad skillset with each new artifact you earn. Once you\u2019ve unlocked all of the clever Metroid-style abilities you\u2019re eventually able to move unrestricted through Dead Cells\u2019 darkest recesses to uncover its skimpy, but fun, bits of story and cleverly hidden game references in secret areas. There\u2019s a genuine sense that the secrets hiding near the end of Dead Cells\u2019 journey are as potent as those you\u2019re able to unlock near the start. Finding a rune in the acidic pits of the Toxic Sewers changed my first 15 minutes of every run thereafter. I now had access to hefty portion of new equipment, secret areas, and alternate routes that were once unreachable. There was almost a rush in dying because it meant I could dive back into the opening minutes to uncover something I previously couldn\u2019t. That feeling carries over with each new artifact, and especially after discovering what\u2019s on the other side of the final boss. Improv, Improve The real diversity in each run comes from an excellent set of choices in how you want the second-to-second gameplay to work. Perhaps you\u2019ll blitzkrieg through with speed and fire and sword \u2014 you\u2019ll be rewarded for your reckless pace with access to timed locking gates that only open if you reach them in their stingily allotted times. Or maybe you\u2019ll go through Dead Cells methodically, using ranged weapons, traps, and turrets to safely pierce, poison, burn, or butcher enemies and thoroughly explore every inch of each level for treasure. You\u2019ll be stronger for it. I love that in Dead Cells you are free to experiment, but you don\u2019t quite know how it will all shake out. It keeps you improvising. \u201c These playstyles are changeable on the fly, too, thanks to Dead Cells\u2019 smart system for powering up throughout a run by collecting Scrolls of Power. In the beginning, you\u2019re weak, and fragile, but as you collect these scrolls you\u2019ll be able to choose a build based on your style and items. The catch is that building an aspect buffs its associated weapons and skills and it\u2019s also how you increase your maximum health pool. The more scrolls you dump into a specific aspect, the less overall health you get for each consecutive one, so if you want to play a headless beefcake capable of taking a blow, it\u2019s wise to spread your points out. However, doing so means you\u2019re not particularly powerful with any one set of items, so your damage likely won\u2019t be enough to whittle down the ever-inflating enemies in the later levels. I love that in Dead Cells you are free to experiment, but you don\u2019t quite know how it will all shake out. Your starting weapons, the items you pick up, and their modifiers are always different. It keeps you improvising. After all of the experimenting, the one overarching strategy I discovered was that you can\u2019t always go for the throat. My first 10 runs in Dead Cells were all aimed directly at the final boss, but I quickly realized spending over an hour to get there only to immediately die because I hadn\u2019t properly prepared was a waste of effort. My revised strategy was to focus on extracting blueprints for new gear in some runs, and on harvesting Cells to unlock those items and buffs in others. And every once in a while I\u2019d just run like a madman with a deathwish and explore as much as possible. For a more dramatic change of pace, there\u2019s a daily dungeon outside of your main campaign that tosses you into a random map with random pickups to see how fast you can kill the boss. And, like all things in Dead Cells, this mode also rewards permanent progression (in the form of blueprints) for consecutively clearing these challenges each day. It\u2019s a fun distraction and gives you the chance to test out gear you\u2019ve yet to find in your game.

        "Content": "Tekken 7 is a love letter to this long-running franchise and its staggering complexity. Yet somehow it still manages to be accessible to just about anyone wanting to mash buttons, and its huge amount of customization unlocks constantly give you something to strive for beyond its silly and slightly cliched story. In a pretty good time for fighting games, with Injustice 2 knocking it out of the park, Killer Instinct continuing to give us quality content years after its release, Street Fighter 5 hitting its stride after a rocky start, and a new version of Guilty Gear Xrd air-dashing our way, the King of the Iron Fist Tournament will not be outdone. On the surface, Tekken 7 is familiar, taking place on the series\u2019 signature three-dimensional stages which allow you to move to your opponent\u2019s sides as well as forward and back. Attacks are inspired by Asian martial arts and other fighting styles from around the world, placing most of the emphasis on strikes and very little on the projectiles you typically find in other fighting games. Movement is more deliberate, and carelessly jumping or dashing can be disastrous. The introduction to Tekken 7\u2019s pace comes from The Mishima Saga, the ambitious new story mode created for the console and PC versions (as opposed to the arcade). The Mishima Saga explores the healthy and emotionally stable relationships within the Mishima clan, where sons are obsessed with murdering their fathers and fathers can\u2019t help but throw their sons into the nearest lava pit. Heihachi, his son Kazuya, and his grandson Jin all maneuver trillion-dollar corporations with militaries more advanced than most industrialized nations while trying to take each other out. While The Mashima Saga does attempt to portray Heihachi in an understanding light by giving motivation for his infamously chucking Kazuya into an erupting volcano decades ago, it is hard to find sympathy for any of the scions of the Mishima family. There is a certain charm to the entirely over-the-top nature of Tekken\u2019s lore. \u201c However, there is a certain charm to the entirely over-the-top nature of Tekken\u2019s lore and its embracing of anime tropes, and the short character-specific chapters included in The Mishima Saga help lighten the mood while also serving up nostalgia. When King battles Jack, Jack uses its artificial intelligence to adapt to King\u2019s fighting style, so the famous luchador uses maneuvers borrowed from his long-time friend Marduk and from his rival Armor King. When Yoshimitsu attempts to infiltrate the Mishima Dojo, he finds Leo and battles the young girl before having a change of heart and catching a knee in the groin for his troubles. While it certainly isn\u2019t sophisticated, I feel no shame admitting watching Yoshimitsu crumple to the ground had me chuckling while smiling and shaking my head.  The Mishima Saga takes an approach similar to the story mode in Injustice 2, changing points of view between Heihachi and his progeny, Tekken Force rebel Lars, and special guest Akuma - yes, that Akuma. I found this approach to the story slightly frustrating in Injustice 2, as being thrust suddenly into the boots of a new character meant I had to stop to learn them, and the same could be said of Tekken 7 and The Mishima Saga. However, Tekken 7 does offer the ability to use simplified inputs while playing The Mishima Saga to perform a handful of pre-selected attacks, easing the transition into playing a character with whom you might not be familiar. Also, while there are multiple points of view, there is a manageable number, so I didn\u2019t need to spend a huge amount of time learning moves in order to progress. At the same time, The Mishima Saga\u2019s short, three-hour duration and slimmer cast made the events of the story feel important only to the Mishima clan itself, rather than all the fighters in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. Other fighters are given a brief time in the spotlight with optional side missions contained within Mashima Saga mode. While I found some of these, such as Yoshimitsu\u2019s ill-fated excursion into the Mashima Dojo, entertaining, I was slightly disappointed to see so little focus on anyone other than Heihachi, Jin, and Kazuya and their struggle for power over the Mishima Zaibatsu and one another. Tekken 7's customization options set a new standard. \u201c Where Tekken 7\u2019s content does not disappoint at all is in its character customization options, which put it truly in a class unto itself and sets the new standard for letting you express yourself. Cosmetics are modifiable on an unparalleled level, going beyond thousands of individual fashion pieces to include attack effects, colorful auras, portraits and tile backgrounds, and multiple alternate costumes whose top and bottom pieces can be mixed and matched. You\u2019re even allowed to choose from hundreds of options for the frame art around your health bar; it\u2019s something so simple, yet it adds another cool way to make yourself unique when playing online.  Extra content is unlocked by completing matches in online Tournaments, Treasure Battle, or by spending Fight Money, which you earn simply by playing. The sheer amount of content in character appearance alone would give a completionist a hell of a lot of fights to finish in order to collect all the hats, shirts, accessories, costumes, and alternate artwork. Hwoarang starting up the Superkick Party in a Bullet Club t-shirt? Too sweet. These alternate looks partner up with an often-overlooked element to the Tekken characters, which Tekken 7 delivers: even old faces look new, rather than sticking to the tried-and-true costumes and designs from previous games. Hwoarang has an eye patch. Lars wears new armor. Heihachi sports a samurai-inspired look. King looks heroic in a cape. While characters like Street Fighter\u2019s Ryu and Sagat, King of Fighter\u2019s Iori, or Guilty Gear\u2019s Slayer and Sol have classic, iconic looks, I appreciate that Tekken takes a chance by reimagining the visual design for even their most veteran names. When I see Yoshimitsu wearing armor that looks like it was designed by H.R. Giger, I know I\u2019m playing Tekken 7. Tweaks have been made to encourage newbies. \u201c Underneath the excellent cosmetics, some tweaks have been made to the combat mechanics that should encourage newbies. (If you\u2019re a newbie you might not understand this \u2013 but that\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t need to benefit from these changes). Relative to the phenomenal Tekken 6, sidestepping here is slower and not as useful for baits or defense, while forward and back movement is improved. This places more emphasis on short and middle ranges, which feels more comfortable for those approaching Tekken from experience with spacing-focused games in Street Fighter or King of Fighters. While sidestepping is slightly less useful and no longer a universal weapon against certain characters who lack strong tracking attacks, careful and expert usage can still open up opportunities to capitalize on mistakes. It also helps characters with traditionally slower sidesteps like King or Paul to not feel so disadvantaged in defense.  New damage scaling has reduced the amount of damage longer combos do, with launcher damage down from Tekken 6 and total damage dropping sharply from the fourth hit of a juggle onward. However, continuing to practice combo execution is a must, as wall-carry combos are still crucial even if they aren\u2019t doing as much damage. The changes are slightly more forgiving for the newer faces among us who might throw out a poke only to whiff and find themselves getting severely punished. The movement and damage changes are a smart way to encourage people to learn Tekken 7 without sacrificing the complexity that is the series\u2019 trademark. Tekken 7 is the best the series has ever been. \u201c Rest assured that this is still, pound for pound, the most technical fighting game on the planet. While the combo system has been changed to be more streamlined by replacing traditional Bound bounces from previous versions with Screw Attacks, there is still ample opportunity to get lost exploring the artful flow of each match. Scaling changes mean most of a combo\u2019s damage is front-loaded, forcing difficult choices. Do I punish with a down-forward 2-leading into a longer combo which will carry me closer to the wall, or do I get in some damage with a shorter combo off an up forward 3? I found optimizing my performance to be a near-zen exercise of evaluating conditions, making changes and choices in mere moments accommodating distance, scaling, positioning, health, and even the stages themselves. No other fighting games master imparting a feeling of each fight growing organically, living and breathing like Tekken, and Tekken 7 is the best the series has ever been. Perhaps most admirable of all, despite the ultra-demanding execution required to master Electric Wind Godfists or to visually recognize frame advantage and know the difference between a 12-frame and 14-frame punish, Tekken 7 still manages to be something you can pick up, press buttons, and play. No matter who you are or what your skill level, you can always just pick ole\u2019 Eddie and start tapping away at the kick buttons. It\u2019s the push to take your skills to the next level that requires you to immerse yourself in Tekken 7\u2019s intricacies. 139 Images  The action goes down with a soundtrack of drum-and-bass bangers so awesome it left me disappointed when I fired up Spotify and came up empty-handed after a hopeful search. The main menu theme, \u201cSolitude,\u201d sets the mood from the moment you fire up Tekken 7.  \u201cEmpty Your Mind\u201d from the Dragon\u2019s Nest stage, \u201cMetallic Experience\u201d from the Mishima Building stage, and heck, even \u201cThe Motion\u201d from the Warm-Up Space had me nodding my head along with the beats and beatdowns. Quality music would be enough, but Tekken 7 takes it an impressive step further by including the soundtracks to every single Tekken ever released (including both Tekken Tag Tournaments) and allowing you to substitute in any of your favorites or to create a custom playlist of your favorite songs from old Tekkens and the new one. Including all the Tekken music is a cool touch and marks a reoccurring theme within Tekken 7 of celebrating Tekken as a whole. [Note: this Jukebox Mode is a PlayStation 4-exclusive feature.] You can use your Fight Money to purchase marketing and concept pieces, original art, and all the video cutscenes for every Tekken. This is a nostalgia motherlode, and viewing some of this material quickly pulled me back in time to memories of years spent with Tekken, whether hours of matches of Tekken 3 with friends in high school, countless quarters sank into Tekken Tag Tournament machines, or getting destroyed repeatedly by the Bay Area Tekken scene when other Street Fighter players and I tried to transition into Tekken 6. Online multiplayer between strong connections has been smooth with minimal frame delay, though we've seen some weaker connections drop during matchmaking. On a whim, I accepted matches on mid-ranged connections with players from Asia and was pleasantly surprised to find that, while latency was not as low or steady as more local matches, the fights were still enjoyable. Certain characters do require unforgiving execution within a short window of frames, such as the Mishimas with their infamous Electric Wind Godfist, but Tekken 7 helpfully allow you to practice in Training mode while simulating the delay you would expect at various connection strengths."

        "Content": "Update: Forza Horizon 3 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .  The term we use in Australia for what Americans call doing doughnuts is \u201ccircle work.\u201d Right now I\u2019m doing some spectacular circle work around an outback airstrip in a custom V8 ute with all the trimmings. I\u2019m talking high-powered spotlights, a CB antenna sticking proudly up into the air, and a giant, mesh-filled roo bar that looks like it\u2019s fallen off the front of a Kenworth. \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019 is banging on my stereo and the tacho needle is banging on the redline. This is Forza Horizon 3 for me; an experience that could only get more Australian if it was delivered inside a giant jar of Vegemite by Paul Hogan crashing into your living room riding an actual crocodile. But maybe that\u2019s not your bag. You may prefer classic American muscle, or perhaps you\u2019re more partial to Japanese tuners from the turn of the century, or maybe you haven\u2019t got time for anything but European hypercars. That\u2019s okay too, because the Forza franchise is famous for its wonderfully eclectic approach to car curation and Forza Horizon 3 is no exception; it\u2019s still the best in the business. The big difference here is that with its new level of car customisation and personalisation, an incredibly malleable career experience that can be played solo or co-op with friends, and even baked-in support for a soundtrack of your own choosing, Horizon 3 can be bent to your desires like never before in the series. Combined with dazzling landscapes and lighting effects, outstanding sound design, and well-honed driving dynamics, the results are absolutely fantastic. Great Southern Land The standard for this series is very high. Back in 2014 Forza Horizon 2 delivered us a sumptuous slab of Mediterranean coastline; a splendid, summertime jaunt through the rolling fields and quaint seaside towns of southern Europe that felt like it was lifted from an episode of Top Gear. It\u2019s lovely, truly. And Horizon 3\u2019s world just crushes it. The cars may be the stars here, but it\u2019s the stage that steals the show. The cars may be the stars here, but it\u2019s the stage that steals the show. \u201c There isn\u2019t any one reason, but many that add up. The attention to detail, for example, is magnificent, and as an Australian it\u2019s certainly something I can wholly vouch for. The road markings, the street signs, even the garbage bins with their multi-coloured lids. It\u2019s eerie, really. The lighting is astonishing, too, with the amazingly authentic sky bathing the whole environment in uncannily realistic sunlight and casting crisper shadows. (The latter are at their most superb as you wind through the thick rainforest sections as the sun tries to pierce through the tall trees.) Water plays a big part, too, and not just because the entire place looks even better slick from rain. Everything from the gently sloshing waves by the Twelve Apostles to the wake created by your wheels as you putter across shallow streams is top notch. Its greatest strength is probably the sheer variety of landscapes, though. Horizon 3 remains dwarfed by the likes of The Crew \u2019s impressively large map, but it packs a pile of vastly different terrains into its Australian backdrop. There\u2019s a quiet coastal town, with its picturesque beaches, and the rolling fields between it and the high-rise, urban metropolis of Surfers Paradise. There\u2019s the damp and dense rainforest carpeted with thick undergrowth around closely packed trees. There\u2019s also rural wine country that gives way to the sparse red dust and isolated farms of the outback. If anything, Horizon 3\u2019s outback zone isn\u2019t really big enough to communicate the sheer vastness of the real thing that I\u2019d yearned for (shelve your hopes of any arrow-straight highways disappearing over the, er, horizon) but it\u2019s nonetheless a noticeable improvement over Horizon 2 where all four corners of the map felt largely similar to each other. Bush bashing. The lighting certainly helps a great deal, though, as the differences between each area are also heightened by Horizon 3\u2019s new global illumination lighting system. It gives the outback a different hue to, say, the rainforest zone as the light picks up an orange tint from the sunburnt soil. The whole environment looks extra special in the pitch black of night, too, with the red glow of the roadside reflectors and the glint of approaching signs responding to your car\u2019s headlights. Global illumination also does wonders for the car models, seating them in the world better than ever. It\u2019s perhaps telling that despite the fact I\u2019m a dyed-in-the-wool cabin view enthusiast I\u2019m finding myself more and more regularly opting to cruise with the chase cam to marvel at the way the cars gleam and pick up realistic reflections, even of the clouds above. Cabin view, however, is the best seat in the house from which to behold Horizon 3\u2019s wet weather. It\u2019s improved markedly from Horizon 2, with droplets now streaking across the glass and being shoved around by the wipers, as seen in last year\u2019s Forza Motorsport 6 . The price for all this eye candy on Xbox One is that Horizon 3 runs at 30 frames per second (as with previous Horizon games) although it remains locked there always, providing a smooth and consistent driving experience. The only time I ever saw it stumble was during the vignettes you get upon discovering a barn find (which are back, more plentiful than ever, and better disguised on the menu screens prior to their discovery). The PC version is blissfully unrestricted. It's better down where it's wetter. Another area of improvement is the spectacular audio; Horizon 3 is the best-sounding Forza game to date \u2013 including Forza Motorsport. The step up from Horizon 2 is immediately noticeable, and that\u2019s already a great-sounding game, but there\u2019s just something about the exhaust notes here in Horizon 3 that seem louder and more aggressive than ever before. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of feathering the throttle with the backfire that Horizon 3 provides; it\u2019s like the crack of a rifle. Horizon 2\u2019s brand of simple and seamless opt in/opt out multiplayer returns and now includes include new co-op functionality, so if you don\u2019t want to play the career mode alone you can join three friends and tackle it in co-op. Everything you discover and complete is consistent across multiplayer and solo play, which is great design. Kick It in the Guts, Barry Beyond its prowess when it comes to presentation, Horizon 3\u2019s big bullet point is its pliability. There are more car customisation options than ever, and the best ones are sorted into a separate menu, so it\u2019s clear before purchasing which rides will feature the new widebody kits and blower options. 2015\u2019s Need for Speed actually made up a lot of ground on the Forza franchise\u2019s level of customisation (even surpassing it in some areas, like the ability to place decals on glass, for instance) but Horizon 3 is a confident response to the challenge. Just Stance 2016. We\u2019re also no longer restricted to a default avatar; rather we can now choose from a selection, \u00e0 la Test Drive Unlimited. Playground has even had its voice actors record a host of names the commentary will refer to you by, which is a cute touch. It defaulted to Luke, but I chose \u2018Sausage\u2019 because I\u2019m clearly easily amused. Every time I load my game I hear Anna, my GPS assistant, say, \u201cWelcome back, Sausage!\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to drive away with a grin after that greeting. You\u2019re no longer restricted to the in-game music, either, and I really can\u2019t stress enough how much I love the Groove Music integration here. It really is surprisingly easy to play your own music in Horizon 3 and it\u2019s absolutely worth a try if you love driving to particular tunes. While I mentioned \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019 in the intro, Horizon 3 contains no AC/DC; I\u2019m just playing my own. Having the built-in ability to stream your music itself is different to just playing background music via the Groove app on your Xbox One, too. Done in-game it\u2019ll play just like any of the included radio stations; there\u2019s no DJ but your songs will get the full post-processing treatment any time you drive into a festival location so it\u2019ll sound like your radio has just given way to a live concert. That said, my personal songs would occasionally hang and skip like a badly scratched CD, but I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s a bandwidth issue on my part or a technical one with the functionality itself. Hey there, Blimpy Boy. But it\u2019s the flexibility of the racing events themselves that gives us almost complete control over how Horizon 3 unfolds. Horizon 2 allowed us to rock up to a new championship and completely ignore the suggested car class, which meant we could progress towards the festival\u2019s grand finale without ever leaving the cars we wanted to drive most. Horizon 3 goes a step further, not only by adjusting certain events automatically depending on what car you\u2019ve brought to the start point but also by allowing us to either completely re-script the event from the ground up ourselves, or race a custom event created by friends or other Horizon 3 players. The functionality is dubbed Horizon Blueprint and lets us select the time of day, the weather, the competition, and even the name of the race itself. It\u2019s brilliant, and means every event can be raced in dozens and dozens of different ways under a whole range of conditions. Completing your own or your friends\u2019 Blueprint events will net you the same rewards you\u2019d earn for opting for the \u201cofficial\u201d events Playground has baked in. You can even create your own Bucket List challenges \u2013 the one-off, themed events introduced in Horizon 2 \u2013 starting at predetermined points in the world. About my only gripe here is that the Horizon 3 still isn\u2019t nuanced enough to distinguish between Ford vehicles from the US, the UK, and Australia. As a result Horizon 3\u2019s Australian-themed race category \u2018Aussie Rules\u2019 is kind of a waste of space right now, considering Aussie Fords remain sorted as US cars and aren\u2019t eligible. An odd miss considering how utterly reverent Horizon 3 otherwise is to its setting."

        "Content": "If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling, feverish descent directly into it. It\u2019s a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world that\u2019s enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges.  Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet.   The Kingdom of Lothric and the lands that lie beyond contain some of the most visually striking places developer From Software has ever crafted. Even though many of its locations do recycle ideas from familiar locales (like the Catacombs and yet another poison swamp), they're distinguished well enough to feel distinct from their past game parallels. There was never a moment when I didn\u2019t feel captivated by their strong sense of place and the amount of gorgeous detail put into each environment. I stared out in awe atop the crumbling medieval stronghold of the High Wall, taking in the view of its surrounding valleys and snow-capped mountains, while all around me the fort\u2019s frenzied denizens turned to stone and wood mid-prayer. I trudged through the poison swamps of the Road of Sacrifices while battling seething, cross-bearing beasts, braved Irithyll\u2019s chilling, Tower of Latria-like dungeon, and got lost in a multi-story maze of curse-ridden bookshelves in the Grand Archives.  Dark Souls 3\u2019s world does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. \u201c Every level is not only full of breathtaking architectural marvels and the most minute environmental embellishments, but also dense with things to do and see from moment to moment. But those views are more intense than Dark Souls 3 can handle \u2013 dramatic framerate dips (which we saw even on an ultra-high-end PC with two GeForce GTX Titan Zs) caused a lot of these fantastic looking areas to drag along, sometimes down to 20 to 25 FPS. But the rest of the time, when it is running at a smooth 60 (on PC only), Dark Souls 3 is a sight to see.   Exploration of the aforementioned places is the cornerstone of this series, and Dark Souls 3\u2019s world does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. You could spend hours in a single area, diligently investigating every dark corner or side road, and be consistently rewarded with some interesting story revelation, new gear, mini bosses, and even entire secret areas. Illusory walls make a triumphant return, driving me to compulsively slash away at suspicious-looking dents or bricks in search of precious equipment. I got a pretty high rate of return on doing that, too, from the earliest levels to the very late game. Crystal lizards also must have had a breeding season, because there are a ton of them slithering around, ripe for the slaying and with lots of twinkling titanite for leveling up special weapons.  A mostly triumphant return to the kind of large-scale, world-focused journey of Dark Souls 1. \u201c Dark Souls 3\u2019s world isn\u2019t as openly interconnected as that of Dark Souls 1 (where you can freely move between high and low-level areas), but individual areas still weave their own branching paths together seamlessly, creating twisting mazes of overlapping passages and shortcuts that were a joy to lose myself in. Perhaps it\u2019s because of this lack of interconnectivity that Dark Souls 3 feels larger than the first game. Early and late-game levels don\u2019t directly connect as often, so the more you progress linearly from level to level, the farther it seems like you\u2019ve journeyed.  Your progress is marked by massive landmarks, which lend the world a cohesive quality. In several early levels, I could maintain sight of the High Wall from which I\u2019d originally come; while trying to extinguish a series of beacons as part of the entry process for a boss, I scaled a huge ladder through the thick canopy of trees blocking my view and could see clearly where I was in relation to the first level. I recalled seeing nearly this exact place too, from another spot on the High Wall.   This solid sense of space and geography elevates Dark Souls 3\u2019s level design beyond the relatively weak blueprint of Dark Souls 2, making a mostly triumphant return to the kind of large-scale, world-focused journey of Dark Souls 1. Perhaps the only things sadly missing from Dark Souls 3\u2019s environments are the kind of interesting platforming challenges present in places like Dark Souls 1\u2019s Sen\u2019s Fortress or Crystal Cave.  Kindling Friendships  There are plenty of interesting characters to meet throughout Dark Souls 3, some new and some returning. The voice acting is great as always and characters have a ton of dialogue to exhaust, offering up plenty of new emotes to perform, dropping useful hints about the world and your role in it, and generally cementing themselves as the next in a line of odd, yet lovable Souls personalities. Like in past games, NPC questlines remain mysteries to be solved over the long term of your adventure, so in my first 35-hour playthrough they weren\u2019t all completed. I let a couple characters die because of my failure to encounter them in certain areas or meet certain circumstances, but in keeping with true Dark Souls fashion, even death has its rewards: those conclusions still had something interesting to offer in the way of tragic closure, sometimes tied to other plot details in startling ways, or neat new items.   I look forward to following these questlines more closely in future playthroughs, but I worry that a few bugs I ran into in my first one might impede that. Early on, one particularly sneaky character appeared to ask me for forgiveness for a past misdeed, but it was my first time meeting him in Dark Souls 3. I later found out that he was supposed to show up at a certain spot much earlier, but he must\u2019ve missed his cue. Another character who showed up after I\u2019d spoken to a covenant leader swore the two of us were enemies from then on, even though I had never met her prior to that. I wasn\u2019t even part of the covenant \u2013 even though joining any one of Dark Souls 3\u2019s eight covenants is now as convenient as snapping a badge in place in your inventory, I hadn\u2019t done that here. But I suppose for this disgruntled NPC, just talking to the leader is good enough.  The Art of the Kill  The brutality of Dark Souls 3\u2019s worlds and the beasts that roam there are matched only by its vicious new moves called weapon arts, which add variety and style to an already strong combat system: one moment I\u2019m crushing enemies with the devastating weight of my greatsword, the next I\u2019m turning the giant hunk of curved steel into a graceful propeller of destruction.  Dark Souls 3\u2019s weapons are aggressive and multipurpose. \u201c Executing these skills use up focus points (FP), the newly added blue bar below your HP and above your stamina that also acts as mana for casting spells and pyromancies. When your FP runs out, some weapon arts, like the aforementioned greatsword propeller (Exiled Greatsword \u2013 seriously, use it), start costing stamina instead \u2013 a sensible and acceptable trade-off. Certain other skills, like a lightning spear that lets you charge at enemies with an electrifying blast, let you complete the move without the elemental damage until you recover FP, so running out of FP isn\u2019t necessarily urgent or mood-killing. It becomes far more important when you\u2019re a spellcaster, because the amount of spell charges you have depends on FP, but the system is actually more generous than it is limiting. That\u2019s because of a new reusable item called Ashen Estus.   Besides resting at a bonfire, the primary way of recovering FP is Ashen Estus. You can easily allot a number of uses for these blue flasks by speaking with the blacksmith in the hub world. If you have a maximum of 10 flasks (increased by giving Estus Shards found in the world to the blacksmith), then you can designate five for healing Estus and five for Ashen Estus, a decision which can be changed anytime you want. Having a way to recharge FP on the go means more freedom to use spells and pyromancies, which means more opportunity to play dependently on magic \u2013 great news for spellcasters.  Weird and Wonderful Weapons  Some of the most awesome-looking weapon arts, and one of the most impressive strides in Dark Souls 3\u2019s combat in general, come out of its dual-wielded weapon sets. A clean system for dual-wielding most combinations of weapons and an awesome arsenal designed specifically for it means it\u2019s now actually viable to have a dual-wielding build in Dark Souls. The risk of not having a shield has always been one part of what\u2019s so enticing about dual-wielding, and some of Dark Souls 3\u2019s weapons are just aggressive and multipurpose enough to make you not even miss it.   One greatsword and dagger combo in particular lets you perform several wide, sweeping slashes, driving groups of enemies back before delivering a final, mid-air blow. You can also quickly lock onto new enemies mid-chain, prioritizing dangerous or vulnerable individuals in a mob to maximize the effect of your attacks. I unleashed this attack to deal with situations where a group of smaller enemies surrounded a larger and more dangerous leader, slashing away at the minions before executing the last heavy blow on the main enemy in the middle.  Dark Souls 3\u2019s roster of relentless horrors hit harder and sometimes faster than ever. \u201c Weapon arts also make shields more fun to use by giving them more variety. Some shields lack the parry ability, using the same command to instead quickly perform your right-hand weapon\u2019s skill without the need to manually two-hand it. Some shields are capable of shield-bashing attacks, too \u2013 yes, this means you can dual-wield greatshields. In fact, you can dual-wield just about any combination of weapon with complete right and left-handed movesets, which makes the opportunities for awesome and bizarre builds seem nearly endless. That\u2019s not even counting boss weapons, which come with unique weapon skills that, paired with Dark Souls 3\u2019s fantastic collection of new and returning armor sets, allow you to not just look like your favorite characters and bosses, but perform their signature attacks as well.   Boss weapons are extremely easy to craft, too \u2013 a character in the hub world trades them for souls (boss soul included) after being given an item you receive relatively early on. One boss soul can yield multiple weapons and even spells or rings, so collecting them all encourages multiple playthroughs. It also makes the choice of what to actually craft a little harder and even nerve-wracking: after creating a silly sounding pyromancy from a Stray Demon soul, I was saddened to learn I\u2019d somehow skipped over Havel\u2019s Ring, which once again increases your equip load \u2013 vital for heavy armor and weapon users who want to maintain that quick roll. Let my mistake be your warning: choose your boss gear wisely! (And for the love of Havel, get that guy\u2019s ring.)  The titanite used to upgrade weapons is extremely plentiful in Dark Souls 3. \u201c Having access to a versatile arsenal of destruction is handy, because Dark Souls 3\u2019s roster of relentless horrors hit harder and sometimes faster than ever. AI invaders, special characters who appear in specific areas to do battle, make a valiant return, fighting with the speed and aggression of a skilled PvPer. Relative to past Souls games, enemies here are also unusually crowded and agile. This added a new but welcome layer of challenge as well as some great opportunities to make the most of my weapon arts. I found myself approaching combat situations with even more caution and planning than Dark Souls usually requires.  On top of the usual strategies \u2013 hiding behind a shield, aggroing one enemy at a time with the now-pleasingly quick Short Bow, going in for the backstab to cut a battle short \u2013 I also spent more time observing the environment and making sure I knew my exits. In more than one instance, a relentless line of shield-bashing, weapon art-using knights had me making a beeline straight for the next bonfire before attempting to deal with them. I also kept several types of weapons reinforced for dealing with all kinds of situations. The titanite used to upgrade weapons is extremely plentiful in Dark Souls 3, so no farming is necessary to keep those handy options ready.  Lords of Cinder  Dark Souls 3 experiments a lot more with the boss-battle structure, yielding mixed results. For example, most boss fights have two phases, in much the same way Bloodborne does, which means new movesets and sometimes a brand-new health bar can emerge halfway through a battle to keep the tension mounting and prevent you from getting lazy with your tactics.  Most of the bosses are a fun challenge. \u201c While most boss fights are traditional, Dark Souls-style battles of slashes, shields, and rolls, some bosses have well-placed weak spots that must be targeted to deal damage, or require a bit more puzzling to take down. This occasional experimental approach to bosses was always interesting in concept, but more often than not resulted in underwhelming or anticlimactic fights. Taking down a hulking giant in four hits is a waste of an awesome boss design, even if the method is pretty cool \u2013 and once you know how to do it, that boss is never really threatening again.   It isn\u2019t like Dark Souls 3 has a shortage of awesome boss designs, though \u2013 ranging from majestic to frightful, some even made me gasp in shock over the lore implications of their look, or music, or circumstances, and most did have an exciting and tough battle to match. Those framerate dips made an unwelcome return during some of these fights, however, rendering all the excitement occasionally hard to look at.  But most of the bosses are a fun challenge for good reasons, and some of those battles made me feel outmatched enough that I was compelled to use another of Dark Souls 3\u2019s new mechanics. Embers, the Dark Souls 3 equivalent of Dark Souls 1\u2019s Humanity, elevate you from Unkindled to Kindled form, which gives you access to online features and adds a cool, burning effect to your armor. Similar to Demon\u2019s Souls\u2019 Body/Soul Form system, being Kindled also grants a boost in HP that is lost on death, but the extra HP is more of a reward for being Kindled (which is automatic when you defeat a boss) than a penalty for being Unkindled. The HP boost was nice insurance to have during a particularly tough boss, but not necessary for all of them.   The real value of Embers is their requirement to use online features. I defeated all the bosses solo on my first playthrough, but a few test runs with co-op and password matchmaking proved that jumping into fights with friends is quick, easy, and fun, so you\u2019ll want to have those Embers ready for multiplayer. I never ran out of Embers during my playthrough and even if I did, a few enemies drop them and some merchants at the hub sell a limited number."

Of Good Character  The best thing about Revelation is how it brings together the casts of both Birthright and Conquest. That\u2019s exciting for three reasons. First, there\u2019s unique and enjoyable character dialogue not found anywhere else. Some of these encounters, like the barbed quips exchanged by the pedantic Leo of Nohr and the prickly Takumi of Hoshido, are downright hilarious. Others are genuinely sweet \u2013 my favorite moments involved Princess Sakura shyly conversing with the stoic Prince Xander. It\u2019s easy to fall in love them all \u2013 which you can actually do by pairing up constantly and attaining an S rank (the highest available) with an ally of the opposite gender. That not only unlocks steamy romantic dialogue that can cross faction lines, but will give you access to all the children produced from unions in both Conquest and Birthright, adding more useful members to your army.   Another reason to jump for joy over your more diverse cast members is that you now have more ways to build your perfect army. Each unit has specific class abilities as well as a unique personal skill, which makes learning which formerly incompatible Nohr and Hoshido abilities compliment each other a lot of fun. For example, I found great success in pairing Ryoma with Xander, since the latter can steamroll enemies through Ryoma\u2019s Bushido skill, which boots a partner\u2019s attack while decreasing enemy damage. Plus, having them fight alongside each other triggers Attack Stance and Defense Stance, combat features that let adjacent allies dual-attack and parry enemy blows respectively. It\u2019s exciting to watch these two former enemies team up to cut foes down.  Learning which Nohr and Hoshido abilities compliment each other is a lot of fun. \u201c The third and final reason to be excited over your windfall of soldiers is how it expands on the already-robust character customization. You can use special seals found in shops or looted in battle to level up a unit\u2019s base class and gain extra perks and abilities, or change their class to something better suited to your style. With soldiers from Nohr and Hoshido in your war party, there are literally dozens of ways create the best army in the world. I used Master Seals to turn my luckless Fighter Arthur into a bone-crushing Berserker, and my snotty bowman Takumi into a powerful sniper. Evolving their job classes didn\u2019t just give them extra stats and abilities, though \u2013 by using Arthur\u2019s Strength Rally skill with Takumi\u2019s Quick Draw attack, they could quickly mow down any fool who stood in their way. This made Takumi and Arthur a nice tag team to use in combat, especially after I maxed out their Support rank, which boosts stats and abilities whenever friendly units are next to each other.  A Story Not Quite Told  Revelation\u2019s climactic 30-hour story takes place mostly in the lost land of Valla, which looks like something straight out of a high-fantasy novel with its magical floating islands and crumbling ancient ruins.    The first act feels a bit weak due to a silly plot device \u201c  Unifying the two families is a fun concept with some excellent payoff towards the end, as the threads from Birthright and Conquest finally tie together to create a more cohesive whole. Unfortunately, the first act feels a bit weak due to a silly plot device involving a contrived curse and a melodramatic moment shoehorned into the story for the sake of another silly plot device. It soon recovers, though, making up for that weak start with a series of crazy plot twists at the end and genuinely moving character interactions that had me wiping away a tear or two. These special scenes are made even better by fantastic music and excellent art direction that uses sweeping angles and well-timed close-ups on characters\u2019 expressive faces to convey pain, regret, or hope as they fight to protect the world from a corrupt and ruthless being.  It should be noted that Revelation contains spoilers for both Conquest and Birthright, so you might want to finish at least one of those before starting this one. Trust me, it\u2019s worth the wait.   Join The (War) Party  The story is matched up with an outstanding campaign, which strikes a fantastic balance between Birthright straightforward objectives (route the enemy, defeat the boss) and Conquest\u2019s creative and challenging maps: in one mission you have to seize a fort while navigating a pitch-black cave where enemies lay in ambush; in another you must use special tiles on the map called Dragon Veins to change the direction of the wind in order to blow enemies away from you. There\u2019s even a cool navy battle where you\u2019ll have to leap from ship to ship in order to reach enemies. It requires a lot of strategy to conquer these maps, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s so fun about it.  There\u2019s even a cool navy battle where you\u2019ll have to leap from ship to ship \u201c Revelation is definitely a lot more challenging than Birthright, but it\u2019s still perfectly accessible to newcomers thanks to some excellent flexibility in the difficulty. Like Birthright it allows you to revisit conquered maps to toughen up your troops (against randomized enemies, which keeps it from feeling too grindy) if you feel like you\u2019ve hit an insurmountable wall. There\u2019s also a sliding difficulty setting that ranges from super easy (Phoenix Mode with permadeath turned off) to head-bangingly hard (Lunatic Mode with permadeath off) and everything in between.  It doesn\u2019t hurt to start on a lower level either, since there\u2019s a lot going on with these tactical maps. Like in previous Fire Emblems, you have to juggle a number of combat variables, including learning to defeat the type of weapons enemies use with its rock-paper-scissors-style counter, observing what their stats and buffs are, making note of whether they\u2019re paired up (a new feature that lets enemies attack and defend just as effectively as ally troops) and taking into account how close they are.   Judiciously, Fates makes it easy to manage all of this with an intuitive interface on the lower screen. Take the traditional Weapons Triangle for example: swords and tomes beat axes and bows, bows and axes trump hidden weapons and spears, and hidden weapons and spears are superior to swords and tomes. That might seem confusing to the uninitiated, but a handy color-coded schematic makes it easy to understand. Meanwhile, the Combat Forecast lets you view ally and enemy stats side by side, with buffs and debuffs clearly marked in blue and red respectively. It\u2019s a simple system that makes determining the outcome of a fight hassle-free.  Test Your Might  Revelation base-building mode is a more robust and enjoyable feature than in Birthright and Conquest, because now you can fill your fortress with charming item shops from Nohr and elegant buffer stations from Hoshido. This gives you more freedom to design your hub town however you want, which I appreciated because I liked having a place that looked uniquely my own.  65 Images  These buildings aren\u2019t just cosmetic, though. They also double as additional defense against online invaders during multiplayer. Five-on-five online battles are pretty fun, and stopping Streetpass invaders in their tracks with my mix of Hoshido and Nohr warriors and artillery felt great; bet they didn\u2019t see that one coming!  Unfortunately, Revelation is saddled with Fates\u2019 clunky online interface. A crystal ball near the throne area of your fortress organizes your multiplayer options into neat little menu tabs, but it\u2019s sometimes easy to accidentally log out entirely once you\u2019re finished flipping through them. It\u2019s a minor gripe though, and I still enjoyed using StreetPass to summon someone else\u2019s troops into battle. That in itself is a nice incentive to hop online.

It is the Skyrim to Fallout 3\u2019s Oblivion, if you will \u2013 it iterates on the previous game\u2019s already amazing systems, and it\u2019s similarly dense with locations to explore, genuinely creepy monsters to fight, and superbly engrossing post-nuclear atmosphere that blends unsettling gore and death with dark comedy. After more than 55 hours played I may have seen an ending, yet I feel like I\u2019ve only begun to explore its extraordinary world; from the look of it, I\u2019ll easily be able to spend another 100 happy hours here and still see new and exciting things. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Watch the first 20 minutes of Fallout 4 above. A story that begins as a basic search for your lost family evolves into something much more complex and morally nuanced. Like in Fallout: New Vegas, we\u2019re drawn into a struggle between several groups competing for control of the region, and deciding which of their imperfect post-apocalyptic philosophies to align with made me pause to consider how I wanted events to play out. Even the highly questionable Institute has a tempting reason to side with them, and turning away from them in my playthrough wasn\u2019t as clear-cut a choice as I\u2019d expected. I was impressed by the sympathy shown toward the villains, too - even the most irredeemable murderer is explored and given a trace of humanity. The main story isn\u2019t nearly as gripping an attraction as the huge number of well-written side quests.Of course, as is the tradition with developer Bethesda Game Studios\u2019 open-world RPGs, the main story isn\u2019t nearly as gripping an attraction as the huge number of well-written side quests you\u2019ll come across just by wandering through the ruins of the Boston area, now known as The Commonwealth. I found it difficult to complete even the most basic point-A-to-point-B task without being sidetracked at least twice by enticing detours. An abandoned comic book publisher office? How can I not explore it? Boston\u2019s famous Fenway Park? Gotta see what\u2019s become of that. A crumbling high school with heads on pikes outside? I bet there\u2019s great loot in there! Practically tripping over new discoveries like this, I feel like a kid on Easter whose parents are bad at hiding the candy. Watch a 24-hour time lapse above. Attention to detail is evident everywhere.Exploration has its own rewards, as this is the most diverse Fallout world yet, with dilapidated urban areas, ominous dead forests, eerie swamps, a desolate area mired in a hellish radioactive haze, and even some areas that look borderline hospitable like beaches and budding farms. The Commonwealth\u2019s much more color-saturated than Fallout 3\u2019s Capital Wasteland, though it has its fair share of grays and browns, and it shares New Vegas\u2019 bright blue sky (as opposed to oppressive clouds) when it\u2019s not night time or raining or green with a terrifying radiation storm. It\u2019s often beautiful. Attention to detail is evident everywhere \u2013 Fallout 4 might not be a leader in all areas of graphics technology (character animations are still a weakness) but from the intricate Pip-Boy wrist-computer interface (which completely changes when you\u2019re in power armor), to careful arrangement of skeletal remains that tell the tragically dark or tragically funny stories of long-dead characters, to tattered poster art on the walls, to even raindrops on your visor (if you\u2019re wearing one) it\u2019s consistently impressive. Perhaps because this adventure is such a long haul, Fallout 4 is  a bit overeager to hook us in the beginning. After a brief glimpse of pre-war life in Fallout\u2019s familiar-but-strange near-future and a retelling of the events on the day the bombs fell in 2077, we barely have time to get our hands dirty in the post-apocalyptic era before Fallout 4 throws us into a big action moment: You\u2019re given a suit of the big, stompy power armor and a heavy weapon, and put into an intense brawl against the series\u2019 most iconic monster. Above: Vault IGN discusses the first things we'll do in Fallout 4. It\u2019s certainly not an unconventional idea for a game with a long progression arc to give us an early taste of the powerful toys we\u2019ll gain access to later in order to motivate us to work for them, but with Fallout it\u2019s a misstep that trods on the series\u2019 beloved feeling of working our way up from almost nothing to become the dominant force in the wasteland. This bothered me less and less as I began to explore, but knowing that armor was available when I wanted it made me a little cockier than I wanted to be when setting out into a hostile, unforgiving world. The decision of what to do with the single point you get each level has a significant impact.One of the first things a returning Fallout player will notice after creating a character with the intuitive push-and-pull face-sculpting tool is that the entire concepts of skill points and traits have been consumed by the perks system, unifying all character progression under one big, elaborately animated Vault Boy chart with so many unlockable options you have to scroll through them to see them all. While this streamlining does mean giving up a lot of minute control over where your character improves with each level, it also means the decision of what to do with the single point you get each level has a significant impact, and therefore those decisions represent a commitment and are tough to make: do you want to spend it on a new low-level perk, increase the level of an existing one, or pump it into a SPECIAL attribute like Luck to boost certain stats and also open up a new, more powerful perk, like the Mysterious Stranger, that you\u2019ll be able to unlock with your next level? These might be more general, jack-of-all-trades types than previous Fallout character builds, in that you generally don\u2019t have any crippling deficiencies, but they definitely have their distinguishing features that\u2019ll make one playthrough feel different from the next. And before you lament it as a \u201cdumbing down\u201d of Fallout\u2019s overall complexity, turn your eye to the new crafting and equipment progression system, which has picked up the slack by becoming vastly more complicated and interesting. Fallout 4\u2019s crafting system gives even more motivation to compulsively collect everything that isn\u2019t nailed down.As if I didn\u2019t already have enough of a hoarding problem, Fallout 4\u2019s crafting system gives even more motivation to compulsively collect everything that isn\u2019t nailed down. It\u2019s so easy, too - grabbing things out of containers happens quickly in window that pops up when you look over it. Every item in the world is made up of material components, most of which you can intuitively guess: bottles are needed for glass, a desk fan will provide you with steel and gears, and a roll of duct tape is worth its weight in gold. I once went on a desperate search for pencils so that I could extract the lead they contained to use for radiation shielding. (Apparently Fallout's alternate universe never switched to graphite.) Nothing is worthless junk, which means that managing the weight of your inventory is a constant series of agonizing decisions of what to take with you and what to leave behind. Above: Catch up on the Fallout universe in (a little over) 5 minutes. Nearly every modification you make is reflected in the look of your gun.The value of those materials comes from their use in the fantastic equipment upgrades, which give most guns you pick up extraordinary potential for flexibility and longevity. Stopping at a crafting bench with the right components in hand can turn a pistol into a short-range, pray-and-spray automatic or a scoped sniper with a long barrel for accuracy and a big stock to reduce recoil. A few tweaks to a standard-issue laser rifle can add burning damage over time, or split the beam into a shotgun-like spread. The best part is that those changes aren\u2019t just tweaked numbers in the stats; nearly every modification you make is reflected in the look of your gun as well, creating an extremely varied selection of weapons both for you and for enemies. Likewise, the new armor system lets you piece together six chunks of gear - helmet, chest plate, and each individual arm and leg - on top of your clothes to form cobbled-together, asymmetrical outfits that feel like exactly what someone who assembled their wardrobe by scavenging the wasteland should wear. The suit my character wears now has at least one piece from each major faction, reflecting both his allegiances and his victories over foes. And of course, armor can be upgraded using collected materials as well, though it sadly doesn\u2019t have as dramatic a cosmetic effect as with weapons. The armor system suffers from some inconsistency: several times I was a little bit heartbroken to find a new outfit like a tuxedo or a Halloween costume, but couldn\u2019t use them as the foundation of a new custom-built look. Only certain jumpsuits can have pauldrons and shin guards strapped onto them, it seems, and no distinction is made in the item description. Another major change to personal protection is that Fallout\u2019s distinctive power armor behaves almost like a walking tank that you climb into and out of (with a great Iron Man-style animation as it closes around you) instead of wearing like clothes, and its fuel is a limited resource you have to find in the world. It\u2019s a bold design move that makes these hulks\u2019 appearance on the battlefield feel like a big event. However, since it\u2019s always just a fast-travel away, in practice, having to run and grab it when the going got tough became more of an inconvenience than anything - two loading screens between you and resuming the fight. It also forces you to use fast-travel to conserve fuel, which would mess with a no-fast-travel play style. But I do love how every piece of the armor can be individually damaged, repaired, upgraded, customized, or even swapped out for other models. Watch us unbox the Limited Pip-Boy Edition above. All those upgrades are a great way to keep a favorite piece of gear useful long after its original weak stats would\u2019ve led you to sell it off to a junk dealer for a handful of caps. Letting you name those items yourself is a great touch, too - I have fond memories of my adventures with my trusty long double-barrel shotgun, Ol\u2019 Shooty. I changed my playstyle to take advantage of the bonuses Legendary items offer.On top of that, loot has been punched up in a very Diablo-style way: even better than the typical spoils of battle and foraging, every so often you\u2019ll come across a Legendary enemy who will drop a uniquely named special weapon or item with a modifier. You might get a pistol that refreshes your action points when executing a critical hit, an arm piece that makes lockpicking easier, a flamethrower that deals extra radiation damage, or any of dozens of others. I found it difficult to part with these - they\u2019re so full of potential, and I found I changed my playstyle to take advantage of the bonuses they offer, and sacrificing superior protection to keep them. And of course, all of these items are just as customizable as anything else (except you can\u2019t break them down for parts). Even small changes to gun stats are important, because Fallout 4\u2019s gunplay feels more like a typical good-quality first-person shooter than the series ever has before, so skilled aim is important to the point where you could comfortably avoid the pause-and-plan Vault-Tec-Assisted Targeting System (VATS) button if you wanted to. The interface even allows you to create shortcuts on the D-pad or number keys, so you can access stimpacks and other healing or performance-enhancing drugs and items without pausing the action to go into your inventory. But I didn\u2019t want to, because planning and watching those slow-motion dismembering kills play out is still a great reward for a job well done. Above: Watch us rank the seven previous Fallout games. VATS slows time, it doesn\u2019t stop it, so bullets are still flying at you.VATS is repetitive when overused, sure, but there\u2019s still an element of danger to it: though VATS slows time, it doesn\u2019t stop it, so bullets are still flying at you even as you pick which part of your enemy you want to separate from their other parts. Additionally, a new manually activated critical-strike system and the ability to cancel out of slow-mo at any time give some much needed control over those events. Your limited action points (which are now also drained by sprinting) prevent you from really overdoing it, too. Melee combat is still disappointingly basic, though - real-time hacking and smashing now includes the ability to block and do a heavy strike (similar to Skyrim) but in VATS you aren\u2019t able to target specific body parts, which makes it useless for crippling the limbs of tough enemies. You\u2019ll find no shortage of those in Fallout 4, as the enemy types are broadly diverse. Piled on top of the expected raiders, super mutants, mole rats, mirelurks, and other returning creatures are a selection of new ones, including the terrifying blood bugs. There\u2019s something unsettling about these giant mosquitos that makes me want to keep pulling the trigger, even after they\u2019re dead, until the gun goes \u201cclick.\u201d There are more unique behaviors, too - the zombie-like feral ghouls, for instance, throw themselves at you with such ferocity they fall down and have to pick themselves up again, giving you a free shot after they\u2019ve already inflicted theirs. And radscorpions have a new trick that makes their new more-terrifying-than-ever appearance an even bigger surprise. A fully voiced male or female protagonist is a first for Fallout, but I frankly don\u2019t feel like it added much beyond the convenience of not having to read as much text when playing from the couch. It doesn\u2019t get in the way, either - performances are fine, if somewhat bland - and would only be objectionable to me if I\u2019d envisioned my character\u2019s voice as something outlandishly different. So it\u2019s successfully unobtrusive, at least. It\u2019s definitely possible to open up or close off entire quest chains through dialogue decisions and actions.How you use that voice is what counts, and though Fallout 4\u2019s quests aren\u2019t remarkably open or character-specific in how you navigate them (only a high Charisma stat opens up unique dialogue options), it\u2019s definitely possible to open up or close off entire quest chains through dialogue decisions and actions. Not every decision has far-reaching consequences, but enough do that I often paused to consider the ramifications because of some that popped up later: as a result of letting a job go south and someone getting killed, I was later confronted by a vengeful daughter. Because I\u2019d shown mercy and left a witness alive after interfering with a criminal gang\u2019s plans, they knew who to come after. On top of the big story decisions, events like those are enough to personalize a playthrough significantly. More interesting than the blank-slate main character are Fallout 4\u2019s stable of companions. These characters are shy of all-time greats, but at least a few of them are certainly memorable. The stand-out star, above even the lovably aloof robot butler Codsworth and the adorably expressive yet vicious Dog Meat, is hard-boiled detective Nick Valentine. At first he comes across as little more than a walking, talking noir cliche delivered with gusto, but he soon develops into his own man with an intriguing backstory and a case history ready to be explored. And you could just get lost in those eyes. Watch us build a sweet house above. Beyond some great contextual flavor dialogue, each companion also has their own skills, likes, and dislikes, so choosing one that complements your play style is important. For example, with Nick at your side, you won\u2019t need to invest points into lockpicking or computer hacking - he\u2019s got Expert-level skills. But if you\u2019re planning to play as a lying, cheating, thieving scoundrel, you probably won\u2019t want him or the post-apocalyptic Boy Scout, Preston Garvey, along. Things won\u2019t work out between you, and you\u2019ll see fewer side-mission opportunities arise from their dialogue. It seems that in Bethesda\u2019s drive to make settlements unintrusive to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to bother with them, it ended up making them mostly irrelevant.Building up rickety shacks, crops, water pumps, power generators, and defenses to create settlements in predefined areas with the finicky build mode interface definitely adds something to fiddle with beyond quests, but my network of towns almost never contributed meaningfully to my adventures other than somewhere to hang my vast collection of looted hats. Part of that is that their higher-level workings, and how they interact with the Leader perks in the Charisma column, aren\u2019t well explained, but it seems that in Bethesda\u2019s drive to make settlements unintrusive to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to bother with them, it ended up making them mostly irrelevant. There\u2019s potential here for crafty people to build impressive stuff, though - there\u2019s a whole tool set of switches and other items that will no doubt result in some goofy YouTube videos of elaborate contraptions. It\u2019s there to help you tell your own stories, more than anything else. On all platforms we saw occasional crashes, and every so often a side quest won\u2019t properly begin or end. Fallout 4\u2019s performance on both consoles is tolerable, but sometimes disappointing. We\u2019ve seen frequent frame rate slowdowns well below the target of 30 when simply walking around the world, and hitches of a second or more that arise mostly after loading a new save or fast-traveling. The PC version has been much smoother in that regard, running between 40 and 60fps on Ultra settings on my GeForce GTX 970, and maintaining 60 when I lowered only the anti-aliasing settings. On all platforms we saw occasional crashes (the auto-save system prevented any major loss of progress), and every so often we hit a side quest that won\u2019t properly begin or end due to scripting bugs. But at no point did I encounter anything that halted my progress, or significantly dampened my enthusiasm for exploring, fighting, looting, and just existing in this fantastic, lore-filled universe. Finally, a spoiler-free note on the ending I saw: the resulting cutscene wasn\u2019t as tailored an epilogue to my adventure as previous Fallouts have trained me to expect, which was disappointing, but Fallout 4 also doesn\u2019t make the mistake of putting a hard stop to it after the final battle \u2013 it\u2019s left open for further questing, as is the level cap. That\u2019s a trade-off. Where to Buy Fallout 4 - PS4 0 $34.99 at Amazon Fallout 4 - Xbox One 0 $22.50 at Amazon Fallout 4 - PC 0 $23.07 at Amazon"

        "Content": "PES 2016 might well be the best football game ever made.  To explain why is something of a challenge. The improvements don't lend themselves easily to snappy back-of-the-box soundbites. I can\u2019t point to a single change or addition that makes all the difference. Rather, it\u2019s a game that has been refined in dozens of small ways, all of which have a cumulatively positive effect. This year, PES has shaken off the last remnants of PS2-era rigidity, delivering a faster, more responsive and more fluid game of football. I\u2019m always a little reluctant to make direct comparisons to FIFA \u2013 not least as I\u2019ve only played the demo version of EA Sports\u2019 game \u2013 because the two handle in such distinctly different ways. For my money, while FIFA more accurately recreates the look of the sport, PES is the game that most closely captures the feel.   For starters, there\u2019s a much stronger sense of physicality this year. It\u2019s most obvious when players jostle for possession (and, indeed, for position). Before, it often felt like outcomes were binary, but it\u2019s no longer quite so predictable. Context is everything: whether you win or lose the ball in a challenge is dependent on a number of factors, taking into consideration the skill of the players involved and their position in relation to the ball and one another. A clean slide tackle is particularly satisfying: contingent on player momentum, they\u2019re among the most tangible demonstrations of your ability to read the game and your opponent. Referees are thankfully more lenient than in real life: you can barrel into a challenge at speed, cleaning out the player as well as winning the ball, but as long as you make contact, it won\u2019t automatically draw a foul. By the same token, if you repeatedly jab X while running alongside an opponent to attempt a standing tackle, rather than waiting for the right moment to step in, then you\u2019re bound to concede a free-kick.  The attacking game has been tweaked, too, and it\u2019s here you\u2019ll first notice the effort Konami has invested in individualising players. Anyone with a low centre of gravity \u2013 like Alexis Sanchez, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero \u2013 is a joy to control, as these players have the balance to skip over challenges, occasionally stumbling when clipped but always striving to stay on their feet.   There\u2019s a clear difference between these players and someone like Raheem Sterling, who has whippet-like pace, but his slight build means he\u2019s outmuscled much more easily. You might win the odd free-kick with a bit of trickery, but if you\u2019re planning to use his pace, you\u2019re better off playing the ball in behind for him to sprint onto \u2013 aim through balls too close to defenders and he\u2019ll be bundled off it all too easily. Shooting is similarly contextual, and the type of strike noticeably varies from player to player. Tevez in particular has a Howitzer of a right foot, and while you\u2019d ordinarily expect the ball to rise the longer you press the shot button, it\u2019s a joy to see him thundering a low-bouncing strike below the dive of the goalkeeper, fizzing off the surface to send the net billowing. Talking of \u2018keepers, they\u2019re more alert and reactive this time around, scrambling across their goal to palm away daisy-cutters, and getting up quickly to lunge at loose balls they\u2019ve just parried.  The idea of player personality goes well beyond the game\u2019s biggest stars. As a Manchester City fan, I naturally gravitated towards them for my first few matches; I expected to find Yaya Toure would be hard to stop when galloping at defenders, and that a typical David Silva through-ball would be a thing of measured perfection. But I was thrilled to see the tenacity of Pablo Zabaleta equally well represented, while Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s marauding runs down the left would invariably result in a cross whipped in with a palpable increase in pace from the norm. It works both ways, of course: Vincent Kompany might be imperious in the air, but his tendency to step up and try to win the ball early can be exploited by clever tactics. One opponent was able to use this to his advantage, regularly finding gaps down the channels until I made a change to tighten things up. Like last year\u2019s game, some players are clearly overpowered, but then that\u2019s true to life: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are close to unplayable, but it\u2019s up to you to find a way to deal with them, whether it\u2019s doubling-up on markers, cutting off their supply lines \u2013 or even tactical fouling.  The upshot of this is that game management is more crucial than ever. Substitutions and changes of formation can make all the difference in a tightly fought contest. Introducing a tricky winger for the last 15 minutes against a tired defence, for example, can create havoc. On one such occasion I brought Franck Ribery off the bench in a bid to torment a flagging Borussia Dortmund rearguard: in the minutes that followed, a red card and an own goal turned what had been a tight game into a rout.   The movement of your team-mates, meanwhile, is sensational \u2013 to a fault. If you\u2019ve got a full-back that likes to get forward, you\u2019ll often see them streaking down the touchline ahead of your wingers, gesturing ostentatiously to receive the ball. Give the ball away in this situation and you can end up horribly exposed. You can curb their natural instincts by tinkering with tactics, though it\u2019s not always wise to ignore a player\u2019s strengths when you can adjust the system instead.  There\u2019s never any need to remember elaborate button combinations to accomplish your goals. PES subtly simplifies everything, without ever leaving you feeling like you\u2019re not fully in control. Sometimes you might use flicks and step-overs to bamboozle an opponent; sometimes you might only need a sudden change of pace to open up space. There\u2019s a small degree of automation involved, but it\u2019s perfectly calibrated: you might not be directly responsible for the tiny hop that allows you to clear a last-ditch challenge, but you\u2019ll feel it was your own mastery that enabled you to get there in the first place. A step closer to the defender, after all, and they\u2019d surely have robbed you.  Away from the pitch, menus are much more user-friendly, with the ability to pin your favourite game types to the home screen, while Master League has undergone an interface overhaul that makes one of the medium\u2019s best career modes even more enjoyable. I\u2019m not about to list all the licences that are present and those that aren\u2019t, as you can easily find that information elsewhere; besides, it\u2019s clear that while Konami is still trying to grab as many as it can, this is one area where FIFA will always have the upper hand. That said, this year PS4 owners will be able to use option files: assuming the PES community doesn\u2019t suffer a sudden attack of lazyitis, then you should soon be able to import accurate rosters, kits, team names and more.  If Konami has found the right kind of chemistry on the pitch, it\u2019s still searching when it comes to the commentary box. The ebullient Peter Drury is a welcome replacement for Jon Champion, but he\u2019s a little too unrestrained, greeting deflected consolation goals and injury-time scissor kick winners alike with the same rhapsodic, full-throated delight. The contrast with the terminally unimpressed Jim Beglin is especially stark. With retail servers now online, I\u2019ve been able to test how PES 2016\u2019s netcode holds up, and so far it\u2019s looking very promising. I\u2019ve encountered a few instances of mild lag during games, but oddly it always seems to occur at non-crucial moments \u2013 the biggest delay I saw came when my opponent hoofed a clearance downfield. It might take a while for some to acclimatise to online play, since you\u2019re rarely afforded the same time and space on the ball, but the boost in pace and responsiveness makes for some really exciting and closely competitive online matches. Don\u2019t expect many cagey 0-0s: I\u2019ve already won *and* lost a game by the odd goal in seven. MyClub mode, meanwhile, has benefitted from a number of tweaks that make it more involving than before. Player levelling offers a more tangible sense of individual progress, while supporting squad members can still fulfil a useful role as a trainer. Players will gain additional experience by linking up with these coaches: should they form an affinity, you\u2019ll get an XP boost. If in its debut season MyClub seemed like a slightly tentative attempt to appeal to the FUT crowd, it\u2019s taken a clear and confident step forward to become a worthwhile alternative."

        "Content": "Right from the action-packed moments of its fantastic prologue, I couldn't help but notice how much better Bayonetta 2 looks and plays than its predecessor - or most other action games, for that matter. Impressively, Bayonetta 2 just gets better from there. With the style, grace, and precision of a runway model, she sashays, punches, poses, and kicks her way through an outstanding 10-hour campaign full of grand setpieces and deadly angels and demons. Building on the original Bayonetta\u2019s strengths, Bayonetta's 2 free-flowing combat remains its greatest asset. Each punch, kick, and weapon swing flows comfortably into the next empowering move. Everything moves at a fast and fluid 60 frames-per-second target (it never noticeably dipped), and this sequel feels supercharged thanks to excellent animation, more opportunities to cancel out of attacks mid-move to dodge, and fun new weapons to unlock, like the Rakshasa blades or the Chernabog scythe. Each feels distinct and has its own branching combos that can be mixed and matched to set up different styles of play. Executing combos feels natural, and it's invigorating to pull off long attack strings on a group of enemies. Perfectly timed dodges have a tangible reward thanks to Witch Time, a slow-motion payoff for dodging at the last second that allows me to dig in and devastate angelic foes. Once I factored in the new Umbran Climax - a high-power release of demon-summoning attacks that strike in a wide radius - I had plenty of ways to embarrass the opposition. No matter how large they got (and Bayonetta 2\u2019s enemies get enormous) my attacks could still send them reeling. Bayonetta\u2019s not overpowered, though. Even on normal difficulty, the enemies shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. The dozens of enemy types, from the small flying underlings to the large bosses themselves, have distinct attack patterns and signature tells that demand and reward your attention. Each boss has a cool and unique visual design, and no two behave the same way. The flying boss Valor, whose gold armor gives him the look of an angelic knight, fights much differently than the deadly Urbane, a ground-based foe that wields dual flaming gauntlets.  The constant enemy variety makes me feel like I\u2019m never fighting the same foe for too long or too often. Action gets chaotic, but big, colorful effects help make it clear what\u2019s going on at any given moment: successful last-second dodges set off purple-hued slow-motion moments, while Angelic minions, with the sculptured look of mythic statues, have a shimmering gold effect that signals they\u2019re winding up to attack. Clear visual language like this informs quick decisions, letting me confidently dodge and strike enemies down with a high-powered offense. The meticulous rating system gave me incentive to aim higher and experiment with new combos and moves. Each chapter rates you based on time played and combo prowess, with penalties to your score for items or continues used. It pushes you to do better with great rewards like score multipliers and extra currency to spend on new techniques, accessories, hilarious Nintendo-themed costumes, and items. Many elements of Bayonetta 2's presentation and mechanics are geared for hardcore action fans, but it attempts to embrace casual newcomers too \u2013 with mixed results. The GamePad-focused touch control option uses simple taps, holds, and swipes to send an A.I.-driven Bayonetta into attack. That alternate control scheme is a neat addition, but it doesn\u2019t hold up well with lots of enemies on screen because the camera has trouble keeping up. You\u2019ll have to learn the standard control scheme a few hours in regardless - and you should, because it\u2019s fantastic. There\u2019s also an online only, scenario-based co-op mode that squeezes a little more value out of Bayonetta 2\u2019s excellent combat. Each one is acquired by completing sections of the main campaign, and they distill combat to smaller area encounters with a group of enemies or even bosses. They\u2019re fun, but it\u2019s all over after just two- or three-minute bursts of action. As a finishing touch, Bayonetta's wicked weaves -- transformations involving powerful demonic accomplishes -- punctuate the end of an action sequence, often skewering enemies in outrageous death traps. They create some of the most extravagant moments, with gruesome enemy-munching sequences. Mashing buttons as a Godzilla-sized demon is turned in into devilish lunchmeat for one of Bayonetta\u2019s minions is a satisfying conclusion after a tense fight. title=&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=Bayo-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article But as much as I enjoy Bayonetta's over-the-top style, and I\u2019m not too put off by her hypersexualized character design, the writing does have a bad habit of occasionally slipping into annoyingly juvenile territory with some bad attempts at humor. I don\u2019t mind some juvenile humor to complement a light-hearted action game, but the jokes just lean on foul-mouthed punchlines and silly character tropes, and the sequences go on for way longer than they should. On the other hand, the writing has some good high points, like how it positions The Masked Lumen Sage as an excellent foil to Bayonetta. The times I fought him felt tense, as he firmly stood toe-to-toe with my heroine\u2019s high-powered abilities, summoning his own angelic helpers to counter my own. The excellent combat of Bayonetta 2 is boosted by superb art direction and pacing, both of which make Bayonetta 1 look poor by comparison. Missions never lets up, presenting more enemy types to fight across urban cityscapes, quaint mountain cities, and stylized interpretations of Heaven and Hell. Level designs give you room to take advantage of Bayonetta\u2019s shapeshifting abilities, so you can charge through a platforming area as a panther or swim through underwater sections as a sea serpent. It\u2019s also useful in combat as well. By double-tapping the dodge button I can quickly transform and close the space between opponents I fight on the ground, in the air, and underwater. title=More%20Hot%20Reviews&type=articles&tags=review-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article"

        "Content": "Though it may look primitive at a glance, your options in Minecraft are limited only by your imagination. Cobbling together a first home out of dirt and stone feels great; building a castle with a moat, a dining hall, and a working underground rail system feels even greater. That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of mining underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, and tense. It\u2019s one of gaming\u2019s most expressive creative outlets.  Minecraft\u2019s randomly generated worlds are composed of big blocky cubes of dirt, stone, sand, and dozens of other materials. The blocks are colorful, distinct, and memorable thanks to simple and charming textures. What makes them great is how they enable creativity. Piece by piece you\u2019ll rearrange and refine the pristine, primordial world into whatever you want. It could be a mountainside home, a brick house, a sky bridge, or any other creation you can envision. This is a power we rarely see in games, and the freedom it offers is, at first, daunting. In Survival mode, each block must be chipped at and collected by hand from an open world. What initially feels like a tedious task becomes the basis for Minecraft\u2019s rewarding core gameplay. I had to gather, transport, and place each piece of my home myself, so it was impossible not to feel a fierce sense of pride and ownership over it and all my other creations, big and small.  When the sun goes down, Minecraft\u2019s bad guys come for you. They are scary and dangerous\u2026 for maybe an hour. Even less once you obtain the simple items needed to ward them off. This feels immediately disappointing. Why have enemies at all if they become laughable in no time? But later, as my ambitions for building outgrew my resources on hand, my quest for new materials drove me deeper underground. Down there I realized those same enemies that are easy to defeat on the surface felt far more challenging to fight in the confines of a rocky corridor where they could ambush me. The amount of danger I was in was tied to how far from my base I roamed.  Losing everything I carried to a Creeper who got the drop on me was a heartbreaking lesson, but the excitement of exploring new places and the risk it entails provided a constant tension. All the while, gathering new stones and plants got me thinking about long-term projects, like a rock garden with a fountain or an underground irrigation system.  Those goals don\u2019t change when you bring friends in, but whether you\u2019re cooperating or trying to outdo each other with larger, grander creations, having other people there makes Minecraft more rewarding. The PS3 version of Minecraft allows four-player split-screen play, and there\u2019s an easy-to-use online mode that accommodates up to eight. I\u2019ve had a few issues with others not being able to join my game, but they were temporary and resolved themselves.  However, inviting friends into your world quickly makes clear one of Minecraft PS3\u2019s biggest limitations: the world size. It\u2019s tiny relative to the PC version, and finding the edge of the world happened all too quickly when I was sharing the space with others. Once I bumped into it, plans and ideas immediately shrank in scale. Learn a craft.  Minecraft starts with a quick and comprehensive tutorial that fully explains the basics of gathering, building, and crafting, and different stations around the tutorial world teach you how to enchant items, brew potions, start a garden, set up working electrical circuits, ride a boat, build golems, and more. If you thought Minecraft was just about stacking blocks, the tutorial will wipe away that perception quickly. There\u2019s a huge amount of activities going on here.  The crafting interface conveniently includes recipes for every item, and it highlights the items you don\u2019t yet have in your inventory. With dozens and dozens of combinations available, the built-in recipes keeps you playing rather than hunting through wiki guides and memorizing recipes.  Minecraft\u2019s many items and systems are too numerous to list in entirety, but a few stand out. As you kill things and mine certain materials, you\u2019ll earn experience orbs which can be spent on enchantments. It makes mining and fighting things faster, easier, and more fun. The same can be said for potions, which heal you, grant resistance to fire, and more. Light RPG elements like these add depth to Minecraft without bloating the interface with skill trees or stat screens. Don't suffer for your art. Under all that adventuring is Minecraft\u2019s brilliant building toy. Creative Mode basically turns on all the cheat codes and lets you play with it freely, turning off monsters, letting you fly, and giving you endless supplies of all the materials to build to your heart\u2019s content. Yeah, without having to work and fight for them, my creations in this mode felt a little hollow. Still, Creative Mode is as much fun as a bottomless tub of LEGOs, and between the fun of flexing my own imagination and checking out the amazing projects other people have constructed, it\u2019s full of possibilities.  Vita Version -- October 17, 2014  For better and for worse, Minecraft for the PlayStation Vita is almost identical to its PS3 counterpart. It\u2019s easy to lose yourself in Minecraft for hours on end, but sometimes creativity strikes in the most inconvenient places -- on a train, in the elevator. Having a full-featured version of Minecraft on the go lets you make quick changes and additions anywhere, which is a huge benefit only Minecraft: Pocket Edition fans have enjoyed until now.  It includes all features and updates from the console version, so you can transfer your creations between the two platforms freely. The process takes only a few minutes, and it\u2019s hugely convenient for playing on a larger screen when mobility isn\u2019t needed.  Minecraft Vita is set up for Cross-Buy with the PS3 version; owning either will net you a free copy of the other -- plus you can upgrade to Minecraft PS4 for a discounted price. It\u2019s disappointing that you can\u2019t Cross-Play with PS3 owners considering they\u2019re so similar, but being able to transfer your world between systems softens the blow. Also, you can transfer your world to the PS4, but after you do it once, you can no longer send that world back to your Vita.   Minecraft Vita\u2019s world size is also similar to the PS3\u2019s, but unlike the console, the Vita version supports only four players instead of eight. This sounds like a negative, but the silver lining is that it also means the Vita version never gets the opportunity to create situations that suffer as much from the overcrowding I describe above. The other significant limitation is performance. The Vita just isn\u2019t as capable as a PS3, and it sometimes shows in some occasional chugginess, especially in crowded areas. It\u2019s a minor annoyance at most, and even so, Minecraft\u2019s colorful worlds always look sharp and detailed on the Vita\u2019s screen."

        "Content": "Act 1 of Broken Age is a gorgeous, impeccably written adventure that simultaneously tugs at my nostalgic core, while ushering in a new era for the point-and-click genre. Any fears that Double Fine\u2019s pioneering Kickstarter would disappoint were immediately dispelled the moment I set foot into director Tim Schafer\u2019s beautiful fever dream. It takes the classic mold created in games like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, and modernizes it through smoothed-out design and gorgeous aesthetics. But what's more impressive is that Broken Age\u2019s tone expertly oscillates between moments of sheer hilarity and brutal poignancy, while telling a story whose first half instantly ranks among the finest I\u2019ve seen in video games.  The dual adventures of Shay, a lonely cosmonaut who may or may not be the last human alive, and Vella, a young woman who refuses her fate as a sacrificial lamb to the Cthulhu-esque beast Mog Chothra, are both handled with elegance. The script is packed with jokes and references that hit on so many different levels -- like a Pixar movie or an episode of Adventure Time, it handles comedy with a nuance that is rarely seen in games.  I fully expected a Tim Schafer adventure game to be rife with humor, and Broken Age certainly delivers. But what I didn\u2019t expect from Broken Age was a story that contained such powerful themes of loneliness, sacrifice, and what it means to really grow up. Though Shay and Vella live in very different worlds, the struggles they both face as they try to escape the figurative and sometimes literal shackles of their lives provided powerful bits of storytelling. It\u2019s a testament to the script that I found myself laughing and tearing up at multiple points over the course of the four-hour adventure.  The fantastic writing also carries over in Broken Age\u2019s great puzzle design. The logic here is on point, as Double Fine\u2019s strange machinations all make wonderful sense inside the confines of the world. Combining items, navigating dialogue trees, and exploring the world all contain the same sort of joy that Schafer famously harnessed back in the \u201890s. Broken Age proves that adventure games don't need to reinvent their gameplay to be outstanding \u2013 great writing, characters, and world design are the three pillars of creating a classic, and Double Fine has those in spades.  Broken Age\u2019s dual-character system also proved useful whenever I hit a roadblock -- getting stuck on one of Vella\u2019s puzzles and being able to instantly hop over to Shay's adventure acts as a great mental palate cleanser. That being said, I was a little bummed that the characters never really interact throughout Act 1. Day of the Tentacle has your three characters constantly exchanging items through time and causing ripples in one era that would affect another, and I'm hoping Act 2 (which will be delivered in a free update scheduled for later this year) brings in more puzzles of this sort.  But for as great as the writing and puzzle design in Broken Age are, it's the artwork that immediately springs forward as a defining feature. Nothing I can say will do justice to just how gorgeous Broken Age is. As trite as it might sound, the world feels like a picture book come to life. The coloring and animation in particular help lend an almost tangible feeling, and the relative simplicity of the character design helps make each citizen a memorable one. From Curtis, the lumberjack with an understandable fear of trees, to Harm'ny Lightbeard the Jack Black-voiced guru who may or may not be a snake-oil salesman, Broken Age's cast never ceases to delight.  Those Characters populate a creative smorgasbord of locales, and jumping between floating cities atop the clouds to lonely spacecraft that double as a child\u2019s playground made me want to take a screenshots and set them as my desktop's wallpaper in nearly every scene of the adventure. And while it lacks some of the cohesion of Grim Fandango\u2019s singular Day of the Dead motif, the sheer variety made me eagerly anticipate every new scene change. Interacting with the world is also great, thanks to a minimal use of menus that never interfere with the visuals on screen. It distills the traditional adventure game verbs into a simple and streamlined process of clicking and dragging items to use them on various objects in the environment. My one nitpick with the PC version of Broken Age\u2019s UI is that there\u2019s no easy way to simply scroll through the items in your inventory, which led to a few frustrating moments where I had to continually pop in and out of the item bar in order to solve a puzzle at hand. But honestly, any of those negative feelings immediately melted away the moment I continued exploring.  iPad Version The mobile version of Broken Age Act I displays the same fantastic art, puzzles, and humor as its PC counterpart. Honestly, I might like the iPad version even more thanks to how incredibly intuitive it feels to play an adventure game on a touchscreen, which alleviates the minor UI qualms I had with the PC version. Navigating the environment, observing elements peppered about, and solving puzzles with you fingertips brings even more intimacy to an already amazing experience."

        "Content": "The most remarkable thing about Rayman Legends is how consistently it introduces new and unpredictable ideas over its roughly 12 hours. This beautifully animated co-op game tosses dozens of inventive ideas into the mix, proving there's still room for exciting creativity in the platforming genre. Naturally, Rayman starts out with simple running, jumping, and punching, but before you know it you\u2019re sneaking past dozens of deadly traps, battling huge bosses, or playing through awesome challenge levels that look like '90s music videos. Every time I thought I found a personal favorite stage, the next one came along and replaced it.  I kept thinking the constant variety couldn't possibly hold up, but surprisingly, each of Rayman Legends\u2019 stages looks more impressive than the last. This sequel takes Rayman Origins ' colorful, animated look and feel in new directions. The beautiful transitions and clever bosses look stunning, expressive, and vibrant. A distinctly Loony Toons quality of the music and the adorable alien Teensies Rayman has to rescue give Legends character and personality to spare, even though there\u2019s not much story here. I love its subtle and inventive visual tricks that hide dozens of crafty secret areas in plain sight, and since most levels don\u2019t have time constraints, Legends gives us carte blanche to roam around to discover and appreciate secrets for ourselves.  Compared to most platformer characters, Rayman's jump physics tend to feel a little floaty, but I got used to it and grew to love it quickly. The levels he runs through never feel frustrating thanks to some great pacing, and the variety of stealth puzzle areas, standard platformer challenges, and shoot-'em-up-inspired gliding stages constantly kept me on my toes and eager to see what came next. No matter what the challenge, they\u2019re all brilliantly designed, and there\u2019s an incredible feeling of satisfaction that comes from clearing each stage.  Boss fights are some of the highlights of Rayman Legends. They don't reinvent the platforming boss battle, but these encounters show off some of the best visuals tricks, putting on a spectacular show. The Luchador, for example, is a towering mass of muscle who swings a huge hand and constantly launches his tiny opponents into the air. As I figured out his patterns and thumped him on the head, the reactions from the surrounding crowd sold the atmosphere of a big prizefight.  Amazing games like this one are always best when shared with friends or family, and almost every level feels finely tuned for both single-player and co-op. Things do get a bit chaotic when four players are jumping around at once \u2013 it\u2019s easy to get confused about which character is yours, since everyone shares the same screen and a lot of the character skins look similar. To be fair though, no platformer has really solved this problem yet, and Rayman does it as well as any. The one thing that's truly disappointing is that there\u2019s no online play, which means that other than some online leaderboards and daily challenges, Rayman Legends is stranded as a couch co-op game.  The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Rayman Legends support co-op for four players, and the Wii U version adds in one more using the GamePad. It\u2019s no secret that Rayman Legends was planned as a Wii U exclusive, and the Wii U GamePad works well with it to let one player take on an assistant role and help out the other four by activating switches in the environment. But Ubisoft came up with an elegant solution when it transitioned Legends to other platforms by letting Rayman command his flying encyclopedia assistant activate switches and levers using a single button.  On PS3 and 360, these puzzles require precise timing which makes it more difficult played in single-player, but I still found that to be a good challenge; it provides another interesting twist that gave me a fun level of control over the environment. It\u2019s great that Ubisoft figured out how to make this co-op idea work in single-player, and that the frequent and well-placed checkpoints make sure it never feels frustrating.  On Wii U, this setup is a little different: If you're playing single-player, at one point you switch to the perspective of the assistant, and gameplay moves to the GamePad screen in a hilarious transition. At that point, Legends takes advantage of the Wii U's hardware to have you play a minigame in which you pull switches to manipulate the environment to try to keep a computer-controlled Sir Globrax alive in labyrinth-like stages.  The PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions of Rayman Legends look the same as the rest, except at a higher resolution. But I didn't feel like this made a big difference in the visual quality, because Rayman's strength is in its arts style rather than its technology. The only benefit here is reduced load times that quickly allow you to zip into a level of choice. The PS4 version has one additional feature: You can take screenshots and then pan and zoom using the Dual Shock 4's touch pad.  It's a good idea that's a lot of fun in co-op, requiring careful teamwork and coordination, but in single-player it's the most frustrating part of Rayman Legends. Simply put, they transform it from a great platformer into a frustrating escort mission. No matter how carefully I would clear a path for Sir Globrax, he still doesn\u2019t always make good decisions. Sometimes he understands the trail you\u2019re trying to set for him, and even occasionally shows some level of desire for self-preservation, but often he\u2019ll go straight into a dangerous obstacle he could have avoided. Again, they're great when played in co-op, but constantly losing because of AI stupidity beyond my control made me want to avoid those missions entirely in single-player. No matter where I play it, though, Rayman Legends is a fantastic example of why platformers will never stop being fun. It got where it is by building on lessons that trace back to classic Nintendo-made platformers, such as Yoshi\u2019s Island and Wario Land 4 . Both games buck traditional genre trends and focused on exploration and discovery, and Rayman Legends takes the same approach and adds a consistent formula of smoothly increasing challenge, colorful presentation, and crazy variety that reminds me why I fell in love with this genre in the first place."

This revelation sprang forth for me a few hours into my first-person walkabout through the Greenbriar household. As I rummaged through an abandoned kitchen examining refrigerator notes, discarded paperback books, and surprisingly named bottles of salad dressing, the proverbial light bulb suddenly illuminated.  Yes, I was exploring the Greenbriar home, a digital space where the first game by The Fullbright Company is set. But perhaps more importantly, I was exploring something strikingly similar to the house I grew up in. Each time I clicked on an item owned by a family member and studied its various traits, like empty liquor bottles belonging to a father who may or may not drink too much, or a sarcastically written term-paper on the female reproductive system that highlights a young woman's sharp wit, I was brought back to the uncountable innocuous nick-nacks that populate my parent's house.   Throughout Gone Home, a first-person exploratory adventure game, you'll poke around a beautifully created house and examine the artifacts that populate each well-designed room, and everywhere you look the house has a warm, lived-in feel. The family's study is filled with interesting books to browse, records to listen to, and liquor cabinets to raid. The kitchen is as wonderfully disorganized as my mom's, and the bedroom of an angsty teenager feels like the bedroom of an angsty teenager. It oftentimes felt as if I had broken into a museum in the middle of the night with the goal of touching the very things that I was told not to touch. Games like The Last of Us and BioShock Infinite allow us to explore exceptionally realized worlds, but Gone Home's world just feels straight-up real.  Despite an ever-present sense of dread \u2013 lights flicker sporadically, a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and the house itself seems to moan at times \u2013 there's nothing to fear in Gone Home. The only skeletons here are figurative, which you'll eventually discover as you explore the house and begin to unravel the family's past.  As you delve deeper into the Greenbriar residence, you'll come across telephone messages, scrawled notes, and diary entries that provide the clues needed for you to begin illuminating the dark corners of this family. The writing and voice work here are among the best I've ever experienced in games. It's not stylish or exaggerated, but rather painfully real. Unraveling the story of your character\u2019s teenage sister Samantha's coming of age, the complicated intricacies of your parent's marriage, and eventually the reasons why you left home in the first place make Gone Home a powerful piece of storytelling. I'm being a bit vague for a reason, because so much of the emotional impact I felt stemmed from discovering these bits of backstory and piecing them together myself.  The writing and artifact design are so good that I felt compelled to grab everything that wasn't bolted to the floor and give it a closer examination. Turning around a can of soup reveals a fully written label. Thumbing through a VHS collection highlights a wealth of classics from Gone Home's mid-'90s setting. And entering a closet only to find it filled to the brim with board games, subtly weathered with use, all contribute toward making the Greenbriar household feel like a living, breathing place.   Doing this isn't just some menial task \u2013 scouring the house with a fine-toothed comb leads to optional story revelations, humorous asides, and sometimes both. For example, while rummaging through my father's study, I came across a box filled to the brim with dozens of copies of his unsuccessful second novel. But after removing the top few layers of literature, I unearthed he awful Pandora's Box of his smut magazine collection. This moment walked such a fine line between painful and comical, and it's only one of many that did so throughout my three hours in the house.  The only drawback to the inanimate objects that lay about the Greenbriar home is that by the end, you're sometimes examining a handful of the same things. Coming across the same box of tissues in every other room pulled me out of the world just a tad bit \u2013 like a deja vu glitch in the Matrix. Also, the first time I held my father's sophomore novel, I was completely enthralled with studying its cover. The second time, it made sense since that book was a commercial failure, and unsold copies would litter this house. The fifth time: not so much. But despite this infrequent repetition, Gone Home continually won me over in spades partially due to its impeccable use of music. A successful mix of a moody, ambient score and a variety of cult Riot Grrrl hits (played by sticking various cassette tapes found scattered throughout the house into a tape player) create an affecting ambiance. The two styles might seem to clash in stark juxtaposition on paper, but they somehow managed to meld together to give Gone Home a musical backbone that's riddled with both teenage angst as well as an air of mystery."

        "id": "53d517924919f769c150cfd48166af18",
        "Content": "There's a mutual awe between people discussing the deep secrets and mystery of Fez. Curiosity, envy, and excitement dominate conversations about bewildering thematic patterns, creative solutions to intelligent puzzles, and unforgettable level design. Players are likely to gush about the beautiful aesthetic and childlike sense of wonder in equal measure. They'll probably say something about the insane but exciting ambitions, how bad their brains hurt, and how cute the little hat is, too. Fez appeals to the adventurous soul's want for discovery, and delivers it in an entertaining and original way. After a catastrophic event adds a third dimension to a 2D world, Gomez, the fez-adorned hero, finds himself capable of shifting the dimensional plane. This is where Fez starts challenging player perception. Imagine the world like a four-sided column. With each pull of a trigger or press of A/D keys, Gomez rotates the column left or right 90 degrees. Each rotation displays a different side of the landscape, each of which has a distinct set of objects to interact with. This simple device changes where Gomez can go and how he can get there. If there's no means by which to climb higher, rotating the scene may reveal a hidden ladder or new ledge. Fez further complicates matters when it lets illusion become reality. Manipulating pieces in such a way that they look traversable is all Gomez needs to navigate. In twisting the world to your will, disconnected objects become the literal stepping stones to your success. Perhaps a single platform becomes part of a wall, or positions itself within jumping distance of another platform. If two separate, smaller ladders appear as one long ladder from a certain angle, they act accordingly. Fez makes no apologies for its complexities. Rather than relying on instruction, players discover possibilities by experimenting at their own pace. There's no threat, no urgency, and no consequence for death. Everything exists as is. It's just waiting for you to find it. The rotation gimmick could have made a simple side-scroller something far more frustrating, but the dozens of levels are all laid out quite cleverly. New areas are always within reach, and altering the camera gives Gomez plenty of extra opportunities to explore. You can always get to the next area, even if you don't quite know what to do when you arrive. One quarter of the opening area. Fez has so much to see and do that most players will make their way through numerous stages in a short span of time. They'll probably do so without realizing the number of treasure chests, alternative routes, or additional puzzles they've missed in each map. As they discover the rules and how best to get around, they'll return to earlier areas to dig deep into the remaining mysteries. Really, though, experiencing its aesthetic is Fez's true reward. The terrific detail of its pixel-painted universe, old-school-inspired music, vibrant art, and ever-changing scenery bring the brilliant world to life. There's such an absorbing diversity in the way levels look and sound that it's enough just to be part of it regardless of the character's goals. The whimsical tone to the writing in Fez also contributes to the overall idea that it just wants you to enjoy yourself. Early on, before Gomez gains access to the third dimension, everyone is ingrained in their 2D ways. Characters comment on how flat you're looking today and the nonexistence of other dimensions. They're so disbelieving of 3D that it's all they talk about. When a cube appears in the sky and blows up, everyone becomes frightened of 3D. Then it's up to Gomez to pick up its actual, exploded pieces. Owls, man. Owls. Fez also sneaks in some satirical material just for kicks. Dot, your helpful floating companion, doesn't know anything about anything. In any other game Dot would be your guiding force, a talking tutorial. It forgets what certain objects are for, if it even has anything to say other than \"Uh, I don't know what this is.\" Fez also goes out of its way to make the gaming-literate members of the audience smile. Tetris pieces have a prominent thematic presence in the quiet story. Most of the audio effects sound just like old NES games. Dot even busts out a \"Hey, listen!\" The most astonishing thing about Fez is how it, like the games it uses as inspiration, imposes itself on the real-world. The mechanical gimmick in Fez makes players consider and take advantage of perception. This thought often applies outside the game, too. Conditions to fully complete Fez include analyzing the Achievements list for a subtly placed password. Punching in the code unlocks a bonus collectible cube piece. It's the modern equivalent of the long-forgotten cheat code, or the codec frequency hidden on the back of Metal Gear Solid's case. Fez also forces itself on reality by tucking QR codes in secret spots. Scanning them gives players additional unlock codes. This means players need to find their smartphones, potentially download a QR-scanner application, or borrow someone else's device. One way or another, players need to stop playing and go out of their way to use a physical thing to interact with Fez. Without spoiling everything, it also tricks players on multiple occasions into thinking something is wrong with their computer. During my playthrough, I even wrote down locations of locked doors for later, and sketched abstract drawings as I tried to learn a made-up language. I haven't done anything like this in 15 years. This all makes sense, I swear. Fez pervades the player's life so completely it's almost corporeal. It's a forward-thinking game looking back, and that philosophy coalesces to make members of Fez-centric conversations sound like raving lunatics. When talks about manipulating dimensions, discovering fragmented cubes, talking to owls, finding treasure maps, and reading a funky moon language fire up, bystanders won't know what's going on. But they'll want to know, they'll want to learn, and they'll want to be part of it. Unlike the Xbox 360 and PC versions, Fez does not suffer any noticeable decrease in frame rate, ever, on PS4, PS3, or PS Vita. I did have one bug while playing Vita that caused the camera to focus on something other than Gomez, but a quick reboot of the game fixed everything. The fact that Fez is cross-buy on PlayStation works enormously in its favor, too -- and having a save file transfer from PS3 to Vita to PS4 is fantastic. The future is rad, and as Fez is so fond of reminding us, so is the past. "

        "Content": "Sometimes reviewers can't see the forest for the trees. When I finished Batman: Arkham City, I immediately cataloged what I thought it did wrong. It tossed in too many villains and didn't flesh them out, it clearly tried to replicate the Scarecrow stuff from the first game and didn't do it as well, and Batman still moves a bit stiffly when simply walking around. When I formed the list, I found myself disappointed with the game. But the days rolled on and I couldn't stop playing -- in fact, I only wanted to play more. The hundreds of things Batman: Arkham City nails outweighed my nitpicky problems. I realized Batman: Arkham City is a brilliant game. If you've missed the roughly 1.4 million stories on IGN, Batman: Arkham City picks up months after the events of Asylum. Former Arkham warden Quincy Sharp now reigns as the mayor of Gotham City, and he's moved the bad guys from Blackgate Prison and the inmates from Arkham Asylum to a cordoned off area in the heart of Gotham. This is Arkham City, Dr. Hugo Strange runs it, and Batman's job is to see what the hell is going on inside. It's an interesting story that starts with one of the best openings in modern games. After two years of dreaming about where this sequel would go, Batman: Arkham City delivered and hooked me. That can be said for most of the game. Fans of the Batman: Arkham Asylum will immediately be at home in Arkham City as developer Rocksteady took the core gameplay, refined it, and polished it. You brawl with one button, counter with another and leap when you feel like it. Batman's got a slew of new counter attacks -- including the ability to take out several attacking enemies at once -- and the ability to use nearly every gadget in battle with a hot key system. Even though the system can seem simple (that's if you ignore the combos and multipliers) the diversity in the attacks and battles keeps it interesting. I wanted to engage bad guys instead of sneaking past them. Maybe it was the promise of more experience points and the upgrades they unlocked, but it probably had more to do with wanting to see Batman dislocate another elbow. I feel more like Batman than ever before. \u201c Rocksteady kept me on my toes by peppering in special enemies. Guys with stun rods, armored outfits and broken bottles all have to be dealt with in very specific ways. I needed to assess threats and engage situations like Batman would. I don't know if I can express how awesome that makes a comic nerd like me feel; after years of hypothesizing how Batman would beat Character X, I now have to do it to survive. Feeling like Batman made Arkham Asylum a must-play, and Arkham City continues that tradition. I felt like I had the upper hand when I walked into a room where the enemies outnumbered me 20 to 1 because I could drop a smoke pellet, use freeze grenades to take enemies out of the game and basically kick ass. Five gunmen with hostages didn't scare me because I knew I could disappear into the shadows to string them up from gargoyles, punch through walls to take them down and glide kick them over railings. This feeling of empowerment carries over to bosses, which is weird at first but makes sense. No boss in Arkham City really gave me a challenge. In fact, they're all a bit easy. Mr. Freeze had me stumped for a while as once you use an attack on him you can't use it again, but then the Bat-computer just sent me a cheat sheet. (Although, disabling hints would've eliminated this moment.) That specific instance was no fun, but overall, the joy of Batman bosses is the journey to them and not the fight themselves. The Penguin will never challenge the World's Greatest Detective. Arkham City isn't an open world like Liberty City; it's more like a hub world with a bunch of dungeons like The Legend of Zelda or a bigger version of Batman: Arkham Asylum. You can't go into every building, but as you explore, you're going to find you're kept from discovering some of the 400-some Riddler Challenges until you double back with new gadgets. As you unlock the game's dozen side missions, you have to search nooks and crannies for murder victims and political prisoners in distress. If being Batman sounds good to you, expect to play this game twice and have the second time feel light years better than the first. New Game Plus unlocks after your first runthrough of Arkham City, and it carries over all your gadgets and shares your Riddler Challenge data. It also doesn't erase your original game's progress \u2013 it lives in its own section of your save. Historically, I despise playing games more than once. I know what's around the next corner, so where's the fun in it? Well, I adored Batman: Arkham City's New Game Plus. The difficulty is amped up, the enemies are more diverse from the get go, and the reversal indicators are turned off. New Game Plus takes the training wheels off and forces you to be Batman. When Batman enters a fight, he knows how to win; he just needs to execute his plan. That's you in this mode. You already know what's coming, you just need to execute your 45-hit combo, dodge explosives and save the day. This left me feeling more like Batman than ever before. I had the upper hand when I walked into a room where the enemies outnumbered me 20 to 1. \u201c Challenges rooms return and have been given an update since the days of Arkham Asylum. There are a dozen combat challenge maps (take out the four waves of bad guys) and a dozen Invisible Predator challenges (sneak around and silently eliminate all the bad guys) and each comes with three medals to earn. All that is standard, but Arkham City offers up Riddler Campaigns. These link three challenges together and apply gameplay modifiers like low health, time limits and so on. There's even an option to make your own Bat-exams. These challenges mainly serve to point out how slow my version of Batman is, but I'm glad they're here. They help hone my skills and provide leaderboards to chase and keep me playing. The four Catwoman story missions inserted throughout Batman: Arkham City are a fun (albeit simple) change of pace. This former downloadable content is now a natural, integrated part of Batman's story, and it expands the mythos of the game as you're playing it by changing perspectives to Selena Kyle to explain events that are happening off camera. Outside of the four missions, there are also has challenge maps for the feline and the ability to get the special Catwoman Riddler Trophies in Arkham City.  For those who played through Batman: Arkham City in 2011, the Armored Edition doesn't offer much in the way of incentives -- by and large, this is the same top-notch action/adventure game Rocksteady released last year. The new BAT mode gives you an additional combat option, but it's both unoriginal and ineffective. You'll charge a meter, activate BAT mode, and become mildly stronger in a fight. The inclusion of the Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion, Robin and Nightwing's challenge rooms, and character skins goes a long way to lengthen the experience, but the Wii U Game Pad functionality is clearly a consequence of launch-title experimentation. Arkham City looks and plays just as excellent as always on the Game Pad screen, but when it's used for touch-screen weapon selection, or as an in-game gadget, the Game Pad is just awkward. Moving the real-world object to look for in-game objects is a chore, and better left to the analog sticks. Glancing at the Game Pad to see your sonar radar is the best usage, really, but even then it's unexciting and not as helpful as simply absorbing yourself in the game proper."

        "Content": "The World Ends with You: Solo Remix is the latest Square Enix RPG port to hit iOS. The anime-styled RPG originally hit the Nintendo DS in 2008 to major critical acclaim thanks to its frantic touch-and-swipe combat. The entire experience has an unapologetically Japanese flavor. Set in Japan\u2019s Shibuya district, key cultural elements like fashion, cellphones, music and more influence the style and gameplay. The game\u2019s story involves a group of \u201cplayers\u201d trapped in a deadly game against \u201creapers,\u201d a group out to erase them from existence. It plays out in the UG (Underground), a sort-of layer off the real world of which most vanilla citizens are unaware. Reapers summon \"noise\" that the our hero, Neku Sakuraba, and his partners must defeat to survive. Square Enix has dubbed this iOS port a \u201cSolo Remix.\u201d While the original game had players controlling actions on separate screens, the update retools the combat system for single-screen play. A sync system is introduced in which you no longer control your partner character, but instead summon them for assisting attacks. Combat plays out through a unique pin system. Discovering and equipping pins unlocks new abilities and bonuses. Pins can level-up alongside the characters themselves, opening up plenty of depth. In battles the player select from the pins they've collected to plan a suite of attacks, some mapped to taps, swipes or unique patterns like circle-swipes. The system leads to frantic touch-powered battles. It all comes together when you're chugging through pins and syncing with your partner's attacks in sequence, building up to powerful focus attacks that generally clear the screen of lower-level baddies. When you're faced with a group of foes en masse things get visually and tactically hectic. Despite the madness, it's a barrel of fun. Bosses can get frustrating, but they're varied and sometimes involve some creative planning around a puzzle element.  Did we like it? The World Ends with You was one of the more unique titles in the Nintendo DS catalog and all that praise is still relevant and applicable here. The switch to iOS doesn\u2019t detract at all from the original, even with the dramatic change to combat. This port also adds tracks to the already-exceptional music and high definition art that looks gorgeous on Retina Display screens. So if you\u2019re deciding between the iOS and DS versions it\u2019s a pretty fair toss-up.  Both are equally recommended. The game itself is ridiculously complex in all the right ways. It politely pulls you in slowly, progressing through days on the in-game countdown clock while steadily introducing additional gameplay elements. You\u2019ll quickly hit a point when you realize you can level your pin\u2019s combat abilities, but those pins are also being affected by what brands are hot right now in Shibuya. Add in that you can reduce your level using a slider to affect not just enemy difficulty but item drops and quantity, and random battles can be stacked in a combo-chain to increase difficulty and rewards. With all this (and more), it becomes clear that The World Ends with You is no typical JRPG. The depth is intimidating, but it\u2019s also rare for an iOS-title. It\u2019s very appreciated. The controls are rock-solid, the music is awesome and there is an actual story with compelling characters to keep you entrenched. All these spot-on elements combine to make a fantastic, lengthy & stylish RPG adventure. Overall, they don\u2019t make \u2018em like this very often. It\u2019s a true-blue innovation-filled Square Enix RPG that reminds you why it was, and sometimes still is, the king of the genre.  Should you buy it? One of the only bad things to be said about The World Ends with You is the price-point. Square Enix doesn\u2019t seem to concern itself much with the platform\u2019s pricing norms, so the $17.99/$19.99 iPhone/iPad pricing is a little shocking. The price is steep for a single game on the platform but the fact that the game isn\u2019t iPhone/iPad universal for that price is downright offensive. You\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re rocking at least an iPhone 4 or an iPad 2 or newer. Sadly, original iPad owners won\u2019t be able to enjoy The World Ends With You. Still, this is one of the best games of the DS canon and its iOS asking price is still less expensive than the DS cart. Ignore the gouging and pick it up on iPhone or iPad to experience one of the more unique handheld role-playing games of the last decade."

This feeling of empowerment carries over to bosses, which is weird at first but makes sense. No boss in Arkham City really gave me a challenge. In fact, they're all a bit easy. Mr. Freeze had me stumped for a while as once you use an attack on him you can't use it again, but then the Bat-computer just sent me a cheat sheet. (Although, disabling hints would've eliminated this moment.) That specific instance was no fun, but overall, the joy of Batman bosses is the journey to them and not the fight themselves. The Penguin will never  challenge the World's Greatest Detective.  Arkham City isn't an open world like Liberty City; it's more like a hub world with a bunch of dungeons like The Legend of Zelda or a bigger version of Batman: Arkham Asylum. You can't go into every building, but as you explore, you're going to find you're kept from discovering some of the 400-some Riddler Challenges until you double back with new gadgets. As you unlock the game's dozen side missions, you have to search nooks and crannies for murder victims and political prisoners in distress.   Don't use the Batcomputer during this fight. If being Batman sounds good to you, expect to play this game twice and have the second time feel  light years better than the first. New Game Plus unlocks after your first runthrough of Arkham City, and it carries over all your gadgets and shares your Riddler Challenge data. It also doesn't erase your original game's progress \u2013 it lives in its own section of your save. Historically, I despise playing games more than once. I know what's around the next corner, so where's the fun in it? Well, I adored Batman: Arkham City's New Game Plus. The difficulty is amped up, the enemies are more diverse from the get go, and the reversal indicators are turned off.  New Game Plus takes the training wheels off and forces you to be Batman. When Batman enters a fight, he knows how to win; he just needs to execute his plan. That's you in this mode. You already know what's coming, you just need to execute your 45-hit combo, dodge explosives and save the day. This left me feeling more like Batman than ever before.  Challenges rooms return and have been given an update since the days of Arkham Asylum. There are a dozen combat challenge maps (take out the four waves of bad guys) and a dozen Invisible Predator challenges (sneak around and silently eliminate all the bad guys) and each comes with three medals to earn. All that is standard, but Arkham City offers up Riddler Campaigns. These link three challenges together and apply gameplay modifiers like low health, time limits and so on. There's even an option to make your own Bat-exams. These challenges mainly serve to point out how slow my version of Batman is, but I'm glad they're here. They help hone my skills and provide leaderboards to chase and keep me playing.   Catwoman Conundrum  Leading up to Batman: Arkham City, Rocksteady talked a lot about the Catwoman missions in the game -- that 10 percent of Arkham City was all about Selina Kyle. Well, it turns out that content isn't included on the disc. If you buy the game new, it comes with a one-time use code to download the Catwoman content. Used copies will most likely have the code snatched up and you'll need to buy the DLC off Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store.  If I can give you some advice, download and install the Catwoman missions before starting the game. Her four story missions, inserted throughout Batman: Arkham City, are a fun (albeit simple) change of pace, and literally change the opening of the game. I downloaded her stuff after beating the game the first time, and the integrated Catwoman stuff during my New Game Plus playthrough was way more enjoyable than just tackling her missions off the main menu. This is downloadable content that expands the mythos of the game as you're playing it. It explains events that are happening off camera.  Outside of the four missions, the Catwoman DLC gives you challenge maps for the feline and the ability to get the special Catwoman Riddler Trophies in Arkham City."

        "Content": "Up until last week I was still playing NBA 2K11. No other sports game has lasted me as long, and I was contemplating skipping this year's version because, hey, 2K11 is still fun and I like to take breaks between my sports games. That would have been a colossally stupid move. NBA 2K12 takes everything I love about last year and makes it better. Then it takes nearly all the parts I didn't like and turns them awesome. Hey, other sports games, you just got schooled. Again.     NBA 2K12 has three different covers highlighting the athletes that define basketball (though most gamers will see the Michael Jordan cover, marking the second year in a row his Airness takes the spot). But it's about a lot more than MJ this year. Last year's Jordan Challenges were the highlight of the game, but 2K12's NBA's Greatest mode trumps it. Michael Jordan is back, and along with him come Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen, and 10 other basketball greats. They're matched up in games against other basketball legends such as the '93 Hornets, Dikembe Mutombo and Shaq with the Orlando Magic. Every team you play as and against is unlockable, letting you pit the greatest players of the last 40-plus years against the stars of today. Want to see Dwight Howard go head to head against Shaq in his prime? Of course you do because that's awesome .  Each game gets the full presentational treatment. (You're going to hear a lot about presentation in this review, because NBA 2K12's is astounding.) The games are treated like television broadcasts from the era, so Bill Russel's mid-'60s Celtics game is in black and white. The announcers treat the games like playbacks, talking about your performance as if it already happened and sharing trivia about the players.  Last year, two of the biggest complaints were the cheap defensive AI and the alien looking players. NBA 2K12 improves on both counts, but it's not perfect. The defense never lets up and will take advantage on every play if you let them. They still occasionally become psychic (my favorite was Dallas Mavericks center Brendan Haywood executing a perfect backhanded block without ever turning around to see me coming in for the layup), but it's rarer. The fact is that you're given so much more control of your footwork and shots, that it's up to you to get around the defense, because the game won't do it for you anymore. Choosing which hand to shoot the layup from or which way to fake before a jump shot makes or breaks every point in the game, and NBA 2K12 give you full control. It takes a little while to get fully accustomed to, but the amount of control you have is incredible.  As for the players, many of them look better. Kobe Bryant got a noticeable improvement. There are still alien looking players on every team, and each time the game cuts to them it is a bit jarring. Everything else about the game looks so amazing, that it really stands out. People would watch me play and comment on how fantastic the game looks, and then boom, Jarret Jack comes on screen looking like he got stung by bees in his face or Steve Nash shows his hideous mug. (Granted, Nash is kind of ugly anyway, but still.)    For me, the improvements to My Player sold me on the game. Last year, My Player was the most popular mode in the game, which is surprising considering how slowly it started. For NBA 2K12, the developers streamlined the draft process. Instead of pickup games and a possible trip to the D-League, you hop into a single game, with full presentation, commentary, crowds, and flair. From there you go into interviews with three potential teams (so you can fine tune who exactly you end up with), and then it's straight to the draft.  After that, the mode feels very similar: you control your guy, meeting game objectives and trying to be a team player. But the developers made it easier to get into the game by making your player start out with higher stats and making the Teammate Grade system more forgiving. It's easier at first, but that's because this year you're trying to get into the Hall of Fame, which is no easy feat. You'll have to play your ass off to meet the requirements, and it takes a long time. My Player is one of the most robust single-player modes in a sports game, rivaling MLB The Show's \"Road to the Show\" mode. The gameplay is tighter, the presentation is broader, and it finally feels like your character is an actual NBA athlete.  Association, NBA 2K12's franchise mode, returns and is largely similar to last year's, but that's not a bad thing. Association does a wonderful job of putting you in control of the team. It's here that the presentation and commentary outshine other sports games. 2K12 treats every game like a televised matchup, with intros, animated roster lineups, and commercials for upcoming games. The crowds and stadiums are realistic and react to how well your team does. Seeing nobody show up to a Charlotte Bobcats game (a serious real life issue for the franchise) and then watching the seats fill as you take the Bobcats to their first ever playoff appearance highlights the level of detail. Playing the same team for dozens of games will cause the commentary to repeat a bit, but that's coupled with a multitude of commentary for every other team you play. There was an amazing bit where the commentators started joking about which famous politicians they roomed with in college, poking fun at Grant Hill's parents. I \"WTFed\" in the best way possible.   Bill Russell In Association, the trade AI is still smart, and won't be fooled easily, but they still offer up some odd deals that are objectively sound but realistically stupid. Sure, Chris Paul is having the best season of his career when I played him, but there is no way the Heat would offer Lebron James for him after their whole \"this is a Dynasty\" talk.  What I'm most excited about with Association is the new online mode. Players can set up a franchise and play with friends for an entire season. The demo I got and the few games I've played have been great, but it's hard to say how it will hold up when the servers get flooded. In a week or so, we'll come back with a full report on it."

        "Content": "Improving upon \"perfection\" is not exactly an easy job. Yet that's the task that falls before Nintendo and Grezzo, the co-developers of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D . The original Ocarina of Time, which debuted nearly 13 years ago, was universally hailed by critics, including IGN, as one of the best games of all time. It was a milestone achievement, redefining how we viewed action games and how developers made them. \"Revolutionary\" is by no means an understatement. Is it even possible to remake a game as influential and revered as Ocarina of Time? Is it possible to satisfy all audiences, new and old? As it turns out, the answer is yes, for the most part. What the teams at Nintendo and Grezzo manage here is a spectacular yet conservative and respectful upgrade. There are a few minor issues, including some areas where graphics could have received an extra boost, but by and large this tows the line between enhancing a decade-old game and meddling with something that is by most accounts flawless. Graphics will be the core focus of anyone buying Ocarina 3D, as it's the biggest alteration made and Nintendo's biggest showcase for the young 3DS's abilities thus far. Fundamentally this is the same game it ever was. Locations, structures and characters have all been preserved. However, textures, models and animations are all built from the ground up, and have been significantly revised. You'll still recognize everything and everyone, but you'll see them as they were originally meant to be. Ever look at the behind-the-scenes art for Ocarina of Time and wonder where things went wrong for the Moblin or even Link himself? The in-game graphics never quite lived up to the concepts crafted by Nintendo's artists. Those discrepancies are now gone. What's remarkable about the work done for the 3DS version is that it respects its source. It goes to the line set by the game's original artists and absolutely no further. The result is a game that seems so familiar you'd swear it's always looked like this. (Trust me, it didn't.) imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdsmedia.ign.com%2Fds%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F117%2F1177020%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d-20110617092759223.jpg&caption=The+Hero+of+Time+arrives+on+the+3DS. The dedication in preserving what made the original game so iconic is admirable, but in some instances it might have been a bit much. While there's no doubt characters should only be revised so much, environments are another thing entirely. While the enhanced textures and backgrounds in the game are quite impressive, resulting in some truly stunning locales (Castle Town in particular comes to mind), the basic architecture of some of these areas is still a bit archaic. You'll certainly run into some blocky looking hills and cliffs, instantly recalling this game's rather dated origins. It makes me wonder why some of this couldn't have been touched up. More awkward examples of this come in the form of stairs and open fields, where the blocky nature of the ground combined with more detailed textures makes it painfully obvious you're running up a sparse, flat surface. The concept of Ocarina 3D is identical to what it was so many years ago. Link, a young elf in the Kokiri Forest, is tasked with helping Princess Zelda to save the world. Along the way he explores nearly a dozen dungeons, acquires powerful artifacts, faces off against some of the most epic enemies and bosses ever devised, and does it all while navigating the past, present and future to prevent the land of Hyrule from falling into darkness at the hands of the evil Ganon. Back in 1998, Ocarina revolutionized 3D combat with its remarkably polished and innovative Z-targeting system, which forced a camera to lock-on to an enemy, giving players a perfect view of a battle. Many routine actions, such as jumping or climbing, were also automatic or dedicated to a single \"all-action\" button, allowing gamers to focus on puzzles, exploration and fighting instead of struggling to leap to a specific ledge or adjust their view to scale a wall. This new version goes a step further, using the touch-capable bottom screen of the 3DS to view maps and assign equipment. The system's gyroscope also allows you to view the world around you by physically moving the system. In the original game, players were forced to frequently pause to adjust inventory or check Link's location. That is easier and more streamlined now, despite the fact that the 3DS's button layout is different from the Nintendo 64's. This time Link only has two physical buttons (instead of three) that can be assigned, as well as two that are based entirely on the touch pad. This works for the most part, though I'd be remiss if I said I didn't miss that third item. Reaching over to the touch pad isn't quite as intuitive, nor is reaching over to go into a first-person view or activate Navi, your companion fairy and general pain-in-the-ass. (She now not only pesters you about what to do or how to fight enemies, but reminds you to take a break from playing the game every 15-20 minutes.) Being able to assign some functions or items to the d-pad would have also been welcome. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdsmedia.ign.com%2Fds%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F117%2F1177020%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d-20110617092758583.jpg&caption=A+gorgeous+world+could+have+looked+a+bit+better. Gyroscope aiming is deceptively useful. At first glance, it's a useless mechanic that disrupts the 3D effect. However using this method is so intuitive that you'll adjust over time. Considering I was often playing with the 3D off (outside of cutscenes), I ended up not even noticing most of the time. So the game's graphics and controls have been upgraded while still preserving the core of the game. That is and should be more than enough for any of you who have not played the game before. Ocarina of Time is a masterpiece, and that certainly had not changed. The developers weren't stupid enough to meddle with a formula that worked phenomenally back then, and realized that brilliant gameplay does not age - only technical concepts do. But what does the game offer those of you who know Ocarina of Time like the back of your hand? In addition to upgraded graphics, Nintendo has added the Master Quest version of the game, which twists dungeons and enemies around, requiring more skill and less reliance on memory than its counterpart. For the 3DS, the entire world in Master Quest has been flipped, meaning whatever used to be to the left is now to the right. It's a subtle difference, but if you intuitively knew the original, you'll find yourself suitably disoriented. The second change is that all enemies in this version now do double damage. The Zelda series isn't often known for its difficulty, but it's likely you'll find yourself in trouble with enemies dishing out more pain than ever before. In addition to Master Quest, there are a couple more additions to Ocarina 3D. As you complete the game, bosses are added to a \"Boss Gauntlet Mode\" that is accessible from Link's house in Kokiri Forest. Completion times are tracked, albeit not online, allowing you to compare your best times defeating each boss against your friends'. Additionally, when you've unlocked and beaten all of the bosses in this mode (which does not include the final boss), you can face all of these foes sequentially, with only a small health boost between them. The final alteration deals with a tips and tricks system built right into the game. As gamers progress through the adventure, special Sheikah Stones will give them the ability to see hint movies that will clue them into the locations of hidden items or give suggestions on how to beat bosses. It's an entirely optional concept, but it could be a big help to some of the younger or newer Zelda fans out there. All in all the revamped Master Quest, boss gauntlet and hint movies are great, yet it feels like there could have been a bit more. If you know Zelda exceptionally well, the core graphical enhancements are going to have to suffice. Most of these other things, though certainly nice, are merely a different colored icing on a cake that's largely the same. For some of us, experiencing Ocarina of Time through a shinier, clearer lens will be enough. Others will be left wanting, expecting and demanding that the core concept must change to warrant another purchase. Both perspectives are perfectly reasonable. I fall into the former camp."

        "Content": "As of this moment -- as I sit typing on my keyboard -- I'm 35 hours into Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and the game only has more to show me. I beat the story at the 17-hour mark or so, but with more than 100 Extra Ops serving as mini-games/challenges, my own Metal Gear to mold and customize, a platoon of 350 soldiers, dozens of hands-off Outer Ops missions to send troops out on and so much more, I don't know when I'll put this game down.  Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is probably the biggest game in the Metal Gear series, and it's only on Sony's smallest system.   Limited Edition Content In my experience, a lot of \"collector editions\" or \"limited editions\" really aren't worth the inflated price tag, but Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker Limited Edition is the exception to the rule.  For $10 extra, you get the regular game along with an oversized Peace Walker box to display, and a 60-page art book. The book contains beauty shots of the characters, concept art and a whole lot more. Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to finding somewhere to keep the slick display case in the IGN office.  More Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (Limited Edition) Info None of this is groundbreaking and it doesn't affect the game \u2013 so don't expect the score to change \u2013 but if you're a Metal Gear fan, it definitely is cool and it seems like Konami knew what they were doing by pricing it reasonably. A quality, affordable limited edition in the videogame industry?  !  Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker picks up the story of Naked Snake (AKA Big Boss) after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. It's 1974, and Snake's a bit disenchanted. After killing his \"traitorous\" mentor the Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake left the United States and founded Militaires Sans Frontieres, or soldiers without borders, a militia of sorts that takes on causes and missions for those who need their help. Soon, a professor and student show up begging for assistance. It seems that the CIA has invaded Costa Rica, and seeing as how the country doesn't have a military, the duo needs MSF to step in and set things right. Snake balks at the offer, but when the professor plays a tape that seemingly proves the Boss is alive, MSF takes the contract.  This conversation, which is pretty much one cutscene, sets up one of the Metal Gear franchise's best stories. One of the most common complaints about Metal Gear games is the convoluted stories. Who are the Patriots? Who's related to whom? What the hell is happening? Peace Walker doesn't go down that path. Snake takes this mission to find out if the Boss is alive. This is a man who is still visibly shaken over the events of Snake Eater. He loved this woman but had to kill her for his country. He's jaded, hurt and angry. He openly cries about what happened and needs to know what drove his mentor to work with the Soviets.  That's your motivation in this game. Sure, Snake wants to stop a Metal Gear from launching a nuke and killing millions, but he really wants to answer the questions that have plagued him since that epic battle in the field of lilies.  This plays out in traditional, third-person Metal Gear gameplay. You'll take Snake though jungles and riverbeds while popping bad guys with tranquilizer darts or bullets. You can crouch so that you can slowly and stealthily make your way through levels, hold up bad guys, choke opponents out, and so on. As always, this is a stealth game, so your goal is to complete the mission objective without being seen or heard. If the guards get wind of you, they'll go on alert, call in backup, and make your life miserable.   The pencil-drawn flashbacks are beautiful. Of course, it's not entirely the same old \u2013 but awesome \u2013 thing here. Snake's still packing his close quarters combat moves, but I found them easier and more useful than ever in Peace Walker. When you can execute a CQC action, you just hold the right shoulder button and latch onto the opponent with a sleeper hold. From here, you can threaten him with a stun rod or use the new throw move to hurl him into walls (an instant knockout) or into other people. If there are others around, you can chain your CQC moves together with a timed button press for rad combination animations where Snake flips dudes and disarms them.  As I've already written about , this game is huge. You're building MSF in this game \u2013 creating the infamous stronghold known as Outer Heaven that Solid Snake will have to destroy in the original Metal Gear \u2013 so another tweak on gameplay this time around is having to capture enemies to fill out your squadron. In Portable Ops, you did this in a way \u2013 knock guys out, drag them to your truck, and they'd be available to play with \u2013 but here, it's streamlined. You knock the guy out, hook him up to a Fulton balloon, and a helicopter snatches him out of the sky while you continue on the mission. This is beyond addictive. Even when my squad was teeming with people, I'd go out of my way to capture everyone I could, which includes hidden POWs in every level.   What are you capturing all of these guys for? They're the lifeblood of the game. You'll snatch these men and women and then get to assign them to divisions of your army \u2013 combat, research and development, intel, and so on \u2013 based on the multitude of stats that each character has. Guys assigned to your combat unit can take Snake's place in missions or be dispatched in Outer Ops; and R&D folks develop new weapons, items and upgrades. Keep recruiting, keep getting better people into these divisions, and you'll keep getting cooler crap.  It's like crack. I can't tell you how many of my hours I've spent with this game just sorting troops by their ability to make food so that I can make sure I have the best mess hall so that my crew is happy. I pick up POWs and pray that they're the \"S-rank\" troops I've been looking for to really pull my R&D department together and get me the final upgrades I need.    Grab your gun and watch the video review.  Peace Walker puts an emphasis on shorter gameplay sessions, so each mission is its own task. You'll select the one you want to go out on, get a cutscene if it calls for it, go out on your mission, and get a stat screen grading you on the number of alerts before getting booted back to the menu. This is a nice change of pace for a number of reasons \u2013 first and foremost because it gives you control over your loadout for each scenario you're entering. Oddly, you can't save mid-mission, and that might be a drag as some battles go on for a while.  As you unlock and find different suits for Snake, you're going to want to wear them in specific situations. See, the suits are better/worse for certain areas when it comes to camouflage (jungle vs. urban), they allow you to carry different numbers of items and weapons, and some have unique abilities (in the sneaking suit, you can move as fast as you want and be completely silent). Because the missions are self-contained, you can use your weapon-limited sneak suit to get through an entire level, have the level end as you get your first glimpse of a boss, and then start the \"new\" mission where you fight the boss and have your battle suit armed along with its extra weapon and item slots. It's awesome, and key to dominating missions.  The missions being broken up is great for the PSP because Peace Walker is phenomenal at dangling carrots in front of your face. When these missions end, you return to Mother Base where you're inundated with information \u2013 what your research and development team has created in the way of weapons and items, how the troops you dispatched on missions fared, who has come to join your army, and so on.  The game is insanely deep.  Adding to all of this is the focus on co-op. Every mission in Peace Walker \u2013 whether it be a story mission or one of the 100-plus Extra Ops \u2013 is available for you and a buddy to conquer. Co-op is only available via ad-hoc, but it's still a nice option. If it's a boss battle (a tank, a helicopter or a Metal Gear), four players can set out to best the beast. Whatever you do as a team, you benefit from as a player. If you Fulton out seven players total, you each get those seven players for your squad. If one of you climbs inside an AI core and unlocks a bunch of memory boards to use in your personal Metal Gear, you all get those boards.  Co-op is great. I'm a single-player fan and didn't know if I'd dig playing with others, but marching around levels capturing bad guys and decimating bosses is a blast with friends.  However, co-op leads to one of my main complaints with Peace Walker \u2013 and I only have two. This co-op focus means that some of the game is a pain in the ass (if not entirely undoable) by yourself. I've seen a ton of other game critics \u2013 folks I know can play \u2013 struggle and scream over some of the boss battles in this game. For me, I thought they were crazy until I came to the second battle with the final boss \u2013 Peace Walker itself. On my third attempt, I played for 45 minutes before running out of ammo and having the mission called off.  The curse words I screamed would make Dennis Leary blush.   The gameplay you know is here and awesome. In the end, I couldn't beat Peace Walker without the help of another player who was way past that point. That shouldn't be an aspect of a game like this. It's perfectly fine to make the Extra Ops super-difficult \u2013 and trust me, the repeat battles with tanks and the Cocoon are \u2013 but a solo player should be able to get through the story by him or herself. Granted, you might be able to replay missions and upgrade your weapons so that certain bosses wouldn't give you much trouble, but I'm no rookie and I don't think that I should've been dealing with the trouble I was dealing with.  The second issue with Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker? It's almost too deep for its own good. Don't get me wrong, the depth is one of this game's greatest assets \u2013 I won't stop playing until my army has conquered all of the Outer Ops \u2013 but there isn't much in the way of guidance. There are really, really general tutorials in the game, but they don't give you an adequate idea of how to make trades with other players, how to make your own Metal Gear songs, or how to make the most of the mechs you've acquired. To learn these tenets of the game, you have to either go through some trial and error or have a \"Big Boss\" on hand to walk you through the game.  Of course, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker doesn't stop there. On this UMD (or digital download for you cool kids) is a pimped out competitive multiplayer mode where you can go head to head with five other friends in games of deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture and base defense. The modes are fun, but they didn't do much for me \u2013 it's just Metal Gear Online, which is no small feat for a portable game. If you can get six Peace Walker fanatics together at one time, have at it, but the game is more about co-op in my eyes."

It seems that the CIA has invaded Costa Rica, and seeing as how the country doesn't have a military, the duo needs MSF to step in and set things right. Snake balks at the offer, but when the professor plays a tape that seemingly proves the Boss is alive, MSF takes the contract.  This conversation, which is pretty much one cutscene, sets up one of the Metal Gear franchise's best stories. One of the most common complaints about Metal Gear games is the convoluted stories. Who are the Patriots? Who's related to whom? What the hell is happening? Peace Walker doesn't go down that path. Snake takes this mission to find out if the Boss is alive. This is a man who is still visibly shaken over the events of Snake Eater. He loved this woman but had to kill her for his country. He's jaded, hurt and angry. He openly cries about what happened and needs to know what drove his mentor to work with the Soviets.  That's your motivation in this game. Sure, Snake wants to stop a Metal Gear from launching a nuke and killing millions, but he really wants to answer the questions that have plagued him since that epic battle in the field of lilies.  This plays out in traditional, third-person Metal Gear gameplay. You'll take Snake though jungles and riverbeds while popping bad guys with tranquilizer darts or bullets. You can crouch so that you can slowly and stealthily make your way through levels, hold up bad guys, choke opponents out, and so on. As always, this is a stealth game, so your goal is to complete the mission objective without being seen or heard. If the guards get wind of you, they'll go on alert, call in backup, and make your life miserable.   The pencil-drawn flashbacks are beautiful. Of course, it's not entirely the same old \u2013 but awesome \u2013 thing here. Snake's still packing his close quarters combat moves, but I found them easier and more useful than ever in Peace Walker. When you can execute a CQC action, you just hold the right shoulder button and latch onto the opponent with a sleeper hold. From here, you can threaten him with a stun rod or use the new throw move to hurl him into walls (an instant knockout) or into other people. If there are others around, you can chain your CQC moves together with a timed button press for rad combination animations where Snake flips dudes and disarms them.  As I've already written about , this game is huge. You're building MSF in this game \u2013 creating the infamous stronghold known as Outer Heaven that Solid Snake will have to destroy in the original Metal Gear \u2013 so another tweak on gameplay this time around is having to capture enemies to fill out your squadron. In Portable Ops, you did this in a way \u2013 knock guys out, drag them to your truck, and they'd be available to play with \u2013 but here, it's streamlined. You knock the guy out, hook him up to a Fulton balloon, and a helicopter snatches him out of the sky while you continue on the mission. This is beyond addictive. Even when my squad was teeming with people, I'd go out of my way to capture everyone I could, which includes hidden POWs in every level.   What are you capturing all of these guys for? They're the lifeblood of the game. You'll snatch these men and women and then get to assign them to divisions of your army \u2013 combat, research and development, intel, and so on \u2013 based on the multitude of stats that each character has. Guys assigned to your combat unit can take Snake's place in missions or be dispatched in Outer Ops; and R&D folks develop new weapons, items and upgrades. Keep recruiting, keep getting better people into these divisions, and you'll keep getting cooler crap.  It's like crack. I can't tell you how many of my hours I've spent with this game just sorting troops by their ability to make food so that I can make sure I have the best mess hall so that my crew is happy. I pick up POWs and pray that they're the \"S-rank\" troops I've been looking for to really pull my R&D department together and get me the final upgrades I need.   Click here and watch all the crazy crap in this game.  Peace Walker puts an emphasis on shorter gameplay sessions, so each mission is its own task. You'll select the one you want to go out on, get a cutscene if it calls for it, go out on your mission, and get a stat screen grading you on the number of alerts before getting booted back to the menu. This is a nice change of pace for a number of reasons \u2013 first and foremost because it gives you control over your loadout for each scenario you're entering. Oddly, you can't save mid-mission, and that might be a drag as some battles go on for a while.  As you unlock and find different suits for Snake, you're going to want to wear them in specific situations. See, the suits are better/worse for certain areas when it comes to camouflage (jungle vs. urban), they allow you to carry different numbers of items and weapons, and some have unique abilities (in the sneaking suit, you can move as fast as you want and be completely silent). Because the missions are self-contained, you can use your weapon-limited sneak suit to get through an entire level, have the level end as you get your first glimpse of a boss, and then start the \"new\" mission where you fight the boss and have your battle suit armed along with its extra weapon and item slots. It's awesome, and key to dominating missions.  The missions being broken up is great for the PSP because Peace Walker is phenomenal at dangling carrots in front of your face. When these missions end, you return to Mother Base where you're inundated with information \u2013 what your research and development team has created in the way of weapons and items, how the troops you dispatched on missions fared, who has come to join your army, and so on.  The game is insanely deep.  Adding to all of this is the focus on co-op. Every mission in Peace Walker \u2013 whether it be a story mission or one of the 100-plus Extra Ops \u2013 is available for you and a buddy to conquer. Co-op is only available via ad-hoc, but it's still a nice option. If it's a boss battle (a tank, a helicopter or a Metal Gear), four players can set out to best the beast. Whatever you do as a team, you benefit from as a player. If you Fulton out seven players total, you each get those seven players for your squad. If one of you climbs inside an AI core and unlocks a bunch of memory boards to use in your personal Metal Gear, you all get those boards.  Co-op is great. I'm a single-player fan and didn't know if I'd dig playing with others, but marching around levels capturing bad guys and decimating bosses is a blast with friends.  However, co-op leads to one of my main complaints with Peace Walker \u2013 and I only have two. This co-op focus means that some of the game is a pain in the ass (if not entirely undoable) by yourself. I've seen a ton of other game critics \u2013 folks I know can play \u2013 struggle and scream over some of the boss battles in this game. For me, I thought they were crazy until I came to the second battle with the final boss \u2013 Peace Walker itself. On my third attempt, I played for 45 minutes before running out of ammo and having the mission called off.  The curse words I screamed would make Dennis Leary blush.   The gameplay you know is here and awesome. In the end, I couldn't beat Peace Walker without the help of another player who was way past that point. That shouldn't be an aspect of a game like this. It's perfectly fine to make the Extra Ops super-difficult \u2013 and trust me, the repeat battles with tanks and the Cocoon are \u2013 but a solo player should be able to get through the story by him or herself. Granted, you might be able to replay missions and upgrade your weapons so that certain bosses wouldn't give you much trouble, but I'm no rookie and I don't think that I should've been dealing with the trouble I was dealing with.  The second issue with Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker? It's almost too deep for its own good. Don't get me wrong, the depth is one of this game's greatest assets \u2013 I won't stop playing until my army has conquered all of the Outer Ops \u2013 but there isn't much in the way of guidance. There are really, really general tutorials in the game, but they don't give you an adequate idea of how to make trades with other players, how to make your own Metal Gear songs, or how to make the most of the mechs you've acquired. To learn these tenets of the game, you have to either go through some trial and error or have a \"Big Boss\" on hand to walk you through the game.  Of course, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker doesn't stop there. On this UMD (or digital download for you cool kids) is a pimped out competitive multiplayer mode where you can go head to head with five other friends in games of deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture and base defense. The modes are fun, but they didn't do much for me \u2013 it's just Metal Gear Online, which is no small feat for a portable game. If you can get six Peace Walker fanatics together at one time, have at it, but the game is more about co-op in my eyes."

        "Content": "Every now and then, a piece of software comes out that defies everyone's expectations of what a given gaming platform is capable of. Like that fully functional space shuttle simulator released for the Atari 2600, or the graphical operating system they made for the Commodore 64. Monster Hunter Tri is one such historical abnormality. It just shouldn't be possible \u2013 it brings hard-core MMO-style gaming to a casual console, and stunning graphics to the most notoriously underpowered games machine of this generation.  For those who know the series inside out, Tri achieves something even more remarkable: it's a reboot that preserves the core gameplay elements of the series, yet rearranges everything else in entirely unexpected ways. The more time you've clocked on Monster Hunter, the more Tri will seem like an all-new experience.   I'm pretty sure that one's known as the Bloodbottler. Thankfully you can weaken it by tricking it into eating a Snozzcumber.  The basic mission structure is unchanged: within a generous time limit you're free to roam over vast slabs of fantastical primeval wilderness, plundering natural resources, skinning the wildlife, or just admiring the scenery. Only now the reptilian rulers of this absurd animal kingdom have more complex, and more fluid attack patterns... and so do you. All the returning weapons classes have new attacks and more complex combos.  Even the lowliest boss in the game, an over-sized purple Velociraptor called the Great Jaggi, can really keep you on your toes, with sideways body-slams that seem to reach half way across the map. And even the most maligned weapon class, the Sword & Shield combo, has some impressive new tricks, like a stun-inducing shield bash move.  The elemental attacks dealt out by monsters are far more devastating in Tri. For instance, get hit by a fireball, and you'll get 'Fire Blight,' also known as 'Being On Fire.' Diving into a body of water is enough to cure this condition, but the best defence is to avoid getting hit in the first place. This is achieved by observing monster behaviour closely, ever-ready to roll out of the way. Speaking of water, fighting in the newly-introduced underwater stages is an entertaining diversion, as you have to adopt a more ponderous, deliberate play style.   Elf needs food - badly!  Between missions, when you're chilling in the offline village of Moga or the online city shards of Loc Lac, every aspect of resource management has been streamlined to within an inch of its life. A great example is how farming is handled in Tri. As with every game in the series to date, resources in this fantasy world are scarce. Players must be both hunters & collectors, and gather resources in the field: mushrooms and herbs to mix potions, ores to forge armour and weapons, and fish to create, er, ammunition. When venturing out on a quest, it's always wise to take a pickaxe and a bugnet, in case you spy any juicy resource spots. For while there's a farm linked to the central hub zone that provides a steady supply of goodies, they now come at a price.  In the last game, farming was free, yet time-consuming. A full sweep of Pokke Farm could take you a good five minutes, sapping precious moments from your hunting schedule. Now you have a team of Felynes (mischievous kitty-cat people) to do your farming for you, cutting the procedure down to mere seconds. Likewise, the Moga fishing fleet is at your disposal, eager to venture out in search of fish or sunken treasure \u2013 these subcontractors can even go hunting monsters for you, and deliver low-level carves straight to your item box. Yet all these services cost Resource Points, and Resource Points aren't free.   Hence the introduction of free-form hunting. In addition to venturing out on any of the structured Guild missions, there's always the option of simply wandering into the nearby Moga Woods map and doing whatever you please: carving the horns off deer, foraging for dino-dung (a fabulous fertiliser), and slaying the boss monsters that roam randomly through the map. The further you progress in single player, the deadlier the free-range monsters you run into, and the more Resource Points you'll get for slaying them. Every kill adds to your tally; time spent massacring docile herbivores is never time wasted.  Combine this time limit-free ad-hoc hunting with a bit of gathering from resource points that randomly re-spawn as you play, and you have a fairly relaxing alternative to the strict, merciless victory conditions imposed by the Guild.  Another stress-reducing feature is the introduction of secondary mission objectives. By giving you the option of ending a quest once you've completed one of these minor tasks \u2013 like, say, severing a monster's tail \u2013 you can now bail out of a quest with a skerrick of your pride intact. It's a handy option for when you run out of potions, pack the wrong equipment, or simply find yourself outclassed by the latest walking freakshow you've signed on to eviscerate.   Fleshlumpeaters put up one hell of a fight.  In Monster Hunter Freedom Unite , micro-managing your small workforce of buff-cooking chefs and AI co-op buddies was an ordeal. Now there is only one of each, and both are far more versatile and effective. Better yet, you spend around 80% less time stuffing around with them, which in turn frees up more time for hunting. You no longer have the option of paying a chef to cook your stamina-boosting steaks for you in bulk, but the all-new double spit-roast accessory lets you cook them yourself in a fraction of the time.  The single-player mode is substantial. Even a determined, skilled player will most likely take weeks to burn through to the final boss, and if you wish to collect most or all of the sets of armour and weapons, then you're guaranteed months of happy grinding as you re-do missions to get all the materials. High-Rank equipment will often need to be made from carves with 5%, or even 2% drop rates, and that means hunting dozens and dozens of wyverns. Likewise, you'll need stacks of coins from the Arena Mode to craft certain rare sets of armour; a good an excuse as any for marathon split-screen sessions.  Tri's true longevity will most likely lie in the online mode. While there are quests of every rank available at all times, there is also a rotating selection of special Event Quests, with rewards that go towards an exclusive tier of goodies, including a pair of enchanted leather pants. More importantly, playing co-op with other humans truly brings the game to life. Whether your hunting squad is running like a well-oiled machine, or you're all screaming abuse at the one guy who keeps dying, the unpredictable nature of play always make co-op feel like an occasion.   An underwater fight against the Gizzardgulper. "

        "Content": "You've got to hand it to Rockstar; the mighty developer knows how to chase a headline. From the outset, putting 'gay' in the title raised eyebrows \u2013 even though it shouldn't have. But it did \u2013 it grabbed players and begged to be investigated further. As it turns out, Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony isn't some unabashedly obtuse grab for attention but a one-two punch that aims to surprise \u2013 the ultimate set-up for one of Rockstar North's finest dozen or so hours of recent years.  The familiar structure is in place; Luis Lopez is a likeable thug working for nightclub owner and underworld figure Anthony 'Gay Tony' Prince. Luis has a heartfelt professional admiration for his boss and, as the story progresses, this relationship is strained by Gay Tony's unfortunate financial predicament.  Luis has his apartment, missions to complete, women to liaise with in toilet cubicles, mini-games and events to participate in (including a hilarious dance-off at a gay nightclub). While also the most outlandish of the three GTA IV scenarios this iteration, Gay Tony is also arguably the most heartfelt and endearing.    Unlike The Lost and Damned's Johnny Klebitz , who was an unlikeable mess of a lead character, Luis is at heart a good guy, more along the lines of Carl Johnson in GTA: San Andreas. Luis is a family man, running missions to help his mother and to keep his dysfunctional family on the right side of the thin blue line. His allegiance to Tony is touching at times, scooping him off the floor of a stress-induced drug binge, splashing water on his face (well, dropping his head in a sink and flushing it with water). As a character, he's compelling \u2013 and it makes the action moments all the more surprising.  The dog has been let off the chain: things explode with pleasing frequency in The Ballad of Gay Tony. The gameplay we've been craving since Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is back \u2013 and by the gods, it makes a big difference to the tone of the tale. Without spoiling things, take this one mission as a good case-in-point.  You're thousands of feet above the Statue of Happiness, taking part in the ultimate triathlon. Diving from the helicopter, you spiral towards the earth below. Activating a parachute, you weave between three other competitors, each vying for a speedboat below. After landing on the boat, you race through a series of checkpoints, skimming between a wrecked ocean liner and a sheer cliff face. Sliding onto land, you race by foot to a lethally-fast sports car, equipped with a gutbustingly-fast nitro kit, and slam into the turns in a cross-city street race to the finish line.  Oh hell yes.  Whether it's defending  a tank that you've just plucked out of the sky while it was being airlifted or scaling the tallest building in the city and fending off choppers with an explosive-shell-equipped shotgun, the action bar has been raised yet again in Gay Tony, addressing the overall lack of big-ticket action thrills in the first two games.   The bitch is back.  As a direct result, we had a heck of a lot more fun with Gay Tony than The Lost and Damned. Of course, these two releases couldn't be more different tonally and from a storytelling standpoint; whereas The Lost and Damned told a story of respect and violence in the context of a bikie gang, The Ballad of Gay Tony is almost exclusively a glamorous, well-funded and excessive affair. You never struggle for cash and weapons, the women (and men) are beautiful, the drugs are plentiful and the characters are amongst the most unhinged and entertaining in the GTA catalogue.  Remember Brucie? The hyperactive, muscle bound sometimes-buddy of Niko from GTA IV? He has a brother \u2013 and, incredibly, he's more offensive and egotistical than Brucie \u2013at one point, reducing him to tears over a game of Chess. Oh how we laughed.  The characters are complimented by greater mission variety than you might expect; the typical 'ridin' dirty' missions are in there, as are the straight-up gun fights. But the aerial battles add a new playing field to tackle, the BASE jumping points are endlessly entertaining and the city has a newfound verticality that you can really take advantage of. It's never been easier \u2013 or more fun \u2013 to rack up that six-star wanted level.   While GTA IV overdosed on depth-of-field, dithering and times of day where the lighting would filter the colour out of the landscape, The Ballad of Gay Tony is almost always crytal clear and saturated with colour. Like the grain and ruddy browns of The Lost and Damned, Gay Tony has its own distinct look \u2013 and it's now our personal favourite. Minor improvements to an already impressive engine make this the best looking of the three episodes.  The only real area that is beginning to suffer visually rests with the character models themselves. There have been some impressive leaps in facial animation and texture work in the industry over the last eighteen months, and the somewhat blocky models and stiff lip-synching is a little bit disappointing.  At the same time, the dialogue and storytelling is so strong that you'll forgive the inevitable dating of the RAGE engine. Hopefully, given a couple years of media blackout, RAGE will be updated and we'll all be wowed yet again.  There are a few dents in the bodywork gameplay, however \u2013 and ones that stick out more and more as other solid action titles emerge. For one, the cover system remains somewhat unintuitive; the automatic detection of surfaces behind which you can hide is decidedly hit-and-miss (no pun) and the clunky ladder-climbing and inability to fire from ledges or while on ladders adds to the frustration.   The Ballad of Gay Tony will restore your faith in the GTA series - assuming it was shaken in the first instance.  While the inclusion of helicopters and choppers is a grand move, the lack of lock-on aiming (or any kind of aiming reticule or way of honing your precision) is baffling. If your enemies can lock onto you, surely we should be offered the same option.  Finally, walking is cumbersome. It is. The turning circle, while naturalistic thanks to the glories of NaturalMotion's Euphoria engine, is imprecise. During a heated battle in say, a carpark full of SWAT, exploding cars and heavy machine gun fire, you're already struggling with the cover system \u2013 you don't need to worry about trying to manipulate Luis in just such a way that he's behind a pillar.  Going down the list of content additions, improvements and refinements, it's a wonder that these points weren't refined. Still, it's hard to sniff at more multiplayer maps, a bevy of incidental missions with hilariously dirty characters and twisted outcomes. There is a predictability to the Grand Theft Auto formula that The Ballad of Gay Tony just can't shake, but for what it's worth, it's still addictive, fun and, at times, thought-provoking.  As DLC, The Ballad of Gay Tony is an incredible offering, but when combined with The Lost and Damned in 'Episodes From Liberty City' at retail, it's irresistible. If you haven't played the first episode, make sure you read our review here . Between these two offerings, there's more content than the original Grand Theft Auto IV \u2013 and the variety makes for a wholly more enjoyable experience than both previous titles at times.  "

        "Subtitle": "Bungie's sci-fi shooter never sounded so good.",
        "Content": "A Halo soundtrack with jazz elements? As bizarre as that may seem, listen closely to the music in Halo 3: ODST and you'll hear hints of noir-like saxophone, piano, and guitar blended with the dark, moody beats.  The fresh sound for the hit videogame series is a result of composers Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori stepping up to Bungie's challenge for an intimate detective story score that still feels like it belongs in the Halo-verse. The ODST soundtrack, available now as a 17-track, 2-disc set or digital download, does just that... with excellence.  Established Halo themes are there, but they're draped in fresh tones. Sometimes the references to past games barely register, but they're evident enough to keep the new musical stylings from feeling completely, shall we say, alien.  O'Donnell and Salvatori have ordered the tracks to match what you would hear if you played straight through the game. As O'Donnell explains on the sleeve, \"Since there is no interactivity on a CD, the adaptive music has been 'frozen' in this particular version.\"  It's tough to pick a standout suite. You may not find yourself humming any of these tracks, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is one of the most emotionally involving videogame soundtracks we've ever heard.  \"The Rookie,\" so named for the game's protagonist, is one of the stronger pieces when tied into gameplay. Not nearly as understated is \"Traffic Jam,\" a guitar-oriented theme that builds to a dramatic conclusion. Tracks like \"Asphalt and Ablution,\" and \"Neon Night\" run the gamut from light and airy to dark and foreboding. \"Bits and Pieces\" and \"Skyline\" feel like James Bond vs. Stomp. \"Special Delivery\" provides a harrowing climactic vibe, while \"Finale\" suitably closes the score with a sonic blast of awesomeness that will make you want to start listening to the thing all over again.   Halo 3: ODST 's score is an ambient masterpiece, positively dripping with mood. It's an enjoyable standalone listen, but even more affective when heard while stalking the streets of New Mombasa at night.  A brief word of warning: Apple's iTunes is inexplicably charging $19.99 for the soundtrack when it can be had for much cheaper elsewhere. Shop around. This one's worth buying, even if you don't play the game.",

        "Content": "More than any other game to date, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune seems to define the PlayStation 3. Naughty Dog's 2007 jungle romp starring the one and only Nathan Drake gave gamers a taste of what it would be like to play as an acrobatically-inclined Indiana Jones. With stunning visuals (that still rank amongst the best in gaming today), a fantastically told story, great puzzles and high-octane gunplay, it's easily one of the best titles of this console generation. Now Naughty Dog returns to the spotlight with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves . Both expectedly and amazingly, Naughty Dog has indeed bested Nate's first adventure and has created a sequel that is not only bigger and better in practically every way, but also packs a multiplayer component that could be released as its own separate, full-priced game and people would stand in line to hand over their cash. Yes, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is fantastic. Trying to remain as spoiler-free as possible, I'll just say that the story starts off about a year or so after the events of the first game and begins with Nate and a few fellow thieves working on finding Marco Polo's lost treasure fleet. Of course, things aren't quite that simple and the cast winds up going on a much grander adventure, one that takes them half-way around the world. That's about as far as I want to go with the storyline, though some of the trailers out there actually reveal a little more than that. The important part here though is that this game doesn't just take place on a single island and instead changes locales a handful of times over the course of the adventure. The result is that the pacing feels better and faster, and even though you're technically doing the same sort of shooting, climbing and puzzle solving throughout the game, the different ways the scenes are presented gives Among Thieves a greater sense of gameplay variety than the original. The great storytelling extends to the character development, which has been turned up a good notch or two. Almost everyone with more than two lines of dialogue has an interesting reason for doing what they're doing (though the main bad guy is just bad), and the way that everyone interacts with one another is realistic and interesting. Almost every character is unpredictable in some way, but not in a forced or unnatural manner. The story itself twists and turns throughout the course of the game, as you might expect, and for the most part it's a solid tale. Nate and his pals go through a lot, so it does a good job of reeling you in and keeping you hooked until the end. While I'd say the story is quite good overall, I wouldn't say that it's perfect. Without giving anything away, while most of the story has solid footing in real-world lore and legend, it does start to veer away from this at some point in a way that could have been handled better. Still, it's told very, very well through the use of fantastic cutscenes and acting, and will keep you guessing at what'll happen until the very end. As for the gameplay itself, Uncharted 2 -- like the original Drake's Fortune -- tasks you with gunfights, environmental navigation or puzzle solving. While a lot of the mechanics are identical to the first title, everything has been blended together a little better, especially the combat and navigation. This is in large part due to the settings that you'll fight in. Whereas the first game generally had you walk into an area with lots of cover, set up behind a wall and then take guys out as best you could, Uncharted 2 offers a lot more variety and options in how these sequences play out thanks to the fantastic level design. Rather than fighting on flat ground, almost every battle scene features multiple levels and areas to use to your advantage. If you want to stay on the ground and take guys out the old fashioned way, you're more than welcome to. But you can also climb to higher ground and use height to your advantage, or flank the enemy by moving from cover to cover and changing your tactics as the battle unfolds around you. While the game is still very much a linear tale, taking you from point to specific point, you're offered many more options in how you approach and deal with battles. One thing that plays a big part in this is that stealth is a much more prominent element of the game, and it's actually a very useful tactic to take advantage of when you approach a situation. If an enemy doesn't see you and you attack him, you'll perform a silent stealth takedown. While you could do similar things in the original game, the way that it's implemented and the way sections are set up allow you to actually use it well. There are a couple spots in the game where I took down four or five enemies before the gunfire starting whizzing around, greatly improving my chances of survival. It's even possible to avoid a big fight entirely if you can clear an area of enemies silently as there won't be anyone around to call in for reinforcements. Of course, you don't have to use any stealth at all if you just want to start popping caps when you roll into a fight. Well, that is except for a sequence near the start of the game where you have to be stealthy as you're not allowed to be seen or outright kill anyone. The problem here is that your route isn't as obvious as it could be and you only need to, and perhaps are even realistically able to, take down three or four guys out of a room packed to the gills with guards. If you don't do things in a fairly specific order, you'll fail and have to restart. The most problematic bit here is that two enemies that you can take down are in tricky spots. One that you have to take down hangs out near a banister that's only a little higher than you stand. You can't just grab him because he's too high up, and half the time that I'd jump up to grab the ledge I would wind up startling him. If you know exactly what you're doing here then you could get through this sequence in about a minute or so, but due to its trial-and-error nature, I was probably stuck here for a good 15 or 20 minutes before moving on. But fortunately, everything after this is smooth sailing. In fact, this is one of those rare games that keeps getting better and better as it goes on. The first half felt like a nice -- if somewhat subtle -- improvement in the gameplay department over the original, but once you hit the half-way point, everything kicks into full swing and you start getting into jaw-dropping sequences. However, one complaint that we had with the first game is still present here: you'll get to rooms of enemies where soldiers just keep on coming, wave after wave. Now, from a design and technical standpoint this solution makes sense because if you started in a room with 30 guys already present, you'd never have an opening to fire back as you would just be pelted with constant gunfire. But, it's still a little aggravating to get into a fight, clear the room and then have a half-dozen more guys walk in and start shooting up the place. Perhaps if the battles weren't as concentrated in single rooms and you would have to continue to fight as you moved down hallways this would feel a little more realistic, but it is what it is. So, aside from that, the combat is improved and nicely makes use of your climbing abilities. Similarly, though the mechanics are essentially unchanged, the bits of the game where you have to scale the environment are taken up a level as well. The sequences where you're solely focused on navigating the world are usually visually stunning, and some even incorporate moving bits that make you think about where you're going. It's hard to explain why it's better than the original title without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that during a number of these segments, even though I'd be doing essentially the same stuff that I did in the last game, I found myself in awe of what and where I was climbing. Great stuff. My only real complaint, which is a forced one that I'm just mentioning to put it out there, is that the climbing paths are still very linear, and from what I was able to tell, there's only one way through most every section. If you're somewhere and there isn't a door, you know that you need to look around for something that you can grab to begin climbing. It's sort of a, \"well, I don't know where this'll take me, but it's the only thing I can do\" sort of scenario. Again, this isn't really a complaint that I'm knocking the game for, but in the future it would be nice to either have multiple ways to get somewhere, or a more sensible reason for climbing up bricks that I can just happen to scale. The third piece of the Uncharted puzzle is, well, puzzles. The first title blended action, climbing and puzzle solving in great fashion, and though it's handled differently this time around, Naughty Dog has solved the equation perfectly again. Whereas it seems to me like there are less puzzles this time, the ones that you do come across are complicated and very involved. Instead of peppering small interactive quizzes throughout the game, you'll come to roomfuls of things to solve, many of which are multi-staged puzzles. What's cool is that instead of having Sir Francis Drake's journal, Nate keeps his own this time around that you can freely flip through. And you'll need to, as some puzzles require multiple pages of clues. One in particular referenced a good four or five pages of the book, so you need to look at what's going on, flip through the book, do some stuff and then go back to the book again. It doesn't feel forced, and due to the intricacies therein, I felt more accomplished when I passed them. Great stuff here. One thing that I didn't touch on when I was talking about combat was the AI. Those of you who played the original (and if you haven't, head to the store ASAP) know that Nate was up against some very smart foes. They'd take cover, use grenades well and were generally fun to fight because of this. For better or worse, things are about the same this time around. Honestly, I didn't really expect an obvious improvement because they were already so good, so that's actually praise rather than a complaint. I will say though that the AI continues to make great use of the environment even though it's generally way more complicated this time around, which is great. Now, while the opponent AI was already impressive, your companion AI is absolutely phenomenal. You're almost always with someone else this time around, which was something that I was a little concerned about when I had originally heard this as friendly AI almost always gets in the way. Not here, and not ever. It really feels like they're with you rather than in your way, thinking for themselves and doing stuff that real people would do. If there are climbing sequences, the computer will either quickly go ahead or stay back and wait for you to pass it first. If there's a gunfight, it'll find its own cover, take care of itself and stay out of your way. The only time in the game that I thought the AI did something that I wasn't pleased with was once when I came to a room where two factions where fighting, we were hidden in cover and I wanted to wait the battle out. After staying quiet for about 30 seconds and playing along, Chloe popped up and joined the battle, dragging me into it as well. That's it. During the other ten hours of the adventure, of which a good eight-plus is spent with someone at your side, they were always complementary rather than hurtful and often actually very helpful. It's impossible to talk about Uncharted 2 without mentioning its visuals. I've already touched on the fantastic presentation in the cutscenes, but there are some scenes that you'll play in that will have your jaw on the floor. The world is packed with bits of detail that do nothing for gameplay, but do a lot to draw you into the world and make you feel like this is a real place. The texture detail is astounding, the amount of random stuff everywhere is mind boggling, the lighting is some of the best we've ever seen and the overall art direction is phenomenal. And of course, let me not forget to mention the amazing animation, killer explosions and pretty much every other pixel on the screen. It's kind of amazing to say this, but the actual gameplay oftentimes looks better than the cutscenes. This is truly one of the best looking games that I've ever seen, and you could easily argue that it's the best overall on the PlayStation 3 (when you can argue that against the likes of Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4, well, that's saying something). So that's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves in a large nutshell. Or is it? Yes indeed, this time around Naughty Dog went out of its way to include an online component, one that features both versus and cooperative gameplay. To say that the multiplayer is fun would be a massive understatement. For my money, this is one of the best multiplayer experiences that you'll find in any game around, and considering that the single-player portion alone is enough to easily warrant your $60, well, this almost feels like Naughty Dog has given us an extra game for free. The list of options and features here is immense. For competitive play you get a good variety of modes including stuff like team deathmatch, elimination, capture the flag (or treasure in this case), a zone control mode and more. You can gain ranks, which then in turn allows you to buy perks (like the ability to hold more ammo or reload faster) with money that you earn while playing. Levels here are scenes adapted from the single-player game, so you're getting the same fantastic design elements with lots of spots to take advantage of, places to hide and use for cover, and so on and so forth. .For the cooperative stuff, you have a handful of options here. A survival mode is exactly what it sounds like - you and a couple friends hole up in a spot and take out wave after wave of enemies that get progressively tougher for as long as you can. It's fun and very challenging, but for my money the meat here is the co-op mode. Rather than playing through the entire game with a couple friends, you instead jump into specific scenarios that have you save some folks, grab a treasure or something straightforward like that. However, it's quite a bit different than what you'll come across in the single-player game as enemies don't just pop up in front of you, they come from everywhere , quickly and in large numbers. You absolutely must communicate here (using a headset is key to winning) and you have to constantly check your surroundings lest you be shot point-blank in the back of the head with a shotgun. There's a lot to the strategy for every mode of multiplayer offered in Uncharted 2, but I don't really need to delve into any of that because it all plays exactly like the single-player game, which is fantastic news. For a game that relies so much on environmental traversal to be able to offer the same exact mechanics while playing online, Naughty Dog has really tied everything together brilliantly. If you like to get up high and drop down on your opponents in the single-player game, you can do that online. If you like to stealthily flank guys online and take them out silently, you can do that in the single-player game. The multiplayer is both a massive and natural extension of the single-player experience, and the fact that Naughty Dog was able to pull it off so seamlessly is applause-worthy."

        "Content": "Put down your torches and pitchforks, stop shouting in the streets and step back inside to grab your wallet and boot up the Wii Shop -- because after another lengthy span of less-than-stellar releases for the retro download service, the Virtual Console is worth caring about once again. This time around the reprieve from the on-going assault of below-average \"classics\" comes courtesy of a milestone, as today marks two and a half years of the VC's existence and the arrival of its 300th title here in the States. And Nintendo couldn't have picked a better game to herald the event, as today we're finally getting The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask .  Majora's Mask is a classic installment in the Zelda franchise, an instant hit with fans and critics alike when it first debuted around eight and a half years ago on the Nintendo 64. There, it became the second Zelda game on that particular console -- placed as a follow-up to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , and also serving as a storyline sequel to the events in that masterpiece. But even though Ocarina was a nearly impossible act to follow, Majora's Mask still managed to shine in its shadow -- thanks, in large part, to its completely unique design concept and its darker overall tone.  As Majora's Mask begins, we find our young hero Link on a lonesome quest -- he's lost his fairy friend Navi, and is searching a mysterious forest for signs of where she's gone. Suddenly, though, he and his horse Epona are attacked by a cackling, maniacal assailant -- the masked, mad and unpredictable Skull Kid. Link soon finds himself swept up into a chase to follow after the villain, but it proves a bit too successful -- he catches up with Skull Kid, only to have his newest enemy turn on him, curse him by transforming him into a lowly Deku Scrub, and retreat into an alternate reality of Hyrule known as Termina.   The face of fear.  It's an engaging introduction to an epic adventure, as you're immediately introduced to one of the core new play mechanics in Majora's Mask -- transformations. In his cursed Deku form, Link is shorter than ever, deprived of his sword and seemingly helpless. But he finds that he's able to access new methods of attack like a whirlwind spin and a bubble-blowing burst -- and he's able to take advantage of special Deku flowers in key locations to launch into the air and fly with a helicopter made of spinning flower petals.  The curse turns out to be a blessing, especially after you've managed to \"heal\" Link and turn the Deku spirit into a mask. Then, as an item in your inventory, it can be called upon at any time to solve puzzles, navigate flower-filled, flight-demanding rooms in dungeons, and even infiltrate Deku Scrub societies.  Other transformations come into Link's possession later on, too, including a Goron form that allows him to punch out enemies with huge, pounding fists and roll into a spike-shelled boulder for faster travel across the land than even Epona can provide, and also a Zora form that gives our hero the ability to swim like a torpedo and fire boomerang-like fins from his arms. You'll also amass a whole wealth of other masks that don't trigger total transformations, but are nonetheless incredibly useful -- like the Bunny Hood, which doubles normal Link's running speed, and the Bremen Mask, which lets you take command of chickens like some kind of Pied Piper.  The masks mechanic is so deep and involved that, by itself, it probably would have been enough to build this entire adventure on. But, this time, Link transforming back and forth into four different forms isn't even the most important new addition to the design here -- that distinction goes to time itself.  Looming up in the sky above the land of Termina is an enormous, grinning moon. And it's getting closer. And closer. And closer still. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is played under the constant watch of this massive, intimidating heavenly body and it's constantly moving nearer to a cataclysmic impact with the planet's surface below -- it's set to crash down and end all life in Termina in just three days.  Majora's Mask is played, then, with a constant and continuous countdown clock ticking ever closer to the end of the world, all the time. It's a freaky thing, and gives the game a feeling of tension and sense of urgency unmatched by any other Zelda series installment -- you can't just waste time, wandering around, doing nothing. You have to be on the move, all the time.   Taking flight.  Now you don't just have 72 in-game hours to finish the entire quest -- Link ultimately discovers ways to slow the countdown down, and to reset events back to the beginning of The First Day by playing songs on his ocarina. But any changes you've made in the world always get reset, too, when you travel back in time -- if you save a citizen of Termina's central city Clock Town from some disaster, then warp back in time, they won't be saved any more.  And there's nothing you can do about it. The game has so many different activities and events for you to take part in over the course of the same three days that it's actually impossible to be everywhere and do everything -- you'll always miss something. You'll never save everybody.  It's that dismal reality that fuels the darker overall tone of the story in Majora's Mask, and what makes this Zelda game ultimately so compelling in contrast to the rest of the series -- you can ultimately achieve a happy ending and save the world of Termina from destruction, but along the way you'll be forced to realize that you can't be everyone's hero all the time. Sacrifices must be made.  Now, before wrapping things up here, we could go into greater detail about the rest of Majora's Mask's gameplay -- but beyond those two major new mechanics, it's 3D Zelda as you know and love. Exploring the overworld, locating dungeons. Discovering new items and songs for your ocarina that open up other, previously inaccessible areas of the game map. Beating bosses, increasing your life meter with heart containers and all the rest. It's true Zelda. It's just darker than usual, with haunting transformations and the end of the world hovering, literally, in plain view above you all the time."

        "Content": "Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series is easily the epitome of the open world \"sandbox\" game design. Other studios have tried to capture that same vibe in their own titles with various levels of success, but for better or worse none have been able to dethrone GTA as the game that's synonymous with the open world genre. So when Rockstar branches out its series in new directions, you take notice: Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a GTA game specifically tailored for the Nintendo DS platform, and while the Nintendo DS may be the weakest current generation system in terms of hardware power, Rockstar doesn't let that get in the way of producing one of the deepest and extremely fulfilling chapters in the Grand Theft Auto saga.  We've already seen handheld renditions of the Grand Theft Auto open-world design: the PlayStation Portable has supported two games in the series that came extremely close to the quality of the PlayStation 2 renditions. The same team responsible for the PSP versions hunkered down to build a unique GTA experience for the Nintendo DS platform and succeeds admirably. GTA: Chinatown Wars might shift some things around and pair the big picture down, but the scope remains the same: it's a tremendous game, both in scale and in fun.  Chinatown Wars opens with Huang Lee on his way to Liberty City to deliver a symbolic sword to his Uncle Kenny. Huang's father, a Triad boss, was mysteriously slain and this sword must pass from his possession to his brother. Unfortunately for Huang, he's ambushed upon arrival, his sword stolen, and he's tossed for dead into the harbor. That's where the player begins their Liberty City underworld career on the Nintendo DS. The story takes some bobs, weaves, twists and turns in the single-player campaign, and we'll leave the surprises for you to discover on your own. No spoilers here.     What isn't a spoiler is the gameplay: Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is tried-and-true GTA design. Rockstar Leeds took nearly every aspect of the console design and jammed it into a Nintendo DS cartridge, tweaking the presentation to fit the restrictions and limitations of the Nintendo hardware. The camera returns to a top-down perspective in similar fashion to the classic Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2. It's similar but it's not the same: though the viewpoint is above the action, the visuals down below are nearly entirely 3D: buildings, cars, obstacles are fully rendered in 3D, and this is important to note because objects interact and react in the same way as they would in the latest renditions of the series: cars flip, jump and tumble if you're a little wild on the gas pedal; light poles topple over into traffic. So while the game may take a different direction in the way it's presented, the gameplay is entirely current-generation GTA.  Liberty City tends to evolve with each game Rockstar creates, but for Chinatown Wars the DS development team matched up its version of the city with Grand Theft Auto's metropolis pretty closely. The DS city is still its own layout with its own back alleys, shortcuts, and bypasses, but the game retains the regional \"boroughs\" idea, and the entire city is open from the start for players to explore at their own leisure.  The way to explore the city is pretty much what made Grand Theft Auto such an addictive design. If you see a car, simply take it and drive \u2013 there may be some repercussions for your thievery but anything with wheels is yours to have. In the DS game there are several dozen different vehicles roaming around and parked in the city, and each of these vehicles has distinct handling \u2013 they're not the same model with a different skin. Vans are heavy and cumbersome, bikes are light and peppy. It's common to find yourself losing hours jacking the different cars just to see how each one feels as you zip through the city streets.  Of course, you can simply walk the avenues and alleyways, and in Chinatown Wars you'll be doing a lot of that in the various missions that require more guns than gas. The Nintendo DS has just as huge a focus on weaponry as Grand Theft Auto 4 \u2013 pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers are all available from the tried-and-true Ammunation merchant, and players use a \"lock on\" system to target the enemies (or bystanders) and take them down with rapid-fire ease. It might be a little too easy at times, though \u2013 the controls will take a bit of getting used to, but once you learn the lock-on system you'll probably find ways to exploit the system to make missions a bit of a cakewalk.   Where the cellphone was GTA IV's tool of the trade, the PDA is Chinatown Wars'. Anything and everything you do in the DS version of GTA revolves around your touch-screen personal data assistant: GPS waypoint selection, weapons ordering, email tracking. The system is designed extremely well and makes it easy to move from place to place within Liberty City: if you receive an email from one of the many characters you meet up with, you can simply tap on the link at the bottom of the note to link their location on the GPS to find them easily.  This system works extremely well for the game's new addition: the drug trading element. Much of the economics of Chinatown Wars revolve around buying and selling drugs all over the city \u2013 you buy low, and sell high. Throughout your life in Liberty City you'll befriend drug dealers, and many times they'll hit you up with tips of where the bargains and the most needy dealers are in the city. The trading is integrated so well within Chinatown Wars that it's more than a mini-game, and you'll find much of your time will be dedicated to driving all over town finding where the best deals are. Of course, surprise drug busts could end your dealings right quick, and all that time could be lost if you're pounced by the fuzz. Good thing you can store an overstock of goods back at your hideaways.  There are other DS-centric elements peppered all over the GTA experience. Some cars aren't as easy to jack and may need a little grunt work: wrenching, hot wiring the ignition, or hacking the theft deterrent system might be necessary, and that could be a real drag if you're running from the cops and pick the wrong vehicle for your getaway. Driving through a tollbooth without dropping coins into the basket might trigger an undesired wanted level. Gate locks will need to be cut, explosives will need to be positioned\u2026all through the use of the touch screen. It might seem like these are all unnecessary gimmicks, but after a few surprises along the way your stylus begins to feel like a tool of the underworld trade as you pull it out and put it away.     What doesn't work well on the touch screen: lobbing grenades and other projectiles. If you want to toss one out, you need to tap the stylus onto the icon and slide it around the radius to lob it in a 360 degree fashion. If the mission calls for tossing explosive weapons exclusively, then it works and works well. But it's very cumbersome to be in a firefight with the normal weapons and reach down to throw a grenade. If you use your fat thumb to do it instead of the stylus, you might find that you've accidentally dropped it at your feet. Whoops.  We do miss the fully animated, acted cutscenes of the console and PSP Grand Theft Autos, and we'd much rather have those than the somewhat rushed, visually awkward comic book-and-text dialogue intermissions that are in Chinatown Wars. It's very difficult to read the attitudes of all the various characters in the game, and the sarcastic nature of the personalities don't come through in the text nearly as well as they could have if they were professionally voice acted.  And the music, while decent in its own right, definitely lacks the punch of a licensed soundtrack with the humor of fake commercials interspersed. At least the writers had fun putting the jokes in the e-mail system.   But we understand the limitations that the Nintendo DS put forth: the cartridge medium isn't very friendly to the extensive GTA design. But Rockstar Leeds did an outstanding job in every other way. Though the game doesn't look as eyepopping gorgeous as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 GTA titles \u2013 and it's not even up as high as the PSP editions, either \u2013 Chinatown Wars' visuals are outstanding for Nintendo DS standards and shouldn't be dismissed in the GTA comparisons. The 3D engine runs 30 frames per second almost the entire time, only slowing down when the screen fills to the brim with cops during the intense three or four star wanted levels. You really have to appreciate the little things in the game: the physics engine in particular is really excellent and breathes life into the action as you knock over structures or send your vehicle off a jump into the drink.  Watch out for the stray bug in Chinatown Wars: in our 20 hour playthrough we encountered two glitches, both involving the game's object scripting that required us to quit and restart. Luckily the DS game saves frequently and it was only a minor inconvenience to get back to the start of the mission and try again, glitch-free.  One of the coolest additions to the GTA design is Chinatown Wars' updated wanted system: instead of evading the cops to lose the stars you've earned, you now have to aggressively go after the police vehicles and disable them by your skillful driving. It's an element that really adds a level of offense and intensity, and it's incredibly rewarding to coax a cop to slam itself into the wall of a building with a satisfying dead siren sound effect. Don't be surprised if you see this element added to the next generation of GTA games.     The story's over in 15 hours depending on how little or how much you're distracted by the little things in Liberty City (gambling with the scratch tickets were our bane), but even when the tale's over there's still plenty to do in town. You've got races, you've got drug trading, you've got side missions, you've got Rampage mini-games, you've got hidden security cameras to destroy. Everything you do in Liberty City is tracked, and you can upload the stats to Rockstar's Social Club and compare your scores with friends. New missions will also unlock using the online function of Chinatown Wars. There's also a multiplayer aspect if you connect locally with friends, so you've got plenty of gameplay in Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.  Multiplayer is a huge aspect of the GTA: Chinatown Wars, but requires multiple copies of the game to take advantage of the various game modes. As many as four players can enter the competitive options, which include standard races as well as a \"capture the flag\" style mode where you race for a Van hidden in the city and drive it back to your base. There's also a cooperative \"Defend the Base\" mode. Each of these options are easily more fun with more players -- try to gather a nice crowd before taking part in the wireless multiplayer. It's unfortunate that these modes aren't online, but considering what's going on in the games -- and the DS restrictions -- it's understandable."

        "Content": "Zen Bound is a magical game that confirms every hope for the App Store becoming fertile ground for incredible new gameplay ideas that would never gain traction elsewhere. Sometimes it's too easy to heap hyperbole on a fresh concept just because it does something unexpected. But Zen Bound deserves its superlatives. This is one of the best games you can buy for your iPhone.  Zen Bound is a very tactile game. You are given a series of wooden figurines and a length of string. Winding the string around the ornament lays down tracks of paint. You must paint a specific amount of the figurine's surface to move on to the next puzzle. When a stage begins, the string is tied to a nail on the figurine and stretched taut by an off-screen hand. You manipulate the figure with your finger, spinning and rotating it to wrap the string around it. However, due to the angles of some surprisingly complex ornaments, you must also tilt the iPhone to change the \"direction\" of the incoming string. You can unravel the string if necessary, but this lifts the paint. When you finally have met the requirement for the figurine, you sever the string by scraping it against a nail.   So very zen. I fear my gameplay description doesn't do it justice. There is an intangible to Zen Bound. Perhaps its best described as the sensation of discovery because at some point, the Zen Bound moves out of the \"game\" category and becomes an experience, kind of like Flower on the PS3. Yes, there is a technical structure to the game -- lay down a certain percentage of paint -- but Zen Bound is bigger than that. It is really is a part of a movement to redefine exactly what a game is.  In keeping with the \"zen\" part of its title, Zen Bound makes sure to include plenty of no pressure gameplay. There are indeed challenges with rigid requirements, but the main game is about experimentation with the strings and ornaments. The real fun is in figuring out exactly how to best paint a figurine without some threatening time limit. Manipulating the ornament to get into those little crevices, like a mouth or the crook of a tail, is a real joy.  The game has an aura around it, thanks in no small part to its brilliant presentation. The figurines actually look carved out of wood and the paint patterns are perfectly chosen. The puzzle selection screen is a cherry tree with Japanese lanterns and wooden tags that represent each stage. It's really quite breathtaking, especially when paired with the game's phenomenal soundtrack which is both intriguing and soothing. Listen to it through headphones for the best effect. There's even a link in the game to download it for free.   Zen Bound was reviewed with version 1.0.",

        "Content": "Ever since I first learned about Empire: Total War at the German Games Convention in 2007, it's been at the top of my most-wanted list. Creative Assembly's Total War is one of the most compelling historical strategy series in the PC catalog, so it's fair to say that my expectations were high. We've been playing the final version for over a week now and can say that, with the exception of a few rough spots, this game has succeeded in creating an immensely engaging experience that captures the grand national strategies and battlefield tactics of the 18th century. And though it refines several elements of the Total War formula, it also offers up several new surprises. If you've been out of the loop altogether on this one, Empire combines the thoughtful turn-based grand strategy of 4X games with the urgent intensity of real time historical tactical games. Players alternate between the roles of national leader and battlefield commander. One moment you'll be setting tax policies, paying for dock construction and negotiating alliances. The next moment, you'll be on the field of battle, maneuvering your infantry lines and ordering massive cavalry charges. Empire focuses that action on Europe and the two colonial theaters of North America and India in the 18th century.  Despite the numerous additions to the series, Total War veterans will feel right at home here, and the numerous tool tips and tutorial messages will explain how the new elements of Empire fit within the existing scheme. The new Road to Independence campaign begins with a series of limited, scripted objectives that will guide you through some of the basic concepts of the game, from fighting off a Native raiding party at the start, to waging battles on the campaign map, to using ships to move your land units around obstacles. After the first handful of missions in the new campaign, you're dropped into the American theater, where you'll learn some of the finer points of empire management. Though I'm strictly a grand campaign kind of player, I found a lot to love about the more directed experience of the Road to Independence campaign. First, the storytelling and overall presentation is excellent. The cutscenes establish a firm context for the battles, and makes them more than just isolated exercises in strategic thinking. There's a considerable emotional element as well; that first shot of the American flags at Bunker Hill really got to me. Knowing how the battle turns out, it was especially motivating and helped to put me in the right mood when, with only one army and one city, I'm asked to secure the entire seaboard from Georgia to Maine The Grand Campaign doesn't have as many emotionally effective story elements but it does benefit from a much wider scope, in terms of both time and geographic area. Here players will have the chance to lead one of the main powers of Europe through the entire 18th century. Leaders of each nation will have to consider war and peace, trade and taxation, government and technology, infrastructure and recruitment, alliances and expansion, and a host of other competing national priorities. And with several other major powers (and many more lesser ones) competing for the same resources, armed conflict is inevitable.  Whether you compete in Europe, India or the Americas is up to you. Each playable nation has their own unique starting situation and the game weighs the requirements for victory based on the resources and challenges you have at the start. England, for instance, will need to develop a strong navy to protect her shores. While this might leave her unable to field a large enough army to compete for glory on the European mainland, she have ample opportunity to exploit the uncertain situations in North America and India to create a large overseas empire. Austria's situation in central Europe requires a different approach. With Ottoman invasions threatening the South and Prussian ambitions quickly growing in the North, she needs to field large armies and maintain reliable alliances. The nations all have a number of specific territories they must capture in order to claim victory, which gives the game a bit of direction. The English, for instance, need to hold Gibraltar, Egypt, Malta, and a couple of other specific territories in order to win when the 200th turn ends in 1799. They also need to obtain a number of extra provinces of their choosing. Even then, there are some short term goals for the English. If they can strike out against the French in Canada and take out the Cherokee in the south, the entire colonial protectorate, from the Carolinas up through Maine, will merge with the British empire. The victory conditions can be scaled back for a shorter game, but even this lasts a full 100 turns, so it's likely to take at least a day or two, and longer if you want to make the most of each of your strategic decisions. In terms of finding the right balance for your empire, things are a bit more complicated than in previous Total Wars. Medieval 2 asked players to shift each province towards support of the military or the economy, but Empire takes things much further than that. Each territory is dominated by a single regional capital that you can upgrade with better barracks, theaters or government houses, but there are also a number of outlying resources you'll need to develop as well. You might have a province that contains a farm, or an iron mine, or a port, and you'll need to spend money to develop these in specific ways. One port might be focused on fishing, for instance, while another could focus on trade or shipbuilding. As a region develops, new towns will spring up nearby and they can be upgraded with tech-researching colleges. So each region will have a number of smaller towns and farms within it that can be targeted by your enemies. The good news is that the developers have increased the complexity of the strategic mode without necessarily increasing the management burden. To be sure, the game does require a lot of time and attention of the player, and the later stages of the game still bog down in lots of repetitive administrative tasks, but this time around many of the most tedious and time-consuming tasks have been streamlined tremendously. When one of your regional areas can be improved, you'll see a small golden hammer spinning above it. Better still, when you select a regional improvement, you can scroll through all the corresponding areas in your empire and upgrade them at once. This is a particularly useful feature if you happen to have researched a new farm technology and want to put it into practice throughout your empire.  There's a lot more going on in Empire, but the map is clear and easy to read. Trade has been simplified now so you won't be marching merchants all around the map. Now trade is handled through the development of trading posts that let you buy improved facilities that produce the goods you need for trade. In order to trade them with other nations, you simply have to use the diplomacy screen to open up a general trading agreement. Once that's done the AI handles the rest, shuttling your goods off by land and sea and selling them for profit. Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't some compelling ways to interact with the trade system. Because the goods are transported along specific routes, you can see where the goods are flowing. Mouse over a trading line and you'll even see how much cash it's generating for each nation that's using it. From there it's a simply matter to drop your fleets on a trade route (or even blockade an enemy port) to keep the cash from reaching your enemies. There are also a few separate trading theaters in the game and you'll need to use your navies to claim and protect them. If you manage to claim a few spots along the Ivory Coast or the coast of Brazil, you can park your merchant ships there and begin raking in the cash. In all it's a much more active kind of trading system that focuses more on direct conflict and competition between the players than on the boring placement of merchants in previous Total War games. And because of the added importance that fleets play in this new system, the naval side of the game is considerably more interesting and influential than before.  Naval battles look amazing, but their strategic significance is just as important. With the merchants removed from the game, the diplomats followed. Diplomacy is now controlled through a single interface that lets you negotiate with other nations any time you want. You no longer need to dispatch a diplomat in order to talk to another country. And with so many interactions going on at once and so much distance between the nations involved, it's a welcome change. Unfortunately, as convenient as the whole affair is, there are still some options that are missing and some strange balance issues. For one thing, it seems that your own success inspires other nations to hate you, and I've found that it's harder to make friends when I'm doing well than it is when I've got my back against the wall. Secondly, the AI never really comes back with a counterproposal when they reject an offer, so players aren't ever really going to be sure what they need to do to sweeten the pot. Spies, called Rakes here, seem to have managed to stay in the game somehow, despite their limited utility. I like the idea of having distinct spy units on the map to infiltrate enemy cities and assassinate rival generals, but their ability to gather information or to turn the tide of a battle seems a bit too limited. We almost rather would have seen a system like that in Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword where players simply fund an overall espionage effort against a rival and then slowly acquire more intelligence over time. There are plenty of other ways the game has smoothed out the rougher spots of empire management. Taxes are now controlled across the entire empire by a single pair of sliders, one for the nobility and one for the commoners, so you won't need to go through each and every province, setting their tax levels independently. The tax screen even shows you the levels of unrest across your entire empire, so you'll be able to tell if high taxes are a problem. If you require a bit of fine-tuning, then you can go to the most riotous provinces and simply exempt them from taxes altogether until things stabilize. Your fleets and armies and agents are all shown in a single list now that you can check to make sure that each and every element in your military has been given orders. The lists not only shows where the unit is and how much movement it has left, but also gives you a chance to jump straight to that unit. That way you won't waste time searching and searching for a province called Moose Factory. There's less shuffling of troops overall now, thanks to the ability to recruit units at the armies themselves. If you order reinforcements at an army, those orders will be transmitted to nearby towns and the newly created units will march automatically to the recruiting army. It's not a fast process, but it definitely removes a lot of the time the player used to spend doing it all by hand. Rome: Total War opened up the provinces so players could move armies all through a territory, seizing passes and bypassing unimportant forts to get at the real objectives. Since Empire introduces meaningful structures outside of the regional capital, there's more of an opportunity to raid an enemy province without ever touching the capital. You can simply march in, burn down a farm, capture a mine, or eject his ships from a port.  You can still beseige towns, but battles in Empire take place in varied settings. Because these battles aren't so focused on the main strongholds, you'll find that Empire offers a lot more battles out in the open than we've ever seen in the series before. The previous games always seemed to progress from siege to siege as the enemies you were fighting always preferred to fight from behind their strongholds. This new focus on battles in the countryside also means a lot more variety in terms of locations as well. You might be fighting over a field of square farm plots, or beside a small native settlement or against the backdrop of a small college town. When you throw in the spectacular time of day and weather effects, it really makes each battlefield feel unique. As deep as the grand strategy of Empire is, the battlefield action is just as thrilling in an entirely different way. You'll maneuver your infantry lines around the battlefield and fire volley after volley at your enemies or fix bayonets for a melee clash. Meanwhile, your artillery are parked high on a hill behind your lines, sending cannon fire crashing into enemy formations. Your cavalry might be preparing for a massive charge to break a weak spot in the enemy's lines, or they might be circling around to take the enemy artillery batteries unaware. Rangers could be crouching in the forests, waiting to spring an ambush, while musketeers are garrisoned in a nearby house that gives them not only a field of view of an approaching enemy unit, but also a bit of protection as well. The combination of brutality and panache that characterizes the warfare of this period is well represented here and presented in a way that captures the cinematic brilliance of it all without ever falling back on obvious exaggerations or pretense. It's one thing to appreciate the reloading animation of the artillery crews or the puffs of smoke from musket volleys, but watching soldiers actually get trampled under the hooves of horses while other members of the line vault over fences to get out of the way really brings the battles to life in a way that exceeds even the high standard set by the previous games in the series. The animations are spot on, and the varied appearances of your soldiers lend a real sense of life to the game.  The sights and sounds of battle are wonderfully recreated here. Things have improved in terms of gameplay as well. The formation controls work much better now, thanks particularly to the addition of locked groupings that allow you to maintain the relative positions of different units when you move them or change their facing. It's not always easy to place your large groups on the sometimes irregular terrain you'll find in Empire, but the interface makes it easy to make adjustments on the fly. The interface is less obtrusive than in previous games but still offers access to all the same commands for movements, attacks and formation changes. There are also plenty of new commands, like ordering your artillery to fire at the geography itself, so you can take out unoccupied buildings and even fire in front of an enemy formation to stop them from advancing. There's also a slew of new military upgrades you can research that will allow you to build trenches, fire with the bayonets attached, and even build protective walls around your artillery pieces. The battlefield AI shows a keen grasp of all these new features and will definitely keep you on your toes, even when you have the advantage. Another big change in Empire is the addition of full naval battles. This was the main selling point for the game when we first heard about it, because it was an element that had been neglected in previous games in the series and because it was such an important part of the time period that Empire covers. First, we should say that the sea battles in Empire are visually stunning. The presence of men actively working on the decks, the flutter of the sails and rigging, the natural motion of the water, and the incredible explosion of flame and splinters when the cannons strike their targets make the naval battles every bit as visually pleasing as the land battles. There's nothing like positioning the camera low to the deck or the water and getting a sense of what the battles must look like from the viewpoint of a participant. There's a gripping game there as well. Trying to line your ships up correctly, making the most of the wind and choosing your targets appropriately is very rewarding, particularly when the outcome is factored into your larger plans on the campaign map. Losing the protecting force of your naval invasion is a bitter, bitter blow. The controls are relatively simple with options to set sail state, shot type and lock into formations.  Fleets are more than just ferries now and can significantly impact your economy. However, the formations and pathfinding leave a lot be desired. We've ordered ships to form into line astern and had them simply all turn 180 degrees and head off in the opposite direction from the enemy. Even trying to set separate targets and move paths for your ships can sometimes lead to chaotic routes that actually change from second to second during the course of the battle. I understand that factors like wind direction, turning rate and the presence of other ships makes it tough to plot an accurate course during a crowded battle, but on those occasions where the system breaks down, it can leave you completely confused as to what your ships are even attempting to do. Of course, battles are heard as much as seen, and Empire doesn't disappoint there either. The roar of the cannons and the clash of sabers and bayonets are more than enough to lend an air of realism to the game. Tramping boots and the shouts of your men add another dimension to the combat as well, but for some reason, the infantry sound like a cavalry charge on my machine. Maybe I just have the bass up too high on my speakers, but it is a little distracting. In any case, it's worth paying attention to the details. If you listen carefully enough, you'll even notice that all the armies speak in their native languages. The music fits the martial tone of the game perfectly and definitely helps players get into the mood for the setting. As you might expect, Empire Total War is a bit of a system hog, so you'll need a fairly powerful machine to get the most out of it. I've been running it mostly on a Quad 2.66GHz processor with 3GB of RAM and a GeForce 8800 GTX and have been able to enjoy most of the visual effects without compromising the frame rate too much. Battles still load a bit slowly, but the performance is generally good even with lots of action on the screen.  The battles of the Revolutionary War have a strong emotional impact. With a game like Empire Total War, I can't possibly cover all the cool features gamers will experience when they start playing. There are elective cabinet positions in your government, class friction in your cities, the ability to increase pressure to adapt enlightenment ideals, loads of pirates to deal with in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, and dozens of other features that I'd love to talk about, but the Poles have just invaded Austria and I've got transports full of Hessian infantry ready to hit the beaches in Estonia."

        "Content": "It must be a daunting prospect to follow up a critically acclaimed game that became a Greatest Hit.  The same could be said of following up a story that featured the infection and obliteration of Europe and most of the UK by alien creatures.  Fortunately, Insomniac loves a challenge, and they've been hard at work trying to best the adventure of Nathan Hale from Resistance: Fall of Man.  In case you were wondering, they've managed to succeed handily.  Not only is Resistance 2 an improvement in all facets of the game, it dwarfs the considerable action of the first title in the series.  The original game was a bleak alternate history tale of the devastation of Europe, not by the fires of war from a Nazi regime but by the invading Chimera, a strange alien race bent on the extermination of the human race.  The sequel picks up immediately where the original game left off, bringing Nathan Hale from the decimated territory of England to the safety of the United States, which was essentially the only remaining area in the world without Chimeran infestation.  At least, it was.  Two years after Hale's arrival in America, the Chimera launch massive coordinated attacks against cities in the USA, obliterating entire cities, killing thousands of civilians and converting others into shock troops to be used against the rest of the population.  As bad as things once appeared in Europe, they suddenly seem to be much worse in America.   Check out the Video Review here (HD available). Fortunately, Hale joins the SRPA, a secret governmental agency that deploys super soldiers known as Sentinels into battle.  Sentinels are much more than their name implies; these warriors have blood infused with strains of the Chimeran virus, giving them heightened abilities like super strength and health regeneration. America will need all of their abilities, because new monsters have been roaming its cities, forests and waterways. But can a squad of Sentinels uncover a way to repel the Chimeran hordes?  Will this be the last days of humanity, and just what will Hale's role be in the impending battle? Questions like these run rampant throughout the single-player campaign, which is a bit shorter than that of the original game (about 10 hours spread across a prologue and seven chapters), but no less complex or lacking in its depth due to the information revealed to Hale throughout the game.  In fact, it feels a bit tighter and faster paced than Fall of Man thanks to the action of the game and how information is revealed. Elements such as the Cloven from the original game, the Chimeran infection, and even the connection of the ARG Project Abraham and its connection to Resistance 2 are explained over time, and you do wind up gaining a large sense of what's going on within this grim universe.  However, for as many secrets that are discovered by the player, it seems as though just as many, if not more, are left unanswered.  This brings up one of my primary issues with the story, which is that I feel like it needed a narrator with some kind of perspective on the events of the mission like the first one did.  While Rachel wasn't omniscient, she did manage to tie together a lot of elements that weren't fully covered or highlighted in your missions.  By contrast, Resistance 2 is very Hale-centric, and focuses much more on his actions and what he wants to do.  That's fine, but his motivations behind what his decisions are or why he chooses to act a certain way or go to a specific location aren't fully explored.  As a result, some elements of the story aren't fully cohesive, and a large number of questions are left unanswered, which could potentially confuse players until the hypothetical Resistance 3 eventually is released.   Okay, who invited the T-Rex? For example, players are introduced to a number of supporting characters that comprise Hale's squad of Sentinels.  During one mission, you're introduced to some personal details about a particular soldier, which seems rather pertinent to the mission and plot at that moment, but it's quickly dropped and not addressed again.  Even though collectable intel fills in a few pieces of info that's left out, you really wonder just what the effect of exploring that side story would have been, or how that might have affected Hale or his squad or changed the action in the mission in any way.  Instead, the moment is lost, there's no reflection on it, and you feel somewhat slighted.  However, the story issues (which are arguably a minor or subjective problem) are overshadowed by the considerable elements that are marshaled together for Resistance 2.  The first game was well known for its atmosphere, tight corridors and its surreal environments.  All of that has been maintained, and even augmented.  For instance, it's extremely strange to walk into the town of Twin Falls, Idaho, and see the entire place covered with flesh pods, which obviously contain the unfortunate remains of the townsfolk. When one of your squad mates remarks that seeing the entire thing makes him miss conversion centers, you can't help but agree with him. But eclipsing this is the sheer scale and scope of the game, which is nothing short of epic. In every single level, there is at least one moment that will make your jaw drop, such as the absolute devastation of Chicago and its total infestation of Chimeran creatures.  The same can be said of the various \"monsters\" that you'll face off against, many of whom tower over the battlefield thanks to their size.  The giant Goliath walkers in the prologue are one thing, but when you first witness the dimensions of creatures like the Kraken or the Leviathan, it's definitely one of those things that gives you pause (as well as a sense of accomplishment when you defeat them).   The huge battles that erupt across the various levels will give you an adrenaline rush.  While the scale of the battles in the first game was large, the numbers present on screen at one point in time is simply incredible.  You'll find yourself and a dozen or more soldiers squaring off against twenty or more drones, a number of Chimera, and a couple of turrets, all firing bullets at you.  Facing down these incoming attacks can be daunting, but when you throw in the fact that the frame rate is rock solid without a hiccup, it's a pretty impressive feat that brings you into the action of the firefight. What also stands out is the fact that there are sections where you'll feel as though you've been through a massive battle -- after you and your squad have blasted hordes and hordes of monsters that descend on your position, you'll wade through the bodies of the fallen enemies that litter your path.  Details like this help to convey the situation that this is a larger cataclysmic battle in humanity's last days. Fall of Man was eye-catching in its battle sequences, but Resistance 2 blows it out of the water.  Part of this is due to the AI, which is solid for both enemy and NPC soldiers alike.  In Resistance 2, the kinds of Chimera that you'll face off against will force you to approach a fight with different tactics, because they will attack you in different ways.  Once again, Hybrids will team up with other soldiers, toss grenades or attempt to flank your position.  Spinners, on the other hand, will charge forward and try to overwhelm you with large numbers and powerful melee attacks.  Additionally, the game will frequently throw thirty or more of these beasts at you at one time, forcing you to quickly react and adjust to incoming strikes. Luckily, you're not forced to find a corner and face this threat alone.  The NPCs in Resistance 2 are just as smart, returning fire at enemies and frequently eliminating some enemies for you, including some creatures that you hadn't seen coming until almost too late.  Your Sentinel squad in particular is extremely skilled in this manner, targeting some creatures and blasting many of them that try to surround your position as you focus on the beasts charging directly at you.   That is one unhappy lizard. Of course, helping you eliminate the Chimera that foolishly stand in your way is the considerable weaponry at your disposal.  Insomniac has always provided creative weaponry in their games, and Resistance 2 is no different.  While you'll find a number of old favorites, such as the Carbine, Bullseye and Augur, there are a number of new weapons that are just as effective at eliminating Chimera.  For instance, the Magnum is a great weapon that packs a significant punch with each round fired, but its true strength lies in the alternate fire, which explodes the bullet and injures nearby enemies.  The Marksman is a rifle that can be used as an effective sniper rifle, although it fires off three rounds in quick succession.  However, it's also sends out an electrified orb that shocks nearby Chimera, allowing you to fire a few rounds into them. There are even new grenades, like the Spider Grenade, which emits tendrils along a surface that explode into flame, allowing you to destroy large groups of enemies.  Needless to say, you'll probably find a new favorite weapon or two in this arsenal, and you'll wind up unlocking more as you beat the game.  While the single-player experience is a great tale with an epic scope, it is equaled, and perhaps surpassed, by the multiplayer modes, which are perhaps some of the best I've ever played, and I'm particularly picky about my multiplayer.  The first mode that's included is a cooperative mode, which allows up to 8 players to leap into a game and explore the world of Resistance 2.  However, you're not playing as Nathan Hale or as one of his Sentinels.  Instead, you're part of the Spectres, a separate military faction tasked with tracking down and finding Gray Tech, items held by the Chimera around the world.  The co-op mode missions run parallel to the action of the single-player campaign, and help to point out that Nathan isn't the only one that's fighting this war against the Chimera; other humans are risking their lives trying to defeat the invaders as well. (Incidentally, Gray Tech is also vital because you'll be able to use these items to unlock additional missions as well as gear that can be used to outfit your characters.)   Just hope you can get in without being seen. Players are given a choice between three different classes, each with their own abilities and traits.  However, players aren't restricted to a particular class, and can switch at any time they wish, including during a match. The Soldier is the tank of the squad, equipped with a chain gun that projects an energy shield and packs more health than any other class.  Spec Ops are the damage dealers of the group, and while they have less health than others, their Marksman is particularly effective in wiping enemies out.  They are also the only class that can resupply soldiers by throwing out ammo packs.  Medics are the final class, using their Phoenix weapons to drain the health from enemies and convert it to healing blasts from their weapon.  They can also resuscitate party members faster than any other squad.  Based on the class chosen, players receive experience points depending on how well they perform the functions of their class.  This means that while everyone can receive XP for damaging enemies, soldiers will gain more for protecting troops, spec ops will gain more for resupplying troops and medics will gain more for reviving fallen troops.  These points are important, because points will eventually translate to higher rankings as well as unlocking new weapons and Berserk powers.  Berserks are specialized abilities that are tied to a particular class, and can be triggered when a player has gained enough experience points to fill a meter, which will slowly drain when the power is active. For instance, Soldiers can trigger Ironheart, which will reduce the amount of damage taken as long as the Berserk is active.  The Ring of Life, by contrast, allows Medics to set down an area that will constantly regenerate health of any allies in its proximity.  If a player frequently performs their job, they'll continually refill this meter, allowing them to try to swing the tide of the battle in their favor. That is an extremely important factor when it comes to the co-op mode, because the game takes a dynamic approach to play.  Initially, you'll be given an objective and based on how you're doing, the levels of each class in your party and the number of players in a match, the game will scale the action accordingly.   For example, if you find yourself playing a split-screen co-op game with one friend, fights will be easier than if you move in with seven other players and are surrounded by sixty enemies or more at the same point.  But on top of this, you'll also discover that the objectives will dynamically change as well, making each situation play out in a different manner every time.  What's more, as you blast through each checkpoint, you'll inevitably go up against some elite versions of these creatures, each of which hold more health than a standard Chimera and can inflict more damage as well.  But even outside of the scaling action of the cooperative play, the mode truly embeds a sense of working together with the other players in your squad, because it's not possible to survive this mode by going commando.  Each player is forced to rely on the other skills of their party mates to survive, but the one thing that I've found in playing a number of multiplayer matches is that anyone, from a newcomer to a seasoned veteran of the mode easily falls into a specific role and gets a hang of the gameplay, making it one of the most accessible multiplayer modes around.   The scale of Resistance 2 is phenomenal. The competitive mode is also just as solid.  Sure, Resistance 2 features many of the classic game modes that you've come to know and love in multiplayer matches, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag (known as Core Control in the game).  However, it's Skirmish mode where the mode sets itself apart, because the game will feature up to sixty players on scalable maps without any noticeable lag or technical hitches.  Skirmish mode is objective based just like the co-op mode, with dynamic goals assigned to the six squads of five players each for the Human and Chimeran sides.  These will cover a number of objectives such as controlling a particular node, protecting a specific location or eliminating a priority target on the other side.  Rival squads on the other side will be tasked with stopping you, so you'll always have some kind of opponent attacking you and your allies.  As time starts to run out in a round, you'll find that the objectives will start to funnel everyone towards a central point for overall domination of the map.  This is where the largest battles break out, and also where the action gets most intense, which only serves to boost the level of fun to huge levels. Toss in leaderboards and lots of other multiplayer features, including the MyResistance.net functionality that will track stats in real time while also giving a number of social networking features, and you have a title that will expand both replayability and community.  While the game is phenomenal in a technical and visual sense in the terms of its scale and number of enemies on screen at once, there are some weird technical issues that crop up here and there.  For one thing, some of the textures are noticeably lower resolution than others, and there's a lot of texture pop-in and screen tearing that will crop up here and there as you move through each environment.  What's more, you'll find some strange instances where monsters may twitch after they've been killed, or limbs of some creatures that have been blown off will still remain standing as if connected to some invisible body.  It's a strange thing to see what would appear to be a mannequin limb.  There are also some clipping issues that will crop up.  Given the scale of the game, many of these issues are understandable, particularly given the fact that there is a solid frame rate throughout, but they do still stand out as a problem to be found within the game.   Battles are large and between multiple onscreen characters. Sound within Resistance 2 is much stronger, with solid voice acting throughout the entire game to immerse you into the game action.  But much more than the voice acting of Hale and the other Sentinels, the ambient sounds within the game draw you into the experience of Resistance 2.  Perhaps the best example of this is nearing a flesh pod in one of the cities or towers in the game.  Initially, you'll hear some growling or rustling inside the pod, as if an animal was trapped inside.  The gestational sounds of the creature are truly unnatural and even unnerving to the ear.  However, what you'll find is that the loud noise associated to the explosion of these beasts in a slimy shower of blood and gore is disturbing, but quite satisfying.  For owners of the Collector's Edition, you'll be picking up a couple of nice additions for your game collection.  The standout is the Chimeran Hybrid statue, which brandishes a Bullseye and appears to be screaming at its intended victims.  Apart from the figurine, you'll receive a double-sided art book that hosts concept art of both game locations and characters from the game.  A Blu-ray disc is included as well, which hosts behind the scenes videos on the production of the game, multiplayer mode walkthroughs, a trailer that gives an alternate history timeline of the Resistance universe, a chapter from the upcoming novel and a digital copy of the Resistance 2 comic book.  For the most part, all of this won't have any impact on your gameplay experience, but the final item in the pack is a code to skin the HVAP Wraith chaingun in multiplayer games.  That way, players online will know that you've got the Collector's Edition when you leap into co-op or competitive matches.  It's solely a visual adjustment, but it's a nice extra."

This brings up one of my primary issues with the story, which is that I feel like it needed a narrator with some kind of perspective on the events of the mission like the first one did.  While Rachel wasn't omniscient, she did manage to tie together a lot of elements that weren't fully covered or highlighted in your missions.  By contrast, Resistance 2 is very Hale-centric, and focuses much more on his actions and what he wants to do.  That's fine, but his motivations behind what his decisions are or why he chooses to act a certain way or go to a specific location aren't fully explored.  As a result, some elements of the story aren't fully cohesive, and a large number of questions are left unanswered, which could potentially confuse players until the hypothetical Resistance 3 eventually is released.   Okay, who invited the T-Rex? For example, players are introduced to a number of supporting characters that comprise Hale's squad of Sentinels.  During one mission, you're introduced to some personal details about a particular soldier, which seems rather pertinent to the mission and plot at that moment, but it's quickly dropped and not addressed again.  Even though collectable intel fills in a few pieces of info that's left out, you really wonder just what the effect of exploring that side story would have been, or how that might have affected Hale or his squad or changed the action in the mission in any way.  Instead, the moment is lost, there's no reflection on it, and you feel somewhat slighted.  However, the story issues (which are arguably a minor or subjective problem) are overshadowed by the considerable elements that are marshaled together for Resistance 2.  The first game was well known for its atmosphere, tight corridors and its surreal environments.  All of that has been maintained, and even augmented.  For instance, it's extremely strange to walk into the town of Twin Falls, Idaho, and see the entire place covered with flesh pods, which obviously contain the unfortunate remains of the townsfolk. When one of your squad mates remarks that seeing the entire thing makes him miss conversion centers, you can't help but agree with him. But eclipsing this is the sheer scale and scope of the game, which is nothing short of epic. In every single level, there is at least one moment that will make your jaw drop, such as the absolute devastation of Chicago and its total infestation of Chimeran creatures.  The same can be said of the various \"monsters\" that you'll face off against, many of whom tower over the battlefield thanks to their size.  The giant Goliath walkers in the prologue are one thing, but when you first witness the dimensions of creatures like the Kraken or the Leviathan, it's definitely one of those things that gives you pause (as well as a sense of accomplishment when you defeat them).   The huge battles that erupt across the various levels will give you an adrenaline rush.  While the scale of the battles in the first game was large, the numbers present on screen at one point in time is simply incredible.  You'll find yourself and a dozen or more soldiers squaring off against twenty or more drones, a number of Chimera, and a couple of turrets, all firing bullets at you.  Facing down these incoming attacks can be daunting, but when you throw in the fact that the frame rate is rock solid without a hiccup, it's a pretty impressive feat that brings you into the action of the firefight. What also stands out is the fact that there are sections where you'll feel as though you've been through a massive battle -- after you and your squad have blasted hordes and hordes of monsters that descend on your position, you'll wade through the bodies of the fallen enemies that litter your path.  Details like this help to convey the situation that this is a larger cataclysmic battle in humanity's last days. Fall of Man was eye-catching in its battle sequences, but Resistance 2 blows it out of the water.  Part of this is due to the AI, which is solid for both enemy and NPC soldiers alike.  In Resistance 2, the kinds of Chimera that you'll face off against will force you to approach a fight with different tactics, because they will attack you in different ways.  Once again, Hybrids will team up with other soldiers, toss grenades or attempt to flank your position.  Spinners, on the other hand, will charge forward and try to overwhelm you with large numbers and powerful melee attacks.  Additionally, the game will frequently throw thirty or more of these beasts at you at one time, forcing you to quickly react and adjust to incoming strikes. Luckily, you're not forced to find a corner and face this threat alone.  The NPCs in Resistance 2 are just as smart, returning fire at enemies and frequently eliminating some enemies for you, including some creatures that you hadn't seen coming until almost too late.  Your Sentinel squad in particular is extremely skilled in this manner, targeting some creatures and blasting many of them that try to surround your position as you focus on the beasts charging directly at you.   That is one unhappy lizard. Of course, helping you eliminate the Chimera that foolishly stand in your way is the considerable weaponry at your disposal.  Insomniac has always provided creative weaponry in their games, and Resistance 2 is no different.  While you'll find a number of old favorites, such as the Carbine, Bullseye and Augur, there are a number of new weapons that are just as effective at eliminating Chimera.  For instance, the Magnum is a great weapon that packs a significant punch with each round fired, but its true strength lies in the alternate fire, which explodes the bullet and injures nearby enemies.  The Marksman is a rifle that can be used as an effective sniper rifle, although it fires off three rounds in quick succession.  However, it's also sends out an electrified orb that shocks nearby Chimera, allowing you to fire a few rounds into them. There are even new grenades, like the Spider Grenade, which emits tendrils along a surface that explode into flame, allowing you to destroy large groups of enemies.  Needless to say, you'll probably find a new favorite weapon or two in this arsenal, and you'll wind up unlocking more as you beat the game.  While the single-player experience is a great tale with an epic scope, it is equaled, and perhaps surpassed, by the multiplayer modes, which are perhaps some of the best I've ever played, and I'm particularly picky about my multiplayer.  The first mode that's included is a cooperative mode, which allows up to 8 players to leap into a game and explore the world of Resistance 2.  However, you're not playing as Nathan Hale or as one of his Sentinels.  Instead, you're part of the Spectres, a separate military faction tasked with tracking down and finding Gray Tech, items held by the Chimera around the world.  The co-op mode missions run parallel to the action of the single-player campaign, and help to point out that Nathan isn't the only one that's fighting this war against the Chimera; other humans are risking their lives trying to defeat the invaders as well. (Incidentally, Gray Tech is also vital because you'll be able to use these items to unlock additional missions as well as gear that can be used to outfit your characters.)   Just hope you can get in without being seen. Players are given a choice between three different classes, each with their own abilities and traits.  However, players aren't restricted to a particular class, and can switch at any time they wish, including during a match. The Soldier is the tank of the squad, equipped with a chain gun that projects an energy shield and packs more health than any other class.  Spec Ops are the damage dealers of the group, and while they have less health than others, their Marksman is particularly effective in wiping enemies out.  They are also the only class that can resupply soldiers by throwing out ammo packs.  Medics are the final class, using their Phoenix weapons to drain the health from enemies and convert it to healing blasts from their weapon.  They can also resuscitate party members faster than any other squad.  Based on the class chosen, players receive experience points depending on how well they perform the functions of their class.  This means that while everyone can receive XP for damaging enemies, soldiers will gain more for protecting troops, spec ops will gain more for resupplying troops and medics will gain more for reviving fallen troops.  These points are important, because points will eventually translate to higher rankings as well as unlocking new weapons and Berserk powers.  Berserks are specialized abilities that are tied to a particular class, and can be triggered when a player has gained enough experience points to fill a meter, which will slowly drain when the power is active. For instance, Soldiers can trigger Ironheart, which will reduce the amount of damage taken as long as the Berserk is active.  The Ring of Life, by contrast, allows Medics to set down an area that will constantly regenerate health of any allies in its proximity.  If a player frequently performs their job, they'll continually refill this meter, allowing them to try to swing the tide of the battle in their favor. That is an extremely important factor when it comes to the co-op mode, because the game takes a dynamic approach to play.  Initially, you'll be given an objective and based on how you're doing, the levels of each class in your party and the number of players in a match, the game will scale the action accordingly.   For example, if you find yourself playing a split-screen co-op game with one friend, fights will be easier than if you move in with seven other players and are surrounded by sixty enemies or more at the same point.  But on top of this, you'll also discover that the objectives will dynamically change as well, making each situation play out in a different manner every time.  What's more, as you blast through each checkpoint, you'll inevitably go up against some elite versions of these creatures, each of which hold more health than a standard Chimera and can inflict more damage as well.  But even outside of the scaling action of the cooperative play, the mode truly embeds a sense of working together with the other players in your squad, because it's not possible to survive this mode by going commando.  Each player is forced to rely on the other skills of their party mates to survive, but the one thing that I've found in playing a number of multiplayer matches is that anyone, from a newcomer to a seasoned veteran of the mode easily falls into a specific role and gets a hang of the gameplay, making it one of the most accessible multiplayer modes around.   The scale of Resistance 2 is phenomenal. The competitive mode is also just as solid.  Sure, Resistance 2 features many of the classic game modes that you've come to know and love in multiplayer matches, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag (known as Core Control in the game).  However, it's Skirmish mode where the mode sets itself apart, because the game will feature up to sixty players on scalable maps without any noticeable lag or technical hitches.  Skirmish mode is objective based just like the co-op mode, with dynamic goals assigned to the six squads of five players each for the Human and Chimeran sides.  These will cover a number of objectives such as controlling a particular node, protecting a specific location or eliminating a priority target on the other side.  Rival squads on the other side will be tasked with stopping you, so you'll always have some kind of opponent attacking you and your allies.  As time starts to run out in a round, you'll find that the objectives will start to funnel everyone towards a central point for overall domination of the map.  This is where the largest battles break out, and also where the action gets most intense, which only serves to boost the level of fun to huge levels. Toss in leaderboards and lots of other multiplayer features, including the MyResistance.net functionality that will track stats in real time while also giving a number of social networking features, and you have a title that will expand both replayability and community.  While the game is phenomenal in a technical and visual sense in the terms of its scale and number of enemies on screen at once, there are some weird technical issues that crop up here and there.  For one thing, some of the textures are noticeably lower resolution than others, and there's a lot of texture pop-in and screen tearing that will crop up here and there as you move through each environment.  What's more, you'll find some strange instances where monsters may twitch after they've been killed, or limbs of some creatures that have been blown off will still remain standing as if connected to some invisible body.  It's a strange thing to see what would appear to be a mannequin limb.  There are also some clipping issues that will crop up.  Given the scale of the game, many of these issues are understandable, particularly given the fact that there is a solid frame rate throughout, but they do still stand out as a problem to be found within the game.   Battles are large and between multiple onscreen characters. Sound within Resistance 2 is much stronger, with solid voice acting throughout the entire game to immerse you into the game action.  But much more than the voice acting of Hale and the other Sentinels, the ambient sounds within the game draw you into the experience of Resistance 2.  Perhaps the best example of this is nearing a flesh pod in one of the cities or towers in the game.  Initially, you'll hear some growling or rustling inside the pod, as if an animal was trapped inside.  The gestational sounds of the creature are truly unnatural and even unnerving to the ear.  However, what you'll find is that the loud noise associated to the explosion of these beasts in a slimy shower of blood and gore is disturbing, but quite satisfying."

        "Subtitle": "It demands your attention like a laser pistol to the forehead.",
        "Score": 9.5,
        "id": "a7d6dd2b5f839343def601eb5c37f3ff",
        "Content": "As wisps of brown dust whip across the sky far above and the sun slowly rises over the desolation that is The Wastes, take time to stop and just soak it all in: Fallout is back, and it's the real deal -- we couldn't ask for much else, frankly. It hits the right notes, covers the right themes and retains the feel of the original games we loved while bringing it up to modern times with a stunning new world to explore. We know -- it's hard to believe that a company, even one as appropriate and talented as Bethesda, could grab the wheel from the sinking Black Isle Studios and steer the franchise into safe waters. Happily, we can report that Fallout 3 definitely meets our expectations and, in this crowded holiday season, it demands your attention like a laser pistol to the forehead.  But what about all those comparisons to The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, negative or otherwise? They're certainly not unfounded; a lot of the structure and even the presentation of the game definitely sidles up against Bethesda's last release -- but that's no bad thing at all. In fact, Fallout's regionalised overworld, dungeon-esque ruins and NPC cast are perfectly in line with most RPGs and their conventions -- it just so happens that Oblivion was the template for the 3D engine, compass and dialogue exchanges. It fits just fine and, in fact, improves on the previous effort.   It's one thing to see a screenshot of a town like this; it's another thing entirely to walk through it and explore every nook for treasures.  For the uninitiated (or for those who've been locked in a giant steel vault, deep underground for 200 years), Fallout 3 is set in 2277 in the post-apocalyptic remnants of North America; ravaged by nukes fired by China, who may or may not have started the conflict. Regardless, you're stuck in the end result of the Great War. You are a vault-dweller -- as in previous games, you are thrust into a story that will take you above ground in a quest to track down your scientist father who's gone AWOL. To complicate things, you're both being hunted by mercenaries who want you dead and your head physically returned to Vault 101 from which you escaped.  Washington, D.C. is the specific setting this time around, marking a change of location from Fallout 2's Northern Californian wasteland. The decision to shift to the nation's capital provided Bethesda with plenty to play with in terms of geography and largely it makes for an inspired landscape of landmarks and an instantly recognisable horizon at all times. Of course, liberties were taken with layout and scale, but to the benefit of gamers who are eager for some fascinating location on which to shed some blood and organs.  Ghouls have their own underground city; Super Mutants and Behemoths now roam the inner city of D.C. -- presumably pushed east in the hundred years between the second and third game. And here you are, ready to make pacts and break them, running into The Brotherhood of Steel, The Enclave and a host of other factions along the way. Following your sometimes convoluted on-screen compass through the world, freedom of choice are your real tools of navigation.   The Wastes - stretching as far as the eye can see. It's your playground.  Everyone has their own definition for what a Fallout game should be; what it should and shouldn't contain, where the story should go and what you need to see. Bethesda did the right thing and stuck with the most fundamental elements of the series, refining where necessary and even adding a few new elements to bring the game up-to-date. Of these changes, the transition to a full 3D environment brought about some interesting design issues -- how to retain turn-based combat with the speed and flow of a first-person shooter. The result is the Vault-tech Assisted Targeting System, or 'V.A.T.S.' -- an appropriation of the limb-targeting system from the previous games, combined with a percentage-based chance to make a critical hit, depending on distance, stance and weapon type. Heck, it even includes the original targeting sound too, for an added sprinkling of nostalgia.  Whereas the original games were a classic slice of third-person isometric fare favoured by the genre, the first-person perspective has put the game, perhaps unfairly, into the same generic leagues as fully-fledged shooters -- both in the minds of gamers looking for an action fix (maybe misled by screenshots of blood-soaked frantic action) as well as RPG gamers crying foul. In practice, like a good Fallout game should, the emphasis is definitely on stats and percentages, hidden cleverly behind the V.A.T.S. system's targeting mechanics. In layman's terms, while you're pumping rounds into enemies in manual fire mode, hitting the right bumper and bringing the game into V.A.T.S. is definitely the superior way to fight in Fallout 3. You never quite feel like you're making the right connection with your ammo when you hit a target -- you don't get that visceral impact of rounds landing where you're aiming that you rightly should from an FPS these days.    Again, it just means that, for FPS fans, this isn't going to blow you away from a shooting gameplay standpoint. Happily though, for RPG fans who fear for their gameplay and depth, the V.A.T.S. system saves the day and keeps Fallout from feeling like a shooter. It is, in fact, up there with games like Eternal Darkness and Vagrant Story in terms of clever use of turn-based limb-targeting affecting damage dealt.  For example, when targeting foes on two legs, shooting out their legs means that they're incapacitated and can't flee from battle. Targeting their weapons can shoot the device out of their hands, buying you time and damaging their weapon in turn. Aiming for the head is, generally, all you really need to do -- you tend to deal markedly more damage to this region -- but it's a smaller target and therefore your percentage chance of landing a hit is lower.   Combat in V.A.T.S. clicks over to third-person for moments like this. Not pictured: an explosion of blood and viscera.  Affecting your combat are your raw abilities, dominated by the 'S.P.E.C.I.A.L.' acronym. These are selected right at the start of the game by picking up a copy of the 'You're SPECIAL!' children's book and determining what your guiding characteristics should be. Then, from here, during each level up, you can refine your skillset by gradually adding points to the condensed list of 13 different skills -- explosives, lockpicking, bartering, speech, small guns and so on. This is really where you get to define your character -- beyond the cosmetic customisation that you tinker with during the opening (which neatly influences how your father will look, based on procedural generation).  Additionally, during each level-up, you also get to choose one 'Perk' -- basically a long list of clever character skill modifiers that enhance your character's abilities significantly, such as finding more loot in crates, upping your chances of striking a critical hit, upping the gore, reducing your damage intake, boosting your skills and experience -- and they just get weirder and more impressive from there. With just twenty levels however, you will eventually max out your achievable Perks -- really necessitating a second play through with a different approach.  The Pip-Boy 3000 is your best friend; it's a little convoluted to find what you're looking for during your first hour or two of play (it incorporates your personal statistics and health, plus items and weapons and a separate section devoted to maps and quests). However, once you adjust to the monochrome display, it becomes second nature. The device also has an in-built light that throws just enough of a beam forward to illuminate dark areas. We're definitely thankful for this inclusion -- and that it doesn't require constant recharging (thanks, nuclear energy) -- because you'll spend a fair amount of your quest time in dark and largely undesirable locations.   The V.A.T.S. system at work.  A big part of what adds to Fallout 3's replay value rests within its sense of morality. Morality and consequences are two interconnected elements of the game design -- and have been since the original games -- and to a similar extent in Bethesda's RPGs too. The framework for your moral compass rests within the decisions you make in conversations, your approach to handling conflicts and quests, as well as whether you tend to help yourself to other peoples' belongings or plant live hand-grenades on them when they're not looking.  Most conversations with NPCs give you two or three options -- slanted towards friendly, cautiously neutral or straight-up arsehole. This is actually a small but persistent flaw within Bethesda's games -- the transparency of your choices makes 'right' answers too easy to perceive and therefore takes away the honesty of the real player's motives in a given situation. Fallout had similar issues -- but it feels like some of the dialogue just isn't as sharp as it could be, leading players along a little too much. The voice acting, outside of lead roles, is often pretty underwhelming too -- though, Morrowind and Oblivion never really shined in that department either. On the plus-side, there is far less repetition of character voices -- something that certainly plagued past games. The score is consistently fantastic -- haunting orchestral arrangements, pounding drums and a perfectly timed, seamless fade-ins during combat.   The game still favours weapons over unarmed combat, which is a shame. Most encounters with Super Mutants or bands of raiders can really only be solved with brute force -- attempting to deal melee damage, while admirable, really only results in you having to use far more 'Stimpacks' than necessary. The workaround is, of course, giving your character base statistics that favour 'tank'-type characters; a high strength and agility and proficiency with unarmed combat. Even so, unlike a game like Oblivion, and even Fallout 1 and 2 to some degree, most enemies tend to carry a primary rifle or gun weapon, as opposed to a sledgehammer or knife. You'll be at an immediate disadvantage in a scenario like this. The workaround is here to dope yourself up with all manner of stat-boosting drugs (renamed after the Australian OFLC threw a hissy-fit about real-world drug names in the game) and run the risk of becoming an addict and suffering withdrawals.  If, however, you embrace skills like speech and heavy weapons, there are few tasks you can't tackle. If you're not up for a brawl, there's a sense of just enough flexibility in design to allow you to talk your way around things and come up with another solution. If you want to shoot first, ask questions later, then pull out your minigun or flamer and have at it.   Atmosphere and production values most games would kill for.  All of these decisions affect your 'Karma', which ultimately tracks how you're being perceived in the wider world and which side of the karmic fence you sit on -- or whether you straddle it in the middle (which is trickly but reaps greater rewards at times). But this system actually holds problems of its own -- an unfortunate throwback to Oblivion. The game world has no real justice system, which means that the law of the land applies: if you shoot someone, prepare for a fight, or if you steal from someone, they'll make a scene. Unfortunately, very little tends to happen if you simply pickpocket someone or toe the line in terms of violence. You can reap significant rewards by manipulating the game's logic in this way; you never feel like you're being significantly punished for pickpocketing, and outside of potentially ruining a future mission, killing a character has no real consequence.  Karma, therefore, really tends to favour players who choose to be amoral -- a clear balance of good and evil, depending on each given situation.  Beyond karmic irrelevance at times, there's no question that Fallout 3 is an inspired piece of game design. We won't spoil things for you, but like Fallout 1 and 2, as well as Bethesda's previous games, there is just so much to discover and interact with. There are dozens of villages, a couple of large-scale cities, dozens more fully explorable stores, offices, schools, other Vaults, secret love dens and, amusingly, even the Bethesda offices. Walking down a street in Washington, D.C. leaves you with a true sense of scale and disrupted lifestyle. Cars still sit parked as they would've been 200 years prior; posters of Norman Rockwell-esque happy families litter walls, offsetting the destruction.   Can you spot the phallic symbol?  Venture into the heart of the capital and you will be floored with the creative use of locations like The Museum of Technology -- filled with fascinating winks towards alternative history. After raising your science skills high enough, you can eventually hack into most fluorescent green-screened computer systems and read up on the backstory behind long-dead characters and scenarios that still hold relevance in the game world today. If you're not the kind of player to read every note and search out secret areas, however, a lot of the game's charms may be lost on you.  The structure of the single-player story is fairly linear; if you want to pursue your father, you'll basically be following a series of straight lines. But to do so would neglect the best part of Fallout 3's package: incidental quests and random encounters. If you tire of pressing back the Super Mutants and Super Mutant Behemoths in DC or blasting ghouls or raiders in the intricate sewer system that stretches around the landscape, then take a detour and see what you turn up. If you press along the coast, you might hit Rivet City. Delve into the social structure onboard the beached aircraft carrier-turned-township and you might find some interesting subquests and topics to discuss, including the forbidden love between a young woman and a priest, a chronic drug addict who needs a push in the right (or wrong) direction and a nefarious fellow trying to track down a 'lost' android (a wonderful throwback to the civil war era, appropriated into a Blade Runner-esque replicants scenario.).   In fact, Bethesda really did nail the tone and content that the series is famous for. That 'feeling of Fallout' that we touched on earlier is never more apparent than when you immerse yourself in the seedier underbelly of post-apocalyptica; the rampant prostitution, the slavery and class imbalances, the debaucherous and frivolous lifestyles of the wealthy and corrupt, the displaced, the hardened and the downtrodden.  The Wastes is home to all of these people and often wandering off the path is far more satisfying than the main quest, which is disappointing if you're only out for personal gain and furthering the story. But it's out there in the radioactive mire that you discover the limits of your health -- you're constantly tied to how much radiation you can stand before becoming ill and having your stats affected accordingly. You can come across other mercenaries for hire, your very own dog, Dog Meat (another essential inclusion and thankfully boasting smart enough AI that it doesn't walk into your line of fire), and all manner of raw objects from which to assemble new weapons and items.  Again, much of this is par for the course for the series, but we can't stress enough how much the setting evokes feelings we don't often get from games these days. There's a level of immersion here, thanks to the micro-detailing on the ground, the naturalistic wear of the land and the man-made objects still dotting the landscape. It's a feeling of wonder and of true exploration -- asking players to see if they can scale the collapsed and segmented highway or climb the twisted girders and wreckage to find a secret ammunition cache hidden from the world.   Check out the US Video Review here.   Apart from the scattering of issues we have with the dialogue choices, Karma system and a few combat frustrations, there are only a handful of other minor issues to report. While we love that the enemies no longer seem to scale to your level and don't generally respawn inside key locations, you never feel like you have enough ammunition at all times. Not being able to fast travel or rest when an enemy is apparently nearby is yet another Oblivion/Morrowind throwback that remains as logical as it is frustrating.  Some users have reported freezing or glitching, though we thankfully haven't. Finally, as with all RPGs, if you're not careful about choosing where you want your skills to lie, you might find yourself constantly struggling with damage dealing and low health during points of the main storyline that require a lot of combat. But again, that's nothing new for fans of the genre. Just be forewarned that Fallout 3 really has as much in common with a true shooter as a game like Mass Effect does; it's not BioShock -- shooting is just a shell to hide the stats and percentages at play.

        "Content": "As series director Masahiro Sakurai said himself, it\u2019s a miracle Super Smash Bros. Ultimate exists. Having Mario and Zelda duke it out against Street Fighter\u2019s Ryu and Final Fantasy 7\u2019s Cloud on a battlefield from Metal Gear Solid is a weird, wonderful thing that only the Smash Bros. series can deliver \u2013 and Ultimate is undoubtedly Smash Bros. done big and done right.  With 74 fighters (depending on how you count), 108 stages, nearly 1300 Spirit characters to collect, and a single-player Adventure mode that took me a full 24 hours of playtime to beat, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate offers far more in a single package than any of its four predecessors. And while it occasionally felt like pruning away some of its weaker bits could have made Ultimate an even stronger and more consistent whole, excellent new mechanical and aesthetic additions make it stand out as far more than just a rehash of old ideas. It\u2019s nothing short of the brand-new Smash Bros. game I\u2019d imagined as the ideal sequel for the Switch.   See us discuss our Ultimate review in the video above on this week's NVC .  Smash Bros. has always been a fighting series that successfully pleases two crowds that are usually at odds: those who are seeking the pure, chaotic joy of an eight-player button-mashing brawl and those who prefer tense matches of hard-fought, high-level skill. While more competitive-minded players may turn off items and only fight on the completely flat Final Destination stage (or the functionally identical \u201cOmega\u201d versions of any of its other stages), others may find that unexpected items, deadly stage hazards, and epic Final Smash finishing moves are just as much at the core of what makes Smash Bros. great. Both \u2013 and every setting in between \u2013 coexist beautifully in Ultimate.  Smash Bros. has a rare accessibility that keeps its high skill cap from feeling intimidating. \u201c  More so than any previous game in the 19-year Smash Bros history, Ultimate is all about gathering as many iconic characters as possible from all over gaming \u2013 stretching far past its Nintendo-only origins \u2013 and letting you pit them against each other however you\u2019d like. It\u2019s a digital action figure toy box overflowing with the childhood memories of countless gamers, but with the beating heart of a competitive fighting game.  It\u2019s also remarkably easy to jump in, choose your favorite character and just start fighting, since it doesn\u2019t take much more than the control stick and two buttons to have access to most of a fighter\u2019s moveset. Unlike the Street Fighters, Mortal Kombats, and Tekkens of the world, here there aren\u2019t complicated input-combos beyond pressing A or B along with a single direction, making it simple to learn what a character can do just by playing around instead of having to look up move lists and spend time in a practice mode.  The fact that fighters don\u2019t have health bars gives Smash Bros. a rare accessibility that keeps its high skill cap from feeling intimidating. Instead of wearing an opponent\u2019s life down, you are increasing their percentage \u2013 the higher it goes, the easier they are to smash away with a strong attack, and knocking them off the map entirely gets you a KO. While it\u2019s still scary to be at high percentage, this system avoids that depressive feeling of \u201cany little hit and I\u2019m dead, so this is pointless\u201d that traditional fighting games can sometimes cause when your health drops to a sliver. In Smash Bros. Ultimate, it feels like you\u2019ve still got a fighting chance.   And while that accessibility is important, those looking for more technical nuance will find plenty of it in dodges, grabs, shield timings, and a veritable ballet of mid-air movement strategy \u2013 not to mention how all of this changes with the different abilities, attacks, and even weights of every character. A fast, tiny character like Pichu feels wildly different from the hard-hitting Bowser, and learning the subtleties of playing both as and against them is vital. There\u2019s a deep well of combos and counterplay for those who want to dive into it all, and it feels like Nintendo is more actively aware and supportive of that side of Smash Bros. than it has been before.  None of these traits are new to Ultimate specifically, but it\u2019s important that the key elements of what makes a Smash Bros. game a Smash Bros. game are all alive and well here. And while the framework and DNA of Super Smash Bros for the Wii U is very clearly present, this doesn\u2019t feel like a simple port or a \u201cDeluxe Edition\u201d by any means. Due to there just not being that many Wii Us out there, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if many of the people playing this latest iteration missed the last Smash Bros. entirely, but Ultimate doesn\u2019t lean on that assumption as a crutch, and leaves essentially no part of the previous design untouched.  Tuned for Destruction  Fighters in Ultimate feel a little bit faster and a lot harder hitting overall. Launching an enemy with a Smash attack now feels a bit like punching a balloon, with fighters flying away faster before losing speed quicker. That means there\u2019s often less ambiguity on whether or not a hit will turn into a KO, with fewer of those frustrating moments where you slowly drift toward an unexpected death. (There\u2019s even a radar that appears when a player is off screen to show where they are in relation to the edge of view and the edge of destruction \u2013 an addition I liked, but can be turned off for those who don\u2019t.)   In one-on-one fights or when only two fighters remain, there\u2019s a seriously epic freeze-frame zoom effect when you land a hit that will almost certainly result in a KO, similar to what already happened with Little Mac\u2019s KO punch. That alone makes those big smash attacks even more satisfying, and makes it even clearer when someone actually has a chance to recover from a hard hit or not.  The custom ruleset feature is a godsend, though it does mean making small tweaks is a little clunkier. \u201c  Many of the Final Smash attacks have been made easier to handle as well. Some of the more inconsistent ones like Pac-Man, Pikachu, and Donkey Kong have been changed to hit more reliably, and Final Smashes that lock enemies into an animation for guaranteed damage are more common across the board. That makes them feel like less of an imbalance when playing with Smash Balls on (which are almost frustratingly hard to catch now), and the introduction of an optional Final Smash Meter that slowly charges up for a weaker version of the move offers a completely new way to weave these exciting finishers into a match.  Thankfully, if you don\u2019t want to play Smash Bros. the same way I do, Ultimate has made it significantly easier to adjust the rules of a match. You can now make custom rulesets to save and reselect whenever you\u2019d like. I had one for my default preference, one for using the Final Smash Meter, one with no items or stage hazards at all, one where the only items are Pok\u00e9 Balls, and as many more as I wanted. Saving rulesets is a godsend so that you don\u2019t have to keep making the same big changes over and over when the mood to play a different way strikes, but it does make slightly tweaking rulesets on the fly (say, if you want to add an extra life for a round or two) more cumbersome, leaving me wishing we had the best of both worlds.  A new rule option called Stage Morph quickly became one of my absolute favorite additions to Ultimate. It lets you pick two maps in stage select and then set how long into a match the level will transform from one stage to the other. It\u2019s a fantastic way to experience more of the absurd 108 maps Ultimate has to offer, and can even let you do interesting things like start on a large map but then transition to a smaller one once some of the combatants have presumably been eliminated \u2013 just make sure you aren\u2019t toward the edges of the stage when that happens or you\u2019ll likely drop to an undeserved death.   However, the level-select UI itself isn\u2019t ideal. It\u2019s literally just a giant grid of barely discernible pictures of each stage organized by the date of their debut Smash Bros. game. I greatly prefer this to having to scroll through options one by one as some other games have their stage selects laid out, but there are so many levels so closely packed together that I forgot some existed, and often had to spend considerable time hunting for the specific one I want. It\u2019s a pretty spoiled problem to have, but I still wish I had the option to sort them alphabetically or by game, or at least tag some as favorites.  The levels themselves, however, are generally great. It\u2019s not every single level that has ever been in Smash Bros. like the character list is (I don\u2019t care what anybody says, I miss you, Pok\u00e9 Floats!), but it sure feels comprehensive. It\u2019s a bit of a bummer that only four of them are brand new, but previously 3DS-only levels like Tortimer Island and Paper Mario still feel like fresh additions on Switch \u2013 some of the classic returning levels have also been visually touched up and look absolutely fantastic, particularly Fourside and Corneria from Melee.  Still, there are a few bad apples in the bunch that had me confused why they made the cut when others didn\u2019t. Pretty much the only good thing truly terrible stages like Pac-Land and The Great Cave Offensive bring to the party are interesting skins for their Omega and Battlefield variations \u2013 the map pool would have been stronger as a whole without them dragging down the average.   Similarly, while cool new items like the Beastball and Rage Blaster have been added, stupid and busted ones like Boss Galaga, the Gust Bellows, and the Beetle have stuck around. These egregious items and stages aren\u2019t a huge issue since Ultimate gives you the tools to easily turn them all off when you make your rulesets, but it does make it feel like Nintendo focused more on quantity over quality when deciding these lists.  Choose Your Fighter  However, I am happy that Nintendo took this approach for Ultimate\u2019s character roster. Having every character ever, good or bad, return was an ambitious and excellent decision. Ultimate\u2019s roster is downright incredible, with a wealth of attitudes, games, and play styles represented. The decision to classify certain characters as \u201cEcho\u201d fighters instead of full new characters is also a long time coming, making glorified reskins like Daisy and Dark Pit feel less like they\u2019re stealing a roster spot from someone else.  Having every character ever, good or bad, return was an ambitious and excellent decision. \u201c  Six entirely new, non-Echo challengers have joined the fight, with six more coming as DLC over the next year or so \u2013 Piranha Plant will be free until January 31 before becoming paid DLC like the other five, which will also bring new stages with them. None of them particularly break the mold of what a Smash Bros. character can be (though that\u2019s diverse and widely explored territory already) but they are each varied in their own way and all feel right at home in Ultimate.  The standouts for me are undoubtedly Simon Belmont from Castlevania (and his Echo, Richter) and King K. Rool from Donkey Kong. Simon\u2019s abilities feel extremely true to his game, throwing axes, boomerangs, and explosive vials of holy water, with whip-based smash attacks that reward precision and careful timing. Meanwhile, King K. Rool feels like the giant, unhinged crocodile villain he is: a wonderful blend of crazy, terrifying, and extra beefyness.  Every Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Fighter 78 Images  Isabelle from Animal Crossing is also fantastic in the adorable charm she brings, but feels fairly derivative of Animal Crossing\u2019s Villager in terms of her actual moveset. Inkling shakes things up drastically with a tricky and slightly unintuitive ink-ammo system that you have to refill as you fight. But no matter how new or old they feel, every one of the 11 new fighters and Echos is a welcome and creative addition to the roster.  Just don\u2019t expect to play any of them you want right out of the gate. While there are 74 fighters total, you only start with 11 unlocked \u2013 the original eight from the first Super Smash Bros. on N64, plus the three custom Mii fighters if you make them. It\u2019s not hard to unlock more \u2013 a new one tends to appear every few matches, or you can hunt them down in the Adventure and Classic modes \u2013 but with so many, it\u2019ll likely take you at least at least 10 hours to fill out your roster through multiplayer alone. There are cheesy ways to speed that up, but growing my collection naturally while I played with friends was genuinely exciting.  The more people you have playing with you, the faster unlocks will arrive, and Ultimate has thankfully broken down the barriers between four-player and eight-player Smash. While playing with more than four people was previously relegated to specific large maps, it\u2019s all one mode now. Eight-player Smash Bros. is still an unwieldy but enjoyable mess, but being able to seamlessly get a fifth player in on the action was appreciated.   And if you don\u2019t want to subject yourself to that chaos, playing one-on-one is just as easy as it\u2019s ever been. There are even little added touches here, like the number of lives each player has left being enlarged on the screen anytime any player dies. There\u2019s also a cool new mode called Squad Strike which lets you pick either three or five different fighters and fight in a \u201cBest Of\u201d-style head-to-head match \u2013 this mode can also just let you play what is essentially a 1v1 Stock match, but where each life is a new fighter.  Smells Like Team Spirit  While multiplayer really is the point of Smash Bros., the big single-player draw in Ultimate is a new system called Spirits. There are nearly 1300 Spirits in Ultimate, each of which is a character or recognizable thing from video games as ubiquitous as Super Mario Bros. and as obscure as the 1992 Japan-only Game Boy game Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru, and every one is represented by a piece of art from its source material. While I miss the detailed trophies of past Smash Bros. games, the ludicrously large selection of Spirits makes it a worthwhile trade-off \u2013 another example of Nintendo choosing quantity over quality.  There are nearly 1300 Spirits in Ultimate, each of which is a character or recognizable thing from another game. \u201c  While seeing so many Spirits from all over gaming is extremely cool, everything about the system those Spirits are used in feels overdesigned. In certain modes, you can equip one Primary Spirit at a time (which have three types in a Rock, Paper, Scissors-style weakness system) alongside up to three Support Spirits, all of which give you buffs or new abilities like immunity to poison or electricity. Primary spirits can be leveled-up either through fighting or by feeding them snacks (which also costs a currency called Spirit Points) or Spirit cores, which you get from dismissing duplicate Spirits \u2013 but you can also use cores to summon new Spirits, but only if you have the very specific correct ones to do so.  It\u2019s fun to tune your team of Spirits during the Adventure mode, World of Light, or while collecting Spirits on a timed, randomized menu called the Spirit Board, but navigating this system is sort of a mess. As with the level select, the system for organizing and equipping Spirits is just a big ol\u2019 list, eventually hundreds of Spirits long. There are filters to help you find specific abilities like immunities to certain damage types, but if you want to find a very specific effect \u2013 say, starting a fight with a Beam Sword \u2013 and don\u2019t remember which obscure character that belongs to, you pretty much have to go through them one by one to find it. Because of that hassle, I generally stuck with a few I found powerful and used the \u201cauto-fill\u201d recommendation button otherwise.   The most impressive part of the Spirits is the fights you have to win to collect them. Nearly every Spirit has a battle specific to it modeled after the character itself, using Ultimate\u2019s roster and special effects to loosely recreate them. Some are funny, like Snorlax being a giant, gray King K. Rool who doesn\u2019t move an inch, while others are challenging and emulate the games they are from, like Dr. Wily, which is essentially a \u201cBoss Rush\u201d where you have to defeat eight Mega Man fighters in a row in a Stamina-based match before a Dr. Mario appears to face you.  The Spirit Board is great, but the post-fight minigame it forces on you to earn a Spirt feels pointless and annoying. \u201c  Beating these Spirit fights earns you that Spirit outright in World of Light, but annoyingly, that\u2019s not the case on the Spirit Board. There, beating one gives you a strange roulette wheel challenge where you have to try and shoot that character through a spinning shield. Hitting gives you the Spirit, while missing means you have to wait for them to randomly show up again, beat them again, and shoot again with a smaller shield guarding them.  It\u2019s a pointless and frustrating step to add to this process, especially when there are over a thousand spirits to collect. I never found a Spirit fight I didn\u2019t find amusing or clever, which is impressive in itself, but they are also a novelty, and that\u2019s fleeting. That Snorlax fight is fun once, but it quickly lost its charm when I was forced to do it again because of a bad shot after the fight. And unfortunately, for the fights I did find clever enough to want to revisit, like Dr. Wily, there\u2019s no way to refight a Spirit you already have apart from hoping it shows up on the Spirit Board again. Still, there are just so many Spirits here that the sheer variety of the Spirit Board keeps it fairly amusing on its own.  Blinded by the Light  Spirits really feel like they were designed with World of Light in mind, though the mode ends up being fairly one-note because of that. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\u2019s Adventure mode has a shockingly elaborate and long campaign that took me 24 hours of playing to beat, and even then with only 84% completion. It\u2019s a consistently amusing mode, but despite being longer than many full games nowadays, I came away from it feeling like it was still just pretty good icing to accompany Smash Bros.\u2019 excellent multiplayer cake.   World of Light has you exploring a massive board full of winding paths, all blocked up by hostile Spirits along the way. You start with only Kirby unlocked and wander the board picking fights, collecting and leveling up Spirits, and unlocking characters as you go. There are smaller dungeon-style maps to enter, some light puzzles to solve, and even massive unique bosses to fight, as well as a whole bunch of secrets to collect.  While World of Light\u2019s overworld can start to feel rather samey after a bit \u2013 a series of arbitrary paths over a varied and lovely 2D map \u2013 the dungeons offer some really exciting surprises. The standout for me was a whole section modeled after a Street Fighter World Tour mode, with custom rules that make it Stamina-based with low jumping to emulate Street Fighter gameplay. Others are similar hits of nostalgia that recreate or pay homage to different games, and they\u2019re worth discovering on your own.  The problem is, through all of this you are still just doing endless Spirit battles. They are themed nicely around each section of the map \u2013 a racetrack area is where I fought Captain Falcon and the Excitebike Spirit, while I found Star Fox\u2019s Peppy and Super Mario RPG\u2019s Geno among the stars \u2013 but it\u2019s essentially the exact same process of fighting Spirits on the Spirit Board, just set on a hodgepodge map of unique areas.   Everything you do in World of Light is centered around getting and improving Spirits, but I found enough strong Spirits to get me through almost any fight roughly 10 hours into the campaign. That meant I played roughly 14 more hours without any sort of significant progression for my character, and most extras I was incentivized to collect were fairly pointless. Seeing what creative new Spirits fights were waiting for me was still consistently fun and amusing, but my strategy not needing to change for so long made it start to get dull toward the end.  World of Light never stopped being amusing, and the Spirit battles are consistently clever, but the mode's simple progression causes it to drag after the first dozen hours. \u201c  There\u2019s also a skill tree in World of Light that lets you get some massively powerful abilities. By the 13-hour mark, my smash attacks charged extremely quickly, healed me, could be charged indefinitely, and gave me super armor so that I couldn\u2019t be interrupted during them. That meant I could win most Spirit fights in two or three well-placed smash attacks, trivializing most fights I faced. That also made the copious amount of unlockable Spirit training Dojos and item shops similarly pointless, despite being super cool from a flavor standpoint.  While they also get significantly easier, the boss fights did continue to delight. I was blown away by the fight against Monster Hunter\u2019s Rathalos in particular, as it recreated the feeling of that game far more faithfully than expected. You first had to chase the Rathalos around a dungeon map to its nest, then could use Pitfall and Deku Nut items to trap and stun it to deal damage. It was extremely cool, even if it wasn\u2019t overly difficult by that point in the campaign.  And that\u2019s sort of World of Light overall: it\u2019s amusing, enjoyable, and extremely detailed, but also pretty thin. The Spirit fights are neat and their quantity is downright unbelievable, but the only difference between fighting them on the Spirit Board and on a map is that one gives you access to abilities on an incredibly strong skill tree. The problem isn\u2019t directly the campaign\u2019s length itself, but the lack of significant change during that time \u2013 as it stands, Nintendo likely could have trimmed five hours of fat and had a more compelling Adventure mode for it.   That makes me a little sad, because there are undoubtedly enjoyable surprises worth experiencing buried amongst the tidal wave of Spirits that are very difficult to access. The last hour of World of Light in particular is one of the greatest video game finales I\u2019ve played in years, and actually made the preceding 10-plus hours of repetition worth it. There isn\u2019t much story during World of Light, with cutscenes that are gorgeous but only appear at the beginning, middle, and end, but that ending still managed to get me invested and absurdly excited about what was unfolding before me.  Still, despite World of Light\u2019s well not being nearly as deep as it is wide, it\u2019s a mode I enjoyed overall. Smash Bros.\u2019 alternate modes have never traditionally been full-on slam dunks, which isn\u2019t a problem as long as they don\u2019t mess up the multiplayer along the way. And while Spirit teams can be optionally turned on in PvP, there\u2019s no pressure to do so, which lets World of Light live happily as an amusing distraction.  A Twist on the Classics  Outside of the realm of Spirits, Classic mode makes a return with a slightly tweaked format. Every fighter has a custom-made gauntlet of six opponents to face, themed loosely around them \u2013 for example, Bowser has to fight through every red character in Ultimate before facing off with Mario. There\u2019s also a surprisingly amusing auto-scrolling platformer in each run, and the boss fights from World of Light are reused here as well, making them easier to revisit than the Spirit fights themselves.   100-Man Smash makes a return, now called Century Smash, alongside All-Star mode and the still aptly named Cruel Smash. There\u2019s no target or challenge mode, but there are enough achievement-style challenges that offer rewards to keep you exploring old modes in ways you might not normally think to. I am also particularly a fan of the new Smashdown multiplayer mode, which eliminates fighters from the select screen after you\u2019ve used them once. Simply put, there\u2019s a lot to distract you when you need a break from standard Smash and World of Light.  Ultimate has one of the most impressive libraries of game music I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c  Another returning feature from the Wii U Smash Bros. that I absolutely love is the music selector. Ultimate has one of the most impressive libraries of game music I\u2019ve ever seen, and you can hand pick which track a stage plays when you select it. You can even create playlists of your favorite songs and turn off the screen to use your switch like an iPod, though I had pretty rough results with buttons getting pressed and songs getting skipped around while mine was in a case in my bag, making it better for home use than on the go.  That said, I was shocked by just how great Ultimate looks and runs in handheld mode. This is a truly fantastic-looking game \u2013 a noticeable step up from the last one \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t feel trimmed down at all when played mobile. (Its level-select issues are made predictably worse, however.) But there seemed to be no noticeable performance difference between the two modes.  Either docked of handheld, the only real issues I noticed were related to load times, but mostly in places where it didn\u2019t matter much. For example, waiting for Mii fighter outfits to load in the creator makes building a character annoyingly slow, and a fighter\u2019s alternate colors can sometimes take a few seconds to appear on the character-select screen, but matches, menus, and everything else important loads fairly fast. There was also some very slight frame lag during character select with eight players, but that seems forgivable considering it disappeared during the match itself.  Every Amiibo Ever 196 Images  On the hardware side, playing with the Switch\u2019s Joy Con controllers works okay, but they don\u2019t really allow for the best Smash experience. I am a huge fan of the Joy Con generally, but the flatter joysticks and digital triggers aren\u2019t ideal for the fast and precise movements Smash Bros. demands. I spent most of my time playing Ultimate with my childhood GameCube wireless WaveBird controller with a USB adapter, but the Switch Pro Controller works extremely well, too. It\u2019s nice that there\u2019s a variety of control options, and you can even use a single sideways Joy Con in a pinch (though I don\u2019t really recommend it), but getting a peripheral controller feels more necessary here than with other Switch games.  Ultimate also has some pretty interesting online features, including a system that essentially lets you collect the virtual dog tags of anyone you beat online. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to test this out because the online features weren\u2019t available ahead of launch. We\u2019ll have to monitor those post-launch and see if there are any issues, but if Splatoon 2 and Mario Tennis Aces are any indication, Nintendo seems to have a significantly better handle on online play than when Super Smash Bros. launched on the Wii U."

        "Content": "It\u2019s not hard to get lost in the deep, subterranean world of Hollow Knight \u2013 and I mean that in more ways than one. The expansive catacombs of Hallownest have countless paths to explore and secrets to find. But more than that, it\u2019s rich with lore, history, and purpose that drew me into a 2D Metroidvania kingdom I wanted to uncover every inch of. The deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it has to offer. I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect, and secrets to uncover. But what\u2019s truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, sound, and a million other little details combine to give each area of the map a distinct sense of place, and those areas jigsaw together in a way that feels intentional and alive. label=World%20Wide%20Web There are far more of these distinct biomes than I ever expected to discover, and the edges of each one blend together with the next in ways that help them make sense in the world. For example, walls on the border of the Fungal Wastes, even impassable ones in other areas, will be dotted with its telltale mushrooms. The lush environment of an area called Greenpath feels bustling and humid, a stark difference to the cold, dark caves of the Forgotten Crossroads. The bubble-filled region of Fog Canyon isn\u2019t technically underwater, but the muffled filter over all of its audio goes hand-in-hand with jellyfish enemies and a brighter blue tone. Hallownest\u2019s capital city, the City of Tears, is a metropolis in a huge cave where it\u2019s always raining. But it wasn\u2019t until 10 hours after I first discovered this place that I stumbled across the Blue Lake, a massive body of serene water positioned just above the underground city. Hollow Knight doesn\u2019t shove this connection in your face, it just lets you explore its world and piece together the story for yourself as you sit down and enjoy a moment of quiet. Hollow Knight's larger story is told in a subtle way, but its lore is so deep that I feel like I could write a book on it. In fact, Hollow Knight tells you very little about what\u2019s going on, and instead sends you into a world full of monumental events that all happened long before you arrived: wars and heroes, love and culture, disease and destruction. The aftermath of Hallownest\u2019s troubled past is left for you to discover and comes through loud and clear, but only if you take the time to listen. It\u2019s told in a very subtle way, but teaches you so much about Hallownest in the process that I feel like I could practically write a book on it. It\u2019s a tragic tale, one full of fallen heroes and terrible decisions, but it still manages to make time for beautiful, calm, and hopeful moments throughout. And it\u2019s easy to enjoy those moments, because Hollow Knight\u2019s hand-drawn art is simply beautiful. It\u2019s a world that manages to feel cohesive despite its citizens being adorable bug-people in a dying cave. The story (and your place in it) is picked up as you go. Some of it through dialogue with the adorable and quirky characters who still reside in this decrepit kingdom, some through important story events, and some just by observing your surroundings and the clues strewn about it. After my second playthrough, I have a fairly clear picture of Hallownest\u2019s history, but it\u2019s a picture I assembled myself. As much as I genuinely loved being pushed out of the boat and told to start kicking, Hollow Knights\u2019 first few hours can be a predictably sink-or-swim experience as a result. It\u2019s an unashamedly challenging game that does a great job of silently teaching you how to play, but it still felt a little bit daunting to start \u2014 especially when death means having to fight your way back to your corpse to reclaim your money, called Geo. You have to find a map seller named Cornifer in each area before you can start keeping track of where you\u2019ve been, and even then you have to equip a specific charm to see where you are on it in real time. That, coupled with fact that getting good at the combat takes practice, means I spent my first couple hours just trying to figure Hollow Knight out. But once I picked up the rhythm of its combat and the pattern of exploring its initially restrictive cave systems, Hollow Knight clicked in a way that made me never want to put it down. After Greenpath, the second major area, you reach a point where there\u2019s no clear \u201ccorrect\u201d direction anymore. Like any Metroidvania, your path options are gated behind things like ledges too high to reach or gaps too far to jump until you find the necessary upgrades, but there are enough options that don\u2019t result in dead ends to keep to you exploring for quite a while. Hidden around the Kingdom of Hallownest are traditional Metroidvania abilities like a dash and a wall climb to help you better navigate its caves and reach new places. These new movement abilities also allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain faster and more efficiently, giving the obligatory need to retread old ground (which does happen a fair amount) fresh life. Suddenly your wall climb turns that small gap between platforms into a shortcut instead of a hazard. New movement abilities allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain, giving the obligatory need to retread old ground fresh life. Thankfully, there is also a flavor-filled quick-travel system called the Stagways. Stag stations can be found and unlocked across Hallownest, allowing you to call The Last Stag to take you between them. What could just be a jump between points instead becomes a quest in itself, and I almost always spoke to The Stag after unlocking a station not to travel, but to hear his gruff but optimistic take on whatever new stop I brought him to. Hollow Knight\u2019s world also undergoes more concrete changes as you progress. Railways and elevators will unlock permanently, opening shortcuts that loop back to earlier sections and easing the burden of backtracking. One early area eventually even morphs into a much harder late-game section in a way that makes it feel like your actions in Hallownest have real weight. label=Hammer%20Meets%20Nail The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky as you learn to time quick directional sword slashes with jumps and dashes. It rewards patience and skill massively \u2014 killing enemies is a matter of sharp timing, learning attack patterns, and having quick reflexes more than just the upgrades you earn along the way. You can find upgrades to your weapon damage, increase your max health, and equip charms with a variety of abilities, but more importantly, I just got better as I went. A boss that gave me tons of trouble at the start of the game was a pushover when I returned for a second playthrough. And while your timing requires precision, the combat itself is somewhat forgiving. Hitting enemies lets you collect a resource called Soul which you can stop and channel at any time to heal, as long as you don\u2019t get hit. So while the all-or-nothing nature of dropping your Geo on death gives exploration a sweaty-palmed tension, Hollow Knight also gives you the tools to take a breath, gather Soul, and get your health back up. There are a decent amount of smaller enemies scattered around each level as well, acting as weaker baddies that let you recover Soul and collect Geo in relative safety. But there are just as many scary opponents too, and dying far from a checkpoint is a real risk. The enemy variety is impressive to say the least, with nearly 100 different types to fight, and even ones with similar behaviors looking dramatically different depending on what area of the map you find them in. A charm system allows you to customize your own methods for killing those enemies as well. Each charm takes up a set number of notches (which you can earn more of along the way) and range from small effects, like extending your attack distance or gathering more Soul on hits, to large trade-off changes, like doubling your health but preventing you from healing at all, which can dramatically change how you play. Thankfully, you can freely swap them out whenever you sit at a bench, which also serve as Hollow Knight\u2019s save points and healing stations. That meant I could come up with specific combinations to counter different scenarios on the fly. I had my favorite loadout for general use, a loadout that upped the amount of Geo I got and collected it automatically, and a loadout for moving more quickly. If you prefer using Hollow Knight\u2019s Soul-consuming damage abilities instead of swinging your sword (called a Nail) you could equip charms that increase Soul damage and even change your attacks entirely. For some harder boss fights that didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to heal, my loadout even shifted to maximizing my temporary health at the cost of unequipping charms I had grown to rely on. Through all that experimentation, it never felt like there was a wrong choice. All the charms are good, and they all work, and it\u2019s up to you to determine which you like the most and which work best for the scenario in front of you. And if any situation will push you to test those choices out, it will likely be one of Hollow Knight\u2019s copious amount of boss fights. Seriously: there are dozens of different bosses, ranging from small and quick enemies to large, deadly brutes. These contained challenges are some of the best thrills available because they force you to find a strategy, learn when it\u2019s safe to attack or heal, and get better each time you get crushed Because believe me, you will get crushed. Those hard losses occasionally slowed my momentum, but there is almost always some other path to explore. If I was having trouble pushing through in one direction, I\u2019d just wander down another until I got stronger (or just better) and decided to face that tough fight again. label=Soul-Searching%20For%20Secrets In fact, a staggering amount of Hollow Knight\u2019s best content is entirely optional. You could probably beat the campaign without seeing two-thirds of what it has to offer, though the quest to get an alternate (and much better) ending will pull you in front of significantly more. Bosses, thoughtful story, and whole sections of the map can remain hidden, which adds to that feeling of actually exploring this world when you do stumble upon them. None of Hollow Knight's optional content feels like filler. The key here is that none of this optional content feels like filler. I actively wanted to find every secret I possibly could and learn what was actually going on in the story. It all felt unique, significant, and wonderfully put together. Even after the 30+ hours it took me to truly beat Hollow Knight, I was excited to go back for more. Having so much to do at any given time can admittedly be overwhelming at points. There can be so many open paths on your map that the burden of deciding which to explore next can make you doubt which is the \u201cright\u201d way. But the beauty of Hallownest is that there is very rarely a right or wrong choice, and it\u2019s unlikely two players will explore these caves in the same order. Hollow Knight has also been getting free post-launch content updates since its launch on PC last year, all of which are included on Switch (and more updates are on the way, according to developer Team Cherry). Those patches have added new areas and new bosses, and one even added the ability to add custom markers to your map. The simple act of being able to visually track when I need to revisit an area or which paths I\u2019ve yet to go down is a godsend. It has helped me take stock of what needs to be done alongside the other late-game amenities Hollow Knight makes available for completionists, like maps that will eventually track certain collectibles. But so much of what\u2019s worth finding past the point where you can \u201cbeat\u201d Hollow Knight is pure, concentrated lore. To really get a picture of what you\u2019re doing (and to properly inform an important choice you have to make) you need to explore. I love that those key moments in the story tie into some of the best gameplay challenges it has to offer as well. For example, one of the final secret areas basically transforms Hollow Knight into a Super Meat Boy-style platformer with very little combat. Platforming challenges exist all throughout the world, with some of the most thrilling requiring you to use your Nail as a pogo stick while you bounce across spikes, Duck Tales-style \u2014 but this area is something else entirely, and tells you about the history of that location with its themes. And, as I mentioned before, the music adds to that setting and art one thousand times over. While each location has its own theme and boss fight music, individual melodies and instruments will shift in and out as you move from screen to screen. The mood and tension of a scene are often driven by that music, and the soundtrack has quickly become one of my favorites. Where to Buy Hollow Knight - Switch 0 $35.99  save 17% $29.77 at Amazon"

        "Content": "Update: Civilization VI has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .   Every game in the legendary, 25-year-old Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization 4X strategy series puts a new spin on the grand concept of taking a nation from a single nomadic tribe to a world-dominating superpower, one turn at a time. In that way Civilization VI looks familiar, but it\u2019s loaded with some very smart and bold improvements that give it new levels of depth. Once I get absorbed into a campaign it becomes so engrossing it\u2019s difficult to think about anything else. Under its colorful, cartography-inspired art style and varied, stirring music that swells to accent what you\u2019re doing and in what era you\u2019re doing it, Civilization VI is crammed with an almost overwhelming number of systems. It\u2019s got trade, it\u2019s got religion, it\u2019s got espionage, it\u2019s got Great People, it\u2019s got archeology, it\u2019s got the kitchen sink. For the most part, that\u2019s awesome because there are so many chances to build out your nation in different ways to take advantage of opportunities on its randomly generated maps and pursue the different victory types, and it\u2019s all baked in at the ground level so that things like trade routes don\u2019t feel tacked on and optional (they are, in fact, the only way to build roads in the early game). This feels like a Civ game that\u2019s already had two expansions.  That can make the first few games feel overwhelming, even with the tutorials. The tutorials are good, but the amount of decisions you\u2019re prompted to make from the very beginning of a game that will have significant impact on your late-game success is intimidating. That said, as an experienced Civilization player I got up to speed relatively quickly and, on my second playthrough, was able to hold my own on King difficulty without understanding everything. I still feel like I\u2019m learning more and more with every game.  A lot of depth emerges from the new city-building system. \u201c A lot of depth emerges from one of the key factors that distinguishes this Civilization from the five that came before it: the new city-building system, in which key buildings like markets, temples, and barracks that have traditionally been built in nearly every city to give them basic functionality have now been broken out into 11 types of \u201cdistricts\u201d (Commercial Hub, Holy Site, and Encampment, among others). Those districts must be placed on tiles within a city\u2019s borders, and the number of districts you can build is limited by the population of a city, so you\u2019re forced to specialize each city\u2019s function. You might have one city that\u2019s focused on generating science for researching new technology, another focused on creating wealth, and another that builds your military units with experience boosts \u2013 or maybe you go full military and build an Encampment in all of them. It creates a lot of possible paths. What\u2019s more, Wonder buildings (which can only exist in one city in the world and grant big bonuses) also occupy tiles, and many are limited by geography because they must be placed next to a river or a mountain or other terrain, or they have prerequisite buildings you have to build first or adjacent to. All of this cuts down on previous games\u2019 Wonder spam, where one high-production city could crank out wonders quickly, and forces you to build them around your more diverse empire. It\u2019s also great that Wonders are so large and visible on the map, and that they come with impressive in-game animations of their construction.  Because we\u2019re playing on randomized maps every time, effectively laying out your cities\u2019 districts and Wonders is a challenging puzzle. There are loads of tradeoffs to consider, but the biggest is asking if you\u2019d be better off building a district or a Wonder or working the tile they\u2019d occupy for food and production resources, potentially allowing your city to grow bigger in the late game. Those are decisions that always feel like they matter. The land-grab phase feels urgent and exciting. \u201c Also, in a reversal of Civilization V\u2019s empire-wide happiness level system, in Civilization VI each city\u2019s happiness has reverted back to being individually determined, and is based on how many amenities it has available \u2013 happiness is created by luxury resources or happiness-generating buildings (plus a number of other factors). That means rapid empire expansion is back on the table because you don\u2019t need to worry about the founding of new cities having a major impact on the productivity and growth of your major ones, as long as you\u2019re settling in areas that have enough luxury resources to support them. In fact, settling as many new cities as possible feels all but mandatory if you want to be competitive, which makes the land-grab phase of the early- and mid-game eras feel urgent and exciting. Speaking of the mid game, the changes Firaxis has made to reduce unit clutter from that point on are extremely smart. The first problem in most Civilization games has been that at a certain point you (and all the AI players) get stuck with a dozen or so automated Worker units sitting around idling with no more city tiles to improve, which just makes turns take longer to calculate if you don\u2019t manually disband them. In Civilization VI, Workers (now called Builders) expire after they\u2019ve been used a few times \u2013 three, by default, but that can be expanded by government policies or wonders \u2013 they\u2019re no longer hanging around doing nothing. And if you need a new one, they\u2019re quick to build and affordable to immediately buy with gold. They can\u2019t be automated, either, which makes the decisions of where to spend their limited charges feel meaningful again as well.  Secondly, when Civilization V switched from allowing you to stack military units onto a single tile (as had been the custom through Civilization IV) to limiting you to one military unit per tile it created a more tactical kind of combat, but also caused an enormous traffic jam when you built a large army. Civilization VI gets that under control by finding a great compromise between stacks and one-unit-per-tile: once you research certain technologies you can combine two and then three identical military units into a single, more powerful corps or army unit (not entirely dissimilar to Civilization IV\u2019s Warlords). Thus the number of military units taking up space and blocking paths in the late game is sharply reduced by a half or even two-thirds, if you choose to take advantage of it. AI armies are also reduced, which means they have fewer things to shuffle around on their turns.  Those AI nations are each guided by one of the 20 available leaders, and each of them has agendas that guide their behavior. That gives diplomacy some much-needed transparency that\u2019s long been missing in Civilization games. Once you\u2019ve established a relationship with a leader through cozying up or espionage, you can see why they\u2019re happy or angry with you and what steps you might be able to take to change that. Egypt\u2019s Cleopatra, for example, likes other civilizations who have strong armies, and Queen Victoria likes nations that started on the same continent as England. They also have a randomized second agenda, such as preferring countries that have a high population or hating those who have more money than they do, so they\u2019re unpredictable in every new game. It\u2019s a big step toward demystifying their behavior. Some of these agendas are irrational, such as Queen Victoria disliking when you colonize a continent she has her eye on (there\u2019s no way to know which one) or German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa getting mad when you interact with City-States (which you\u2019d have to go out of your way not to do), so it\u2019s basically impossible to not anger someone at some point when you\u2019re simply going about your businesses of taking over the world. But you can mostly balance those offenses out by establishing embassies, conducting trade, respecting treaties, or just being friendly. The one downside I\u2019ve encountered is that in order to see what their motivations are you first have to have a level of access with them, and if you meet a new country in the mid game that dislikes you for unknown reasons it\u2019s very difficult to establish a good enough relationship to find out why they were angry in the first place. And they\u2019re not entirely consistent \u2013 they\u2019ll sometimes go from seemingly friendly to aggressive, presumably because they saw an opportunity they couldn\u2019t resist. (To be fair I\u2019ve been guilty of that one myself.) And one time I saw what must\u2019ve been a bug, where an AI first hated me for having a small navy but then for a few turns thought I had a huge navy before realizing I\u2019d never built a single ship and going back to hating me.   But Civilization VI\u2019s biggest weakness right now is that the AI has a bad habit of starting unprovoked wars, and that it isn\u2019t very good at fighting them. Even on high difficulty levels it fights by attempting to overwhelm you with numbers and technologically advanced units, so the challenge is in making use of tactics and support units, such as Great Generals and anti-air guns, to outmaneuver them. Winning isn\u2019t a cakewalk because you can crank up the difficulty until that\u2019s hard to do, but because of the AI\u2019s uncoordinated assaults you\u2019re unlikely to lose cities unless you\u2019re badly outgunned or you left them undefended. Some military victories feel unearned because the enemy army simply doesn\u2019t seem to know what it\u2019s doing. Somewhat related to that is Civilization VI\u2019s disappointing handling of religion. The process of spreading your faith to other cities for bonuses basically amounts to a very simple version of combat where there are only three units, and they don\u2019t change at all throughout thousands of years of history. That\u2019s not inconsistent with reality, but it\u2019s not that much fun to play. And while it is hilarious that Apostles and Inquisitors battle each other with lightning and mystical forces, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be enough to make me chase a religious victory by spreading my faith to more than half of the cities of every civilization on the map simply because of the monotony of it.  Back in the plus column we have the extremely customizable government system, which lets you assign bonus-giving policies to suit however you want to play. Each form of government, such as Monarchy, Theocracy, or Merchant Republic, is represented by a few inherent bonuses, but more importantly by a different configuration of military, economic, diplomatic, and wildcard policy slots; as you unlock new policy cards on the Civics tree (which is separate from but parallel to the Tech tree and powered by culture points) those policies can be added or removed. For instance, the Land Surveyors economic policy gives you 20% off the gold cost of buying new tiles for a city, while Public Works gives you 30% production boost toward new Builders and gives all new Builders two extra build actions. Military options include Logistics, which gives units +1 movement if starting in friendly territory and Professional Army, which gives you half off the gold cost of upgrading an obsolete military unit.  Mixing and matching policies can create a government to go with nearly any playstyle. \u201c There are dozens of these cards, and mixing and matching them can create a government to go with nearly any type of playstyle you could want. You can also build certain Wonders to expand the available slots in your government, which opens up a lot of possibilities to specialize in heavily stacking military, economic, or diplomatic bonuses. In practice I\u2019ve found that most Civics unlock in around 10 turns, so you\u2019re able to make those changes for free very frequently (and you can pay to do it at will, too). But maybe you shouldn\u2019t change your government type too often, because there are extra legacy bonuses for each government type are earned over time, encouraging you to stick with one for long periods of time to get the most out of it. It\u2019s a deep and multi-layered system that will take a lot of tinkering to fully figure out. 48 Images  Another of Civilization VI\u2019s novel concepts is that your progress on both the Civics tree and the Tech tree is helped along by research bonuses you get just by building, improving, or fighting. For instance, founding a city on the coast will boost your research toward Sailing, which cuts the number of turns required to unlock it in half. But maybe you don\u2019t have a good coastal location, so instead you kill three barbarian units (who can be extremely nasty harassers in the early game) and get a boost toward Bronze Working instead. This system lets the randomized map and the course of your civilization\u2019s events influence you to go down research paths you normally might not, which increases the diversity of your playthroughs. Plus, all the quotes representing each technology and civic are narrated by the pleasurably distinctive accent of Sean Bean. All of that translates to both online and hotseat multiplayer well, though I find the simultaneous turn-based online mode a bit messy because who attacks and who defends is determined by whoever moves that unit first, in real time. Currently there is no way to pre-make teams, and though you can just create alliances with your friends through the diplomacy screen, there\u2019s no team victory setting \u2013 there can be only one winner. I also had my only crash in all of Civ VI during a multiplayer game, and there was no way to rejoin it. On that note, Civilization VI runs very well on most systems I\u2019ve tried it on. Load times are a tad long when you first start or load into a saved game (it takes about a minute and 20 seconds to load into my current game off an SSD), though at least there we get to listen to Sean Bean\u2019s narration tell us how cool our chosen leader is. Once I\u2019m loaded in everything\u2019s been smooth, with only that one crash to desktop so far. For the first time in a Civilization game there\u2019s even a built-in benchmark tool, which on my GeForce GTX 970 has shown framerates between 50 and 75 per second. However, running it on a Surface Pro 4 with a Core i5 and integrated graphics was not very successful - the early game ran fine on minimum graphics settings, but loading up a late-game save was basically unplayable, even when using the cartoonish-looking tactical mode to minimize the impact on the graphics chip. That\u2019s a shame, because Civilization VI would make an excellent tablet game."

        "Content": "Overwatch exists at an intersection between design and artistry, a crossroad at which pure tactile joy meets refined, intelligent design to create a rare spark of magic. As a 6v6 multiplayer, objective-based shooter, it finds accessibility not by lowering the skill ceiling, but by broadening the definition of skill. The person with deadshot aim is no more valuable than the person with the decision-making ability to know when a well-timed ability will turn an engagement, or the person with the map-sense to find the optimal locations to place sentry turrets. While it didn't exactly drown me in options, maps, and modes, it\u2019s blessed with a multitude of tactical layers, and none of them ever came between me and my enjoyment of its intense, swirling teamfights, and thrilling overtime comebacks. Update: Overwatch is IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  Overwatch does a great many things well, but above all else, its success is built on the backs of its many excellent characters. It\u2019s fitting that the main menu is dominated by one of them at all times; their diverse appearances, origins, and personalities are all laid bare with every pose they strike. Reinhardt\u2019s rocket hammer lands on his shoulder with a meaty clank that invokes a broadsword resting against a medieval knight\u2019s plate armor, and Tracer\u2019s jovial smile is just briefly interrupted by a rebellious bang that slides across her face, tempting her to blow it back into place before re-addressing the camera and blinking all over the place. There\u2019s an intelligent gorilla scientist, a lithe, blue-skinned assassin, and a cybernetic, zen-practicing healer too. It speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here. They\u2019re all so different that you\u2019d imagine them looking silly standing next to one another, but through careful, subtle visual cues baked into their equipment and attire, they manage to appear as if they share a common world, even if they all hail from different corners of it. It speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here. \u201c This diversity continues to bear out when you pick a hero and hit the battlefield with them. Though the 21 characters (all of whom are unlocked from the start) are roughly grouped into one of four \u201croles,\u201d no two feel alike. The robotic, transforming Bastion and the anarchic, explosive-tossing Junkrat are both technically Defenders, but they couldn\u2019t play any more differently from one another. The former looks for a cozy spot overlooking a key choke point and transforms into a minigun turret to run point defense; the latter plays an area-denial game by lobbing timed grenades over long distances, which then sit on the ground blinking angrily, as if to say \u201cgo somewhere else\u201d to encroaching enemies before exploding. This strong sense of differentiation is important because it keeps team composition strategies from devolving into simple formulas. No, two Tanks, two Supports, and two Attackers is not the magic solution for a winning team. You have to look much deeper \u2013 and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch\u2019s gameplay shines through. Every Tool In The Box One of the surprising keys to surfacing these nuances is its refusal to offer up crutches to lean on. With very few arguable exceptions, no character is focused solely around one catch-all gun or skill to the extent that you can find success by using it alone. Tracer\u2019s dual machine-pistols have a high rate of fire but poor accuracy, a short clip, and middling damage if you aren\u2019t scoring headshots. Genji\u2019s shurikens are highly damaging and boast unerring accuracy, but their slow rate of fire and long travel time can make hitting a small moving target difficult. Almost every primary weapon fits this mold: they\u2019re useful, and in the right situation quite powerful, but never versatile enough to be a security blanket to constantly cling to. Not only do these little details help differentiate characters, they pushed me to explore their other abilities in search of success. You have to look much deeper \u2013 and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch\u2019s gameplay shines through. \u201c And once I started looking more closely, I couldn\u2019t stop discovering new things. Revisiting Junkrat\u2019s toolset, he doesn\u2019t have a single standard, reliable gun to just directly engage an enemy in front of him. Sure, he could skip grenades along the ground, leading his target as best he can, but even if you were good enough to reliably win one-on-one firefights this way, you wouldn\u2019t be realizing his full potential. At face value his other two skills \u2013 Steel Trap and Concussion Mine \u2013 seem straightforward. One immobilizes enemies that wander into it, the other blows them sky-high when triggered. In practice though, they can be so much more. Steel Trap can be an escape tool, allowing you to disengage from fights with faster enemies trying to get in your face. Its positional alert upon being triggered allows it to double as an early warning system too, letting you know that someone on the other team is attempting to flank your defenses and holding them there long enough for you to respond. Or, plant a Concussion Mine on top of a Steel Trap and just detonate it when you see it triggered while you\u2019re off somewhere else peppering the objective with grenades. You can even use Concussion Mine as a regular old grenade by tossing it at a group of enemies and detonating it manually as it gets there. Perhaps most amusingly, you can detonate it under yourself to rocket-jump up to otherwise-inaccessible areas. Just two abilities on one character opens up all those possibilities, and as you might imagine, once you get 12 characters scrapping over objectives, using their abilities to help and hurt one another, further layers of tactical nuance begin to unfurl. For example: On her own, Pharah can be a major headache by hurling herself high into the air and hovering there while raining rocket-propelled death down on opposing teams from angles that render both cover and positioning moot. But with Mercy the winged medic tending to her, Pharah becomes a whole different kind of problem. Mercy\u2019s Guardian Angel ability allows her to swoop toward any ally in range, even ones up in the sky. Combined with her ability to slow her descent with her wings, she's the only character that can follow Pharah wherever she goes. So you end up with a dynamic duo flying all over the place \u2013 the one shoving rockets down people's throats while the other switches between healing her up and buffing her already substantial damage output as needed. The sum of all these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical. \u201c Overwatch is rich with synergies like this: Reinhardt and Lucio, Zarya and Reaper, Torbjorn and Symmetra\u2026there's no shortage of opportunities for keen, coordinated play, and when you reach a point where you feel comfortable switching your character on the fly in the middle of a match to capitalize on weak enemy team composition, you feel like a tactical genius. You could spend many hours playing Overwatch before getting to that point by properly wrapping your brain around all the little intricacies it has tucked away behind its approachable veneer, but you certainly don't need to just to have a good time with it. Just trying out different characters, popping off their abilities, and moving through their world feels almost indescribably right, and it's all because of tiny, almost imperceptible details . The lid on Junkrat's grenade launcher flaps and clanks about with his every move, Lucio's movement has just the slightest touch of inertia, so you actually feel like you're skating when you play him. Zenyatta's reload animation might be my favorite; I never got tired of watching him open his arms to materialize a new set of orbs before clasping them together with a satisfying, metallic thud. It's a small thing, sure, but the sum of these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical. The Path To Victory Overwatch\u2019s 12 maps are similarly flush with luxuriant details, and they also play a big role in extracting further depth out of the cast\u2019s toolsets. The oppressive first chokepoint on Hanamura begs to have static defenses like Torbjorn\u2019s turret or Symmetra\u2019s sentries built around it, and for attackers with the right mobility skills (see Pharah and Mercy above) the long gap between the left side of the first and second capture point becomes a tantalizing opportunity to flank the defenders before they can reset themselves. Payload-escort maps like Route 66 provide high ground on either side of the attackers route, setting up paranoia-inducing ambush scenarios where Winston\u2019s spherical Shell Barrier becomes invaluable for protection against threats that could be coming from several angles at once. This adds another interesting layer of strategizing and decision making when coming up with team compositions. You aren\u2019t just thinking about how your character will work in the context of your team, but also about what opportunities any given map provides, and how you can exploit them. You\u2019re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there. \u201c Every map is directly tied to a specific objective type, so their construction is well-tailored to the action at hand. You never get that disjointed feeling of playing capture the flag on a team deathmatch map, like you might in other multiplayer shooters where maps have to accommodate a variety of modes. The upsides are subtle, but significant. Maps are focused without ever feeling constricted; there\u2019s never any question about where you\u2019re headed or how to get there, because every flanking path and side door eventually puts you where you need to be. In this way, Overwatch\u2019s map designs allow you to choose your vector of engagement without risking you getting lost where the action isn\u2019t happening. The result is zero wasted time; you\u2019re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there. Tying modes to maps in this one-to-one fashion has a small downside too though: Overwatch doesn\u2019t have a ton of different modes to switch things up like most other games of its kind do. This isn\u2019t Halo where most maps support various team sizes, objectives, and a slew of different modified rules. There\u2019s only one way to play on Volskaya Industries: it will always be attack the first point, then attack the second. This lack of customization allows for finely tuned action, but also cuts into the overall breadth and variety of the experience when compared to other modern multiplayer games. Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery. \u201c But like its characters, Overwatch\u2019s maps are filled with nuances that will take time and repetition to learn, and not just from a mechanical standpoint. Bits of story and world-building can be found throughout the beautifully conceived environments. Movie posters in the spawn room of one map reveal that the mech-piloting pro-gamer D.Va\u2019s real name is Hana Song, and that she had a movie career as well. Another map has a row of arcade machines, and if you happen to be playing as Genji, the cyber-ninja might start reminiscing about how many hours of his \u201cmisspent youth\u201d he burned away playing there. Sometimes characters who have a past and don\u2019t like each other find themselves on the same team, and you\u2019ll hear about it. Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery. In terms of features, Overwatch is just a bit thin, but it meets most of the basic expectations of a multiplayer shooter and in some ways, exceeds them. Its impressive stat-tracking, per-character control mapping, and accessibility options stand out. It also does a great job of identifying and surfacing good play to teammates and opponents through a novel commendation system and a sweet \u201cPlay of the Game\u201d highlight reel. Matchmaking is swift and reliable, and the cosmetic unlockables are surprisingly charming and come at a pretty decent pace without paying for extra loot packs. That said, I dug the characters' stock designs so much, I didn't want to stray too far from them anyway. "

        "Content": "There\u2019s an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player. \u201cWelcome to Dota 2!\u201d They say, with open arms, before concluding with, \u201cYou suck.\u201d They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.   Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that, after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a massive brawl where both teams of five colorful fantasy characters collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre. Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty \u2013 and that\u2019s totally justified. It\u2019s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels.  As such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. That sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but there\u2019s method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they\u2019d get from doing it themselves, and understanding  the effects  of hundreds of complex abilities like Bloodseeker\u2019s Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 102 heroes (and counting) fits you best is a time-consuming challenge.  Initially, you\u2019re thrown into the deep end to flounder, trying out any hero that makes the slightest bit of sense. The selection is bewildering: playing as Riki with his permanent invisibility from level 6 on is an obvious choice, as it's hard to kill what you can't see. Drow Ranger, perhaps, with her obscene damage the instant she unlocks her \"ultimate\" ability at level 6, and her slowing Ice Arrows that enable both escapes and setting up a kill. On the more complex end of the spectrum you have choices like the armour-manipulating Templar Assassin, or the incredibly mobile Storm Spirit, who can dart around the battlefield and avoid damage by simply not being in the wrong place at the wrong time. On top of that there are well over 100 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways of manipulating and enhancing your stats and suite of active abilities.  Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best \u2013 you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home in a hurry.  To grasp the subtleties of how heroes interact and fight you have to do more homework on the different kinds of damage and how they\u2019re mitigated; how to prevent one type of spell from affecting you, and when you use that countermeasure; how the different kinds of aggro work, and when you need to manipulate them; the timers (which aren't made visible), and how to optimise your play around them.   Even after all that, to avoid being caught at a disadvantage you must be taught the nuanced techniques that can make or break games, which Dota 2 seems to almost belligerently hide from new players. Tricks like pulling a group of neutral monsters out of their home so that a new group can spawn to effectively double the rewards are never hinted at. This forced me to read and educate my outside of Dota 2, which had the positive effect of introducing me to the player community and making me feel like a part of it. It's almost like an oral tradition that binds together a tribe.  This is a balancing system that could only exist in a game where everybody has access to all heroes, and Valve wisely obliges. All of Dota 2, including its growing cast of 102 characters, is available from the moment you complete the all-too-brief tutorial. And that delicate system can only survive if the items for sale have zero effect on gameplay.  Again, Valve has come through. Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community and held to a very high standard, and tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. There\u2019s not a single paid advantage that could have the slightest impact on the in-game balance, and that\u2019s an amazing situation unrivalled among Dota 2\u2019s closest competition.  Pretty much everything I've praised Dota 2 for, outside of being totally free, is taken directly from the outstanding original mod. Where Valve has taken initiative to make Dota 2 a significantly better experience is in everything surrounding it, including improving the pre-game matchmaking interface, supporting the community of professional and avid players, and even allowing artists to create and sell cosmetic items on the Dota 2 store.   Perhaps most important are the steps Valve has taken toward taming the hyper-competitive community. Besides matchmaking, guilds, and a wide variety of different game modes, the things that Valve hasn\u2019t done are just as noticeable than the things it has. For example, there\u2019s no concede button to throw in the towel on a losing match, and though you earn a matchmaking rank to ensure you're placed competitively, it's not visible to other players. If withholding those features seems like a bad idea on the surface, their sacrifice was not in vain \u2013 it prevents irritable players from dropping out of a match at the first sign of defeat, or when they're teamed up with people whose stats don't meet their exacting standards \u2013 a real frustration in other MOBAs.  LIkewise, Valve recognized that less is more when it comes to unlockables. There\u2019s no progression outside of the game that will have the slightest mechanical effect inside of it. Without artificial goals to aim for, the matches are left with a strong and refreshing sense of fairness and purity, where everything that can influence success or failure is right there on the battlefield and in your head.  In my personal experience, Valve\u2019s ideas work. I've played for over 1,000 hours, and my encounters with people unwilling to act decently towards their fellow players have become increasingly rare over the course of Dota 2\u2019s development. It has never been more friendly than it is now \u2013 though that\u2019s a relative comparison. Even with these enhancements, the best way to play Dota 2 will always be with a team of four friends.   Valve\u2019s dogged desire to preserve DOTA's design perfectly is a double-edged sword in some ways. There are a few design choices that feel needlessly archaic and slavish to the original, such as the way Blink Dagger will arbitrarily shave 200 units of movement from your blink if you overestimate the distance, or how the towers will occasionally refuse to acknowledge your attempts to turn aggro away from yourself during a siege. They feel like relics of previous era, traditions carried on for the sake of tradition. As for its future prospects, things look bright for Dota 2. Each year of its long beta period is defined by huge balance patches that make widespread changes to keep things fresh and interesting. Given Valve\u2019s excellent ongoing support of Team Fortress 2, its other free-to-play game, it\u2019s a safe bet that there will always be something to learn and something new to master for the foreseeable future. Patches are released on a weekly basis, and on any given day there are multiple professional games to watch. Even the cosmetics are constantly changing, with community chests and themed events occurring regularly throughout the year. Dota 2 isn\u2019t static in any sense of the word, from the wild variety of each game to the overarching sense that it will never be finished being made."

        "Content": "Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch looks familiar, archetypical and even safe, but underneath the hood, it\u2019s none of those things. While developer Level-5 has stayed the course with many conventions of the genre, it\u2019s likewise bucked the disturbing trend in JRPGs of emphasizing all of the wrong things, instead focusing on what any game that demands dozens of hours should: roping you in with solid gameplay, complemented by a wonderful story told by characters you care about. As such, Ni No Kuni gets its hooks into you almost immediately, and it refuses to let go. We\u2019ve come a long way since the glory days of the Japanese role-playing game in the 1990s. Indeed, many would argue that perhaps we\u2019ve come too far. Today, the genre is split between the heavily watered-down and the absurdly niche. This leaves many of us floating somewhere in the middle, in the well-worn ether that, for some reason, too few developers and publishers have dare tread in the 21st century. But with Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, Level-5 has delivered something special: a JRPG that feels like the games of yore, looks like the games of tomorrow, and draws heavy inspiration from the classics old-school JRPGs fans adore. Oliver and his friends. Ni No Kuni\u2019s story revolves around a young boy named Oliver. Oliver is a citizen of Motorville, a serene hamlet seemingly ripped out of a photograph of 1950s America. What stands out about Oliver is how good-natured and kind he is; he\u2019s not the badass, sword-wielding Any Hero of many games, and this is one of Ni No Kuni\u2019s strongest points. You\u2019re not playing as a brutish warrior or a devilish rogue. You\u2019re playing as a young boy with a pure \u2013 albeit broken \u2013 heart. Oliver gets along swimmingly with his mother, is polite to adults, and is pleasant to be around. He\u2019d rather do his homework and talk about cars than cause any problems. All of this is super important, because Oliver\u2019s nature is the central pillar of Ni No Kuni\u2019s plot, not his physical strength, mental fortitude or arcane abilities. When his world suddenly falls apart around him after an unfortunate event early in the game, Oliver is briefly stirred, but his true nature shines through. Indeed, Oliver doesn\u2019t have an axe to grind. He\u2019s not out for personal glory. He finds his adventure and stumbles upon the group of characters that ultimately accompany him not because he\u2019s hurt, but because he wants to fix what\u2019s wrong with him and those around him. This drew me in and made me care about Oliver and his unusual quest. I didn\u2019t care about his stat progression or equipment loadout nearly as much as I cared about him as a person, and his ability to do endless amounts of good for a world (or worlds) hell-bent on standing in his way. Ni No Kuni\u2019s core gameplay is most reminiscent of a Tales game running headlong into Pokemon, with Ni No Kuni taking equal amounts of both games\u2019 battle systems and melding their features into something fun, coherent and rewarding. Ni No Kuni draws from Pokemon in an obvious way; it emphasizes fighting with creatures you capture in battle. These creatures are called Familiars, and you\u2019ll randomly be able to capture any creature you fight. Familiars can level up, equip weapons and armor and even evolve into stronger forms. The beauty of the system, however, is that it also takes a page out of Pokemon\u2019s book in terms of longterm execution. You don\u2019t need to capture every creature and level it up to ungodly heights. You can capture a dozen of them through the course of the game and be just fine, but there\u2019s more there to explore and take advantage of if you choose to spend the time necessary to do so. On the other side of the coin, the Tales influence comes from the battle system itself. While you\u2019ll be using Familiars in battle (in addition to fighting in battles yourself, should you so choose), those battles take place in open spaces and occur in real-time. So Ni No Kuni instantly becomes about more than pressing the X button and hoping for (or simply expecting) the best. Instead, it\u2019s about maneuvering around enemies, finding weak spots and openings, switching in and out Familiars on the fly and occasionally resorting to Oliver and his human friends so they can use items and special moves, from spellcasting to mid-battle thievery. This adds layers of much-welcome depth. Battling certainly rests at the crux of Ni No Kuni, but there\u2019s a flood of content that swirls around the mere act of fighting, and this content draws voluminous amounts of charm out of the game. While Ni No Kuni\u2019s narrative progression is largely linear and easy enough to follow, the game\u2019s side quests run the gamut from standard and peculiar to unique and heartwarming. These side quests \u2013 called Errands \u2013 follow the typical JRPG protocol of \u201cdo this, get this,\u201d but then again, the approach is entirely different. Unspeakable evil. Instead of simply fetching an item for someone \u2013 which admittedly does happen on occasion \u2013 you\u2019ll instead be expected to cure a character\u2019s broken heart. The broken-hearted masses rest at\u2026 well\u2026 the heart of Ni No Kuni, and it just so happens that Oliver\u2019s magical prowess can help save them. Whether a character lacks courage or kindness or even love, Oliver can take those pieces of heart from people who have too much and deliver them to those who are wanting. By following through with these side quests \u2013 of which there are scores \u2013 you\u2019ll see Oliver for who he is: an unusually kind person. (There\u2019s another class of side quest called Hunts, which are your typical \u201ckill this enemy for me\u201d tasks, and those are fun and rewarding too. But not nearly as rewarding as helping those around you.) The real beauty of this system, however, is that there\u2019s a tangible reward for completing side quests \u2013 whether errand or hunt-based \u2013 beyond the mere earning of coins and provisions. Ni No Kuni cleverly places within the grander narrative a metagame that\u2019s entirely contingent on completing side quests. For completing them, you get tangible rewards, but you also get stamps on Merit Cards. The harder the quest, the more stamps you get, and each card of 10 stamps can be turned in for special rewards. Rewards range from getting more experience in battle to capturing Familiars more easily, and just about everything in between. This metagame becomes addicting the longer you play the game, exponentially increasing the likelihood of finding solutions to even the most difficult (and at times obnoxious) tasks. While Level-5 did a wonderful job of concocting a worthy game, Ni No Kuni\u2019s most overt draw is in how it looks, and for that, you need to look outside of the game\u2019s developer and into the firm actually responsible for the graphics: Studio Ghibli, perhaps the most famous anime producer in the world. Ni No Kuni is unquestionably gorgeous; its stellar aesthetic transcends each and every inch of the game. You\u2019ll see a vista and think to yourself \u201cthis is the most beautiful scene in the game.\u201d Then, you\u2019ll see something an hour later and you\u2019ll think the same thing. This happens over and over again, because Ni No Kuni looks that much better than a vast majority of games on the market. Ni No Kuni also contains an exceptional soundtrack, which always seems to hit the right notes (pardon the pun) for every situation. The music is catchy and memorable, but it also stirs emotion and draws you into the experience in ways few gaming soundtracks do. The composition of each individual track is adeptly executed \u2013 the music was written by famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi, after all \u2013 but it\u2019s brought to even greater heights by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The game\u2019s voice acting is also good for the most part, though Oliver\u2019s voice acting is perhaps the most disappointing, which is unfortunate considering he\u2019s the main character. The good news is that you can keep Japanese voice acting on and read along with the game\u2019s subtitles. Either way, you get to take advantage of Ni No Kuni\u2019s extraordinary Western localization, expertly translated and delivered, and no doubt the reason the game took so long to leave Japan. Then again, everything taken into consideration, it was well worth the wait."

        "id": "bdcaaec5e090562154eb2cecbdf2060a",
        "Content": "Okami was, without doubt, one of the PlayStation 2\u2019s finest hours. A majestic riff on the Zelda archetype, its sprawling adventure was steeped in traditional Japanese culture, folklore and art, making it one of the most distinct yet holistic titles on the system. Okami HD represents the definitive version of the game, elevating its already incredible art direction to new heights. Simply put, Okami was destined to be played in 1080p 4K, and here it is. Okami\u2019s world is nothing if not a classical vision of Japan past. Rural life is celebrated, power is centralised in the hands of emperors and kings, tradition is embraced and mystical forces play an active role in the lives of its people. Into this world an ancient evil has awakened, spreading corruption across the land, and the sun goddess Amaterasu - in the form of a wolf - must restore peace and tranquillity. One of the reasons Okami is such a success is that every element of its design complements every other element. The hand-drawn ink and watercolour styling of its world, for instance, flows elegantly through to its gameplay. It\u2019s no accident that the sky has a thick paper texture and distant mountains are often little more than a few simple ink lines. In Okami, the world itself is a canvas, manipulated through the player\u2019s most valuable tool: the Celestial Brush. Freeze frame the mountain scene I just described and you can draw a circle in the sky to turn night into day, or a crescent to turn day into night. It\u2019s an unbelievably potent concept, and one that Okami absolutely delivers on. Over the course of the game, Amaterasu learns 13 core brush techniques, and they\u2019re nothing short of magical. By drawing the right icon, players can make dead trees bloom, repair broken bridges and machinery, slow down time and summon gusts of wind, spouts of water, bombs and more. The Celestial Brush mechanic isn\u2019t just a great thematic companion to the art style, but crucial to every aspect of the gameplay. In the wider world, players use it to solve basic puzzles and get around. Need to traverse a stretch of water? Create a lily pad and hop on, then draw a gust of wind to blow Amaterasu to her destination. Want to get up into a tree? Grapple up there by drawing a line between the flower above it and Amaterasu. It\u2019s the classic Zelda school of game design, where each technique opens up new possibilities for exploration and treasure hunting. Of course, the Celestial Brush is invaluable in combat too; the exclamation point on Amaterasu\u2019s flurried melee attacks. In these sequences the brush can become a sword that can slice an enemy in half, or a machine gun capable of peppering them with rapid-fire ink bullets. The combat in this game isn\u2019t difficult - and there aren\u2019t many enemies that demand more than rudimentary tactics - but there are some neat touches nonetheless. Some enemies must be attacked from behind with the brush, while others require the player to knock back their projectiles to open them up to attack. You get the idea. Everywhere you look in Okami, traditional Japanese culture and folklore shines through. Shintoism and its belief in the spirit world permeates the game, while many of the enemy designs are informed by Japanese mythology. Even the societal roles of the world\u2019s inhabitants evoke a classical Japan. Oh, and how many games can you think of where the treasures you find are things like lacquerware sets and incense burners? It\u2019s all dealt with playfully, however. Amaterasu, for instance, has a delightful duality. At once a powerful goddess, capable of making sweeping changes to the world, she's also in turn a wolf pup, digging into the earth in search of treasure. The brush gods also walk this line, often revealing themselves in bizarre and slapstick cutscenes. Yes, a rich vein of humour runs throughout Okami \u2013 helped along by a sterling translation \u2013 and this is best exemplified by the player's travelling companion, the diminutive wandering artist Issun. His role is both expository and comedic; he brings a levity to conversations and provides the perfect yin to the silent protagonist's yang. Our two leads are joined by some memorable supporting characters too. In fact, while the tale is framed as the sun goddess\u2019 quest to restore the land of Nippon, Amaterasu doesn\u2019t do it alone. The first major portion of the game sees Ammy repeatedly crossing paths with Susano, a descendant of the legendary warrior that \u2013 alongside the white wolf Shiranui \u2013 slayed the great beast that has now returned. Initially a comedic figure \u2013 lazy, something of a drunkard, all pretense but no skill \u2013 he eventually becomes far more. Similarly, Waka is a powerful, mysterious figure with a lightsaber sword and French affectations, who regularly turns up to make enigmatic pronouncements about the future. He\u2019s also not above doing Amaterasu\u2019s job for her. Much of the opening dozen or so hours, for instance, sees Amaterasu restoring Guardian Saplings to full bloom, but when they arrive in the coastal region of North Ryoshima, Waka has already restored its Sapling, reinforcing the fact that Ammy is not the only driving force of this story. This is a game full of twists and surprises. Over the course of Okami HD, players will venture to an underwater kingdom, go inside the belly of a beast, puppeteer an Emperor, scale an absolutely epic tower, watch a character set off for the stars in a bamboo rocket ship, and so much more. The dungeons are never hugely challenging, but they're satisfying nonetheless. It\u2019s an enormous game too; dozens of hours long for those that want to smell the roses. As grand and compelling as Okami is, it\u2019s perhaps not as taut in some areas as it could be. Cutscenes can drag on a little, for instance, while the camera \u2013 particularly during combat \u2013 isn\u2019t always the player\u2019s friend. There\u2019s almost too much to collect, as well, and while \u2018praise\u2019 (earned by completing tasks, restoring the world and feeding animals you come across) helps players expand core attributes, and money (earned by defeating monsters and selling treasure) can be used to buy new moves and items, the game\u2019s power-ups add little. You simply won\u2019t need these \u2013 or even think to use them \u2013 in the vast majority of combat scenarios, and so discovering them in treasure chests across the land is something of a letdown. You can always sell them, of course. It\u2019s also worth pointing out a few minor issues with the presentation. First though, I really do need to underline that as a whole Okami HD is jaw-droppingly pretty. Its minimal, artistic aesthetic translates incredibly well to 1080p and looks absolutely phenomenal. There are countless flourishes that add appreciably to the experience as well, such as the shifting colours of the plants and flowers that spring up behind Amaterasu as she gains speed. That said, it\u2019s a shame the pop-in wasn\u2019t pushed back in this version. Players still can\u2019t see more minor objects in the environment until they get relatively close. You\u2019ll also occasionally see brightly coloured polygonal base character models in the world from a distance. It\u2019s only a momentary thing before the character\u2019s texture pops in, but it happens. Finally, as you\u2019d expect, Okami HD incorporates Move functionality, but why you\u2019d choose to play this way I\u2019m not sure. Yes, there\u2019s greater responsiveness to the brush movements, but the upshot is that it\u2019s actually harder to use. Slashing at an enemy with the brush, for instance, requires the player to draw a straight line through the enemy in question, and this is easier with the analogue stick than a highly sensitive motion controller. You\u2019ll certainly adapt to the Move controls, but everything is either slightly less intuitive or slightly clunkier. Using the D-pad or a combination of the square button/motion to manipulate the camera, for instance, is awkward \u2013 particularly in combat, while the button layout simply isn\u2019t as user friendly. My advice \u2013 ignore Move and stick to a pad."

A 200lbs school bully whose intimidating bulk pushed a dozen weedier triple-A titles into 2010. The most-anticipated game of the year \u2013 the decade, even, if you believe the TV ad's breathless hyperbole. The sequel to the 13 million-plus-selling original with a Metacritic rating of 94% and an IGN score of 9.4. A media event with no less than 35 videos already sitting on IGN's servers and 102 features. Google takes 0.12 seconds to find 38 and a half million hits. And that's a long time for Google. And it's not even been released yet. How? You sit down. And you play it.  And around seven hours later, with campaign completed on regular difficulty, you'll feel like you've just burped and crossed the cutlery on one of the gaming meals of your life. This is the Gordon Ramsey of games: aggressive, confident, spectacular, sweary and garnished with essence of pure testosterone. And you'll need a similar long sit down and a nap afterwards. You'll have travelled a Bond-style tour around the world from the streets and caves of Afghanistan to the snowy wastes of Kazakhstan via the edge of Earth's atmosphere, the sweaty favelas of Rio and even stomped mud across that famous eagle rug in the Oval Office.   In action, Modern Warfare 2 looks incredible.  So, to set down the mundane, need-to-know stuff. If you've played the first game, you know the score. 17 missions are played out on two fronts: from the perspective of the US Rangers and through the eyes of Task Force 141 \u2013 an elite squadron of special ops, mostly ex-SAS nut jobs. A Russian warlord called Makarov has filled the power vacuum left by your killing of Zakhaev at the end of the first game, and you counter his evil shenanigans down the iron sights, sniper scopes and electronic missile locks of various bad ass weapons. And a side arm. Only two weapons though, no more. The Ranger missions are mostly played out in the US, Task Force 141 does the globe-trotting in the more exotic locales. There are lots and lots and lots of bad guys between you and your various mission objectives, and they'd very much like to kill you, in the face.  But this string of words can't come close to encapsulating the experience of Modern Warfare 2, which is of course why you're laying down your 55-odd notes. And this experience is truly like few others. Whatever you may think of Infinity Ward , these chaps are very, very good at generating the kind of controlled pandemonium that is the yardstick for engrossing war games. And we can confidently stick a flag in the sand and proclaim that Modern Warfare sets new standards in molar compressing, bumhole squeezing, punch you in the eyes battlefield immersion. It's a game where it could be prudent to slap up signs on either side of your monitor, one, in capitals saying: \"BLINK!\" and the other: \"BREATHE!\"  And make no mistake, this is an adult game. The already famously controversial scene in the Moscow airport, where you can pull the trigger on countless innocent civilians trying to flee in utter panic is probably the most uncomfortable five minutes of gaming we've ever experienced. You can choose to not pull the trigger if you want, but doesn't that rather defeat the object? Even more disturbing is a stealth kill later in the game where the developers' view has you staring intently and unflinchingly into the eyes of a slowly dying henchmen from the combat knife you've just slammed into his chest. Infinity Ward is unflinchingly staring down the barrel of a media shit-storm it knows is inevitable, but will certainly make this a game to remember. Could both of these incidents be played out as non-interactive cut-scenes without compromising artistic integrity? The easy answer here is absolutely yes, but this one's isn't going to go away any time soon. And will be discussed at length by people much more clever \u2013 and much, much dumber \u2013 than us.   Spec Ops is great fun and works well in split-screen as well as online.  So what didn't we like? Well, with the right foot planted firmly on the gas pedal, there's little or no time for this game to breathe and evolve like the first Modern Warfare, which is to its detriment. If you have ambitions to be treated like a blockbuster movie, you have to understand pacing. Also, bar the \"No Russian\" airport mission, which will stand out for all the wrong reasons, this game just doesn't boast the set-pieces \u2013 the sniper level, the gunship level \u2013 that made the first game stand out so memorably. Targets can often be very confusing; maybe it's our tired, old eyes but in the pandemonium, however entertaining, we often had immense difficulty in telling American special ops, camo-sporting soldiers from Russian special ops, camo-sporting soldiers. The result is an awful lot of collateral damage, most of which is sprayed out of your machine gun of choice. Also, take a moment to step away from the gung ho experience, and you'll see that Infinity Ward spends a lot of time repeating tricks so successful in the first game \u2013 you'll encounter a great deal of gaming deja vu on this journey, even if it's artfully misdirected with the best and most cunning smoke and mirrors in the business.   Visually, it's also stunning, with a few caveats. The sheer scale of this Michael Bay-huge canvas is never less than awe-inspiring, dishing out a scale of missions that few developers would even consider sticking on the drawing board, and delivering them with style and aplomb. Character detail and animation is crisp, assured and convincing. Your weaponry never feels anything but super authentic, but just don't give the local flora and fauna too much attention as it doesn't bear much close scrutiny and could well have been hewn from finest cardboard.   Once the action kicks off it never lets up.  And as game plotters, Infinity Ward make great gunsmiths. The plot is absolutely as convoluted, baffling and head scratchy as the first one. We've played it through and we'd struggle to relate to man or beast more than 50 per cent of what's supposed to have happened and, even more worrying, still haven't a Scooby why the main plot twist in the game happens or the motivation behind it. In Modern Warfare, like any war, it seems shit happens, and you deal with it then read it back on Wikipedia when you've finished, no doubt sparing a thought for a cast of characters more expendable than a minivan-full of American teens visiting that log cabin with the eerie music coming from it, where that serial killer is rumoured to have died.  Then we have the multiplayer. While we haven't played it as extensively as we'd liked at the time of writing, what we've played is suitably impressive. Special Ops allows you to go back and replay a selection of areas co-operatively against an increasing number of enemies via split-screen, system link or online with one chum. So far, so Horde or Firefight, but there's still loads to get your teeth into, even if the two-player cap disappoints. And then, of course, there's the much-vaunted multiplay, which takes the excellent experience from the first game and tweaks and improves it. It wasn't broken, so there's little to fix, but the multikill rewards are slicker and far more satisfying, and the levelling up, which you get live during the games, is pleasingly zingy.   If multiplayer is your bag you're well catered for here. "

        "Content": "Guys like me that have been into gaming since before there were even graphics to bitch about have often hopped on our high horse and proclaimed today's games to be so coddling and hand-holding that one can't possibly get the same sense of accomplishment as the experiences in the days of yore. It's a bunch of old man chest thumping (for the most part), of course, but games going back even to the days of the NES often lacked the ability to save progress or even continue if you burned through all your lives. Demon's Souls isn't quite that hardcore, but it is a wonderfully unique experience that delivers a risk/reward setup that most games couldn't even dream of trying to match.  Just how punishingly old-school is Demon's Souls? That's something that's rather hard to quantify without actually shoving a controller in your hands and just letting you play it for yourself, but nearly everything about the game's no-nonsense approach to delivering the action can be summed up in one very simple example: you can't pause the game. Ever. If you're in the middle of a pitched battle against enemies that can and very often will end your life in just a single hit or two, you'd better hope that whatever weapons or restoratives you have in your inventory are already mapped to the d-pad slots, and even then it'll take a bit of luck to get through some encounters.   Click the image to watch Demon's Souls in action.  Let me expand on that a little further. When you do bring up the Start Button menu, the one that gives you access to inventory, equipment and the status of both yourself and the world's light/dark tendencies, your character can only run around; all your other actions are used to guide the menu navigation. Those light/dark tendencies? They determine how tough enemies are in a level and dying can cause the world to shift to dark, meaning the game can get harder if you die too much .  Are you getting a sense of the kind of stacked odds that are against you? This is not a game for those that milk their savegame states or reset the console when something goes wrong. In fact, Demon's Souls almost constantly auto-saves. Remember that recent death or munching on those items or accidentally killing off one of the main vendors in the game? Yeah, that's all permanent. You can't sell your old equipment for cash (which, by the way, doubles as experience, so you can level up your character, his or her existing equipment or buy new weapons and armor, but rarely will you have enough cash to do all three). Oh, and perhaps the most amusingly brutal part of the Demon's Souls experience? If you die, you lose all that cash/experience (unless you can run all the way back through the level to where you died and reclaim your soul with all those enemies you killed off now alive and thirsty for fresh blood).   Enjoy all that light; it won't last long. There's no bank, no second chances, no way to put off the inevitable. You will die in this game. When in this soulless form, you'll be permanently stripped of a chunk of your life meter. You will lose all of your cash, and you will hate that every once in a while it's because you got pushed (okay, you accidentally rolled) off a cliff. But you'll keep coming back because the game is quite simply one of the best on the PlayStation 3.   Those two main themes might seem at odds with each other. How can someone who has been cut down hundreds of times, been attacked by an ultra-powerful strike from an enemy he didn't even see coming, ganged up on by four or five guys that could by themselves probably end a game, how can they possibly call this a must-have experience? It's not just fogey nostalgia powering the absolute love I have for this game, I promise; it's the almost euphoric feeling that will come from finally besting one of the end-level bosses and raking in tons of cash along with a free pass to head back to The Nexus, the game's hub world and only real place of safety. There's a blissful sense of relief, of knowing you've overcome all those ridiculous odds to triumph, and to the victor goes the spoils -- except in this case the knowledge of enemies and their tactics often weigh more heavily than any purse of spare souls coughed up by a slain boss.   If you see Ol' Red this close, you're probably already dead.  This is Demon's Souls' true gift -- a glimpse into a world that is so bleak, so downtrodden, so weathered by the passage of time and malevolent or all-powerful forces that it seems utterly hopeless... until you fix it. You'll meet your end plenty of times while doing it, but each death in Demon's Souls is a neatly packaged learning experience. For every cheap slip down a chasm or tumble over the edge of a staircase that sends you plummeting hundreds of feet to your death, there are dozens upon dozens that will teach you the cold, hard truths of this world: nearly every enemy (particularly early on) is a potential life-ender, and a proper defense and careful use of your equipped weapon are paramount in every. Single. Encounter.  The sense of pervasive dread and creeping tension is flat-out amazing, and may well contribute to the dizzying highs experienced when you've beaten a particular level. No game in recent memory has rewarded smart, careful play and punished overly-gutsy or foolishly heroic actions quite like Demon's Souls. It's not cheap or unfair, really, it's relentlessly stern, and like a drill instructor, the repeated sapping of all your hard work that seems like the game is just punishing you eventually clicks and you see those deaths for the key bits of training they are.  Chances are, though, even after hundreds or even thousands of deaths, you won't ever really know the breadth of what the game offers in terms of character classes, variety of weapons, rare drops, different equipment trade-offs or particular spells. That's because, even with an incredible wiki formed by importers that picked up the game when it was released in Asia a while back, there's simply too much to do in this game to get it all in one go.  Much of this comes down to the game's flexibility; both long- and short-range battles are important, though going about them is completely up to you. Want to be a magic user that roasts enemies from afar? No problem. Want to be an armor-clad brute that pulverizes foes with weapons no ordinary person could pick up, much less swing effectively? Easily done. Ah, but do you want to be someone in-between, a poker with magicks and a slicer with blades? Or would you like to use a bow? How about enchanted weapons? Each of them has a role to play, and if you choose to adhere to that role, you can jump into the startlingly unique online mode, which I'll get to in a second.   Duelin' Phantoms Let's delve a bit into the depth of the melee combat for a second, though, because it's ridiculously varied. Each weapon has its own animations for normal and heavy strikes, and those change yet again if you wield them with two hands vs. one. If you toss a shield onto the other while one-handing a weapon, you're able to block incoming attacks or even bat them away with a parry, which opens the enemy up to critical strikes. Some weapons will allow you to block and strike, while others require both. Along with the differences in play style come the stat requirements and practice with attack speeds, damage dealt, the ability to dodge and roll... Are you getting the idea here? There's more in just the combat alone to give players a reason to go through the game more than once.  Again, though, the game simply rewards choice. When upgrading your stats, any class can pour souls into any of the eight governing categories. Yes, you can start as a bruiser, but if the urge to cast a few spells or outfit yourself with protective miracles (think white magic vs. the \"dark\" of spells) hits early enough, you can make that happen. The catch, of course, is that with every buff to your stats, your Soul Level goes up, and thus the requirement for pouring more souls into any category increases. Remember too that souls are key to leveling up and buying/repairing/upgrading equipment. Same goes for buying new spells or miracles. And, of course, if you die, you lose that pool of cash/experience.   While the game is certainly playable all by one's lonesome, it's not the true Demon's Souls experience. For that, you'll have to explore the game's quirky and seemingly limited online mode. There's no voice chat. There's no text chat. There's no lobby, no matchmaking system (at least in the traditional sense) and no out-of-game invite system. No, to find people in Demon's Souls, you'll have to make use of Stones, and these too are guided by some particular rules. By dropping a stone while in a non-corporeal state, you can leave a marking on the ground for those that are still alive, allowing them to pull you into your game where you'll earn souls, but you can't pick up any other items. When \"whole\", you can recruit others to help you get past particularly tough levels or take on bosses. In either situation, you'll have to make use of only a simple gesture-based communication menu by holding down the X button for about five seconds (or using the slightly wonky SIXAXIS shortcuts), but they work surprisingly well and add to the slightly ethereal, disconnected feeling of the worlds.   Welcome to Boletaria Palace The online implementation is definitely Japanese in that it doesn't embrace full, real-time, voice-based communication between players, but there are unique touches too. As you play through the game, you'll notice other players in the area fighting their own versions of the same monsters. These white wisps are reminders that you're only a fragmented dimension away from being able to play with them, and when they die, the last few seconds of their life is recorded as a bloodstain you can touch to play back their final moments -- often serving as something of a warning when in new areas. The only way to reach across these dimensions outside of joining someone's game is to leave a sometimes cryptic message built from pre-written sentences that can warn of upcoming danger or indicate a good guy around the bend. These, though, can also be dropped as particularly evil little \"help\" messages that encourage players to jump blindly off a ledge in search of treasure only to meet their death if you so choose, but a voting system does help weed out some of the less honest bits of help -- unless of course a bunch of equally evil people recommend the false message too.  In fact, the disconnected nature of Demon's Souls' online interactions helps encourage the kind of break from social norms that being anonymous online has done in message boards. You can be a complete ass in this game and delight in the misfortunes of others. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the ability to invade other people's games as a Black Phantom. When giving in to the Dark Side, you can entice enemies to attack the player, and of course can do it yourself, effectively ruining their careful exploration. There's a level limit to keep end game Black Phantoms from just rolling up and insta-killing newcomers (you can't even interact with other players until you beat the first boss and get the necessary stones), but toward the end of the game, ten levels can mean the difference between some wildly different bits of equipment or spells depending on how characters have been leveled up over the course of their travels.   The scale is epic . Late-game Black Phantom invasions can result in completely broken equipment, a variety of status effects being applied and some absolutely epic fights... or they can be over in seconds. Of course, in a nice bit of Karmic Revenge, any Black Phantom that dies by a means other than a player loses their Soul Level, making watching one of those jerks falling off a cliff feel that much more satisfying. By the same token, one could choose to redeem himself by using his immunity to enemies to kill everything in sight and then sacrifice himself at the end of a level to the player he invaded, but I wouldn't count on that happening too much. For those that dedicate themselves to seeing the \"bad\" ending of the game, another stone will allow them to duel with other players while wagering souls pre-battle.   The differences in any of these states, from Blue (helpful) to Black (invading) Phantoms, to Soul (dead, but dealing more damage) or Body (alive, but attracting more enemy attention and doing less damage) Forms means you can play the game in a variety of ways. If you factor in the shifts that can happen when going from Dark to Light tendencies in a particular world (some areas will only open up once an area has completely bend to one end of the spectrum), what was already a deep game becomes a chasm of replay value, adaptability and reward.   Yes, that's a boss. Likely only your second , and yes, there are bigger ones than that. It also helps that playing online will allow you to see more of the world, which is in and of itself one hell of a treat. From Software has built for themselves one of the most imaginative takes on a traditional medieval-style \"Western\" universe I've ever seen. The idea that this is a traditional swords-and-sorcery adventure with dragons and wizards and such will fade a bit the first time you see some of the more whacked-out creature designs (and no, I'm not going to spoil them; seeing some of the monstrous bosses in this game for the first time is something everyone should get to experience unfettered), but the sheer scale and use of clever level design to help reveal areas that you'll either eventually get to or visual callbacks to where you were a few hours back are amazing indeed. That the game supplies multiple \"shortcuts\" to earlier areas as a reward for exploring in some levels is welcome indeed.  That's not to say all those huge dragons and massive, crumbling castles are rendered absolutely flawlessly, though. Yes, the game's detailed, normal mapped textures and clever enemy designs all move with either listless shambles or surprisingly quick darts, but in great numbers -- particularly when there are a lot of extra objects used as clutter or to break up what would normally be a big, empty space -- the framerate can take some serious dives. These are usually brief, and things return to the normal 30-ish frames a second of the game, but be forewarned that they can hit in particularly intense sections on rare occasions.  The audio, likewise, can be a little inconsistent. The game was already localized for the most part, so Atlus didn't have to do much in the way of translation. This also meant that Atlus used the same voice work that people heard if they imported the game months ago, and -- as anyone who bit the bullet and bought the game early from overseas knows -- some of the conversations can be amusingly amateurish. For the most part, though, the main characters are all voiced well enough, and when they are bad, it's more chuckle-worthy than offensively bad. An anime-style dub this is not.   Believe me, you don't want to meet the business end of that dragon. But you will, don't worry. Thankfully, though, the music and effects are stellar, with the latter offering all the clangs, splinters, groans, screams and ghastly sighs one would hope for in an adventure like this. The music is arguably the most powerful source of the game's slightly depressing feel, simultaneously culling emotions like fear and depression while mixing in just the slightest bit of hope. Even the Nexus, a place that becomes a source of refuge, plays a somber, melancholy series of plucked strings endlessly. That said, it's weirdly fitting; you'll likely feel a bit more morose than in most games until you've finished off a boss, but even just the few week break I had between the import, review and final retail versions of the code made hearing those familiar strains feel almost soothing."

        "Content": "Sony's Gran Turismo may still sit in the pole position among racing sims for many, but Microsoft is making a hard charge with Forza Motorsport 3 . Developer Turn 10 has adopted a new philosophy for Forza 3: Make it accessible. The result is a hardcore simulation racing title that can also be enjoyed by the most casual of fans. The career mode is easy to get into but offers an immense challenge; you can auto-tune every car or dive into a rich set of tuning options; and driving can be toggled between a simple point-and-go system and the most physics-driven sim every created.  Simply put, Forza 3 is one of the best racers ever made.  It starts with the cars, of course. Forza 3 has more than 400 vehicles you can take for a spin and the crazy part is, they're all unlocked from the outset. That's right, with the exception of a few cars available only to those who pre-order Forza 3, every car on the disc can be driven from the get-go. Sure, you'll need to earn some credits to make your purchases, but if you can drum up a million creds, you can take the Bugatti Veyron for a spin. If you've played racing games your entire life, this fact alone may just blow your stack. It goes against everything we've ever thought about racing games. You're supposed to start with crappy cars, suffer through a few hours of slow-paced driving, then graduate to a sleeker class of vehicle. Well, Forza 3 is throwing racing conventions out the window. Hallelujah.    Even if you were stuck with the lower-end cars for the first few hours, that wouldn't be as much of an issue with Forza 3. This game is fun from the outset. Though I've played dozens of hours with Forza 3, I still go back to the E and D class cars for some races, because there are so many good cars. This is largely due to the enhanced physics of Forza 3, which add a level of nuance not experienced in most racing games.  The tire physics are so greatly improved (and include real-time deformation), that you get a true understanding of how your car is reacting at every turn. With all of the driving assists turned off, you can feel the difference from one car to the next. And though you'll race the same tracks quite often, the experience changes from one car to the next.  Forza 3 Guide A helpful breakdown of car tuning and advanced racing technique. Read the Guide \u00bb I've always felt that you couldn't properly drive a car in a racing game with the assists off if you didn't have a racing wheel. While Forza 3 controls brilliantly with a wheel, I can assure you that you can play a hundred hours with just a controller and have no issues. Turn 10 has finally mastered the subtleties of the controller, allowing for better responsiveness.  If you're a novice or just like to take things easy, Forza 3 can satisfy your racing needs as well. Turn the different assists (such as traction control) on and you can still have a good time. The cars won't feel as unique, other than the speed, but you'll have no troubles being competitive. You can even go so far as to turn on auto-braking, which allows you to hold down the gas the entire race and let the AI brake for you whenever necessary. You can't throw green turtle shells at the other drivers, but it's pretty much Mario Kart at that point.   Mess up this corner and you can rewind and try again. The great thing about Forza 3 is that it encourages even the novice to take off the training wheels and drive freely with the assists off. A rewind function allows you to instantly skip backwards in five-second intervals during a race. Misjudge your speed on a tight corner? Rewind. Get tapped from behind and spin out? Rewind. Your cat jumps on your face causing you to crash into a wall? Rewind. There's no penalty for using the rewind and no limit. Some might call this a \"win\" button, but I think the rewind is a crucial addition to Forza 3. It can become a crutch at times, but it also frees you to kick the difficulty up to a higher level and get a true appreciation for your car.  Nothing bolsters that appreciation more than the visuals. Forza 3 runs laps around its predecessor. The car models have an incredible level of detail, including unique interiors for each car. I will admit that the interiors could look a little better, but overall the car models are spectacular. There's also full damage modeling on every car. You'll see dings and dents, fender benders -- you'll even see cars flip in the air. Those with a sharp eye will catch damage decals flipping on as the car makes contact with something. When you're in the cockpit view and you tap someone with the left corner of your bumper and, like magic, paint scrape decals appear across the entire hood, it can be a little disconcerting.   Each car in Forza 3 has its own sounds, so that sitting behind the wheel of a Porsche 911 is a much different auditory experience than being in a Mustang Boss. And you'll give thanks for the roar of an engine when it drowns out the mediocre music selection.  I felt Forza 2 was lifeless and without spirit. That is not an issue with Forza 3. This is a game that showcases speed and beauty. The cars are sexy, the tracks look great, and the game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second. The lighting isn't always perfect -- you can often see shadows dancing around the car in some odd ways -- and a few times textures didn't load on the track. Despite these issues, Forza 3 is one hot looking game.  Adding some extra personality is the advanced livery editor. As a novice designer, I can't quite see what is new about the livery editor from Forza 2, but those who are experts should find it easier to make high-end art. The good news for the many of us without artistic talent is that the Monets of the Forza community can post their designs on the new online Storefront.   In the Storefront, you can purchase designs for specific cars or decals usable on any vehicle you own. Prices are set by the designers, as are the number of copies for sale. If someone wants to make a unique piece of art and sell it for 30 million credits, they can. And if someone wants to sell a limitless supply of Autobot decals on the cheap, that is also their choice. A ratings system helps create a leaderboard for designers, which you can search to find the biggest stars in the community. You can flag anyone as a favorite so you can easily browse their store for the latest designs.  Tuning is just like art design in Forza 3. Can I get a \"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Willis?\" Seriously, tuning has been transformed into an artform and has similar functionality to liveries. Great tuners can create tuning sets and sell them on the Storefront. For those used to doing their own tuning, a word of warning. It is possible (even easy) to manually upgrade and tune your car in a way that actually worsens its performance. Basic tuning is easy to do, but delve deeper and you better know a lot about cars. That also means great tuners can help you maximize your car's performance better than you could ever manage.  And if all of that is too intimidating, you always have the option to auto-upgrade before a race. These upgrades will tune and upgrade your car to fit the track and race parameters. A great tuner can do even better by manually adjusting everything, but most gamers will find the auto-tune option good enough. The point of all of this is that the hardcore have a ton of ways to bury themselves in Forza 3 and the rest of us can click a few buttons and race. After all, isn't that why you bought a racing game?  The focal point of racing is the career mode. Forza's career mode is a series of seasons, each one longer than the last. The core career lasts six seasons, though you can continue on long after that. Each season has a bi-weekly championship race. These races are set for each season and are waiting for you every other Sunday. The rest of your career is completely dynamic.   Just like the one I own in real life. For the two weeks between each championship race, you'll choose one event. Each event is broken up into a series of races. Some as few as three, others can be around a half-dozen races long. You are always given three event choices, but these change based on a number of factors: The cars you own, the car you're currently driving, and the race types you play the most. No two careers are alike. Having played deep into two different careers, I've seen firsthand how much seasons can change. Through six seasons, you'll race 55 events. There are more than 200 events in total. After powering through about 50 hours of gameplay to \"beat\" the career mode, you still have well over 150 more events to beat if you want to master Forza 3. It's insane. Because there are so many events (and a great variety at that), it's very easy to have two seasons turn out quite differently.  Completing races earns your driver experience points. For each level you're gifted a car. Free. No strings attached. The idea is to reward you for playing and encourage you to try new cars. Unlike the seasonal calendar, the car gifting is not dynamic. That means everyone who plays Forza 3 gets the same cars. You're free to buy any other cars you want (remember, nothing is locked), but certainly you will get behind the wheel of many of your gifted vehicles.   Each season gets exponentially longer. Season 2 is about twice the length of the first season and season 3 is the length of the first two put together. By the time you get to season 6, you'll be spending hours upon hours to beat each event. For me, this began to become a bit of a drag. As much as I enjoy Forza 3, I found the final season to be a real struggle to complete. What was joyous and new in the earlier seasons felt tedious by the end. Granted, many will never play long enough to reach this point and some will be thrilled at the endurance races that await, but for me, it wasn't as rewarding as the earlier seasons.  Of course, you won't be driving alone. Up to seven AI drivers will challenge you on the tracks. Forza 3 uses Turn 10's Drivatar system, which basically teaches the AI based on a player's driving style. It creates a dynamic AI that learns from you. That was in Forza 2. What is new is the AI pressure system. Get behind an AI car and, depending on the driver, they might make mistakes. You may see the AI spin-out on a turn, take a bad line, or make other noticeable errors. There are times when I play Forza 3 and forget that the AI is controlled by a computer. Often it feels like I am racing against real people, which I appreciate immensely.  The AI elements aren't perfect, however. One of Forza's biggest drawbacks is in its AI settings. There are numerous assists to alter how your car performs, but there are just three AI difficulty options: Easy, medium, and hard. Even for average drivers, medium will quickly prove too easy. But, for me, hard can be really hard at times. It leads to too many races that are either far too easy to win or seem almost impossible to compete in. If Forza 3 had one more setting between medium and hard, it would be perfect. But it doesn't and, for me, it hurts the balance over the course of the career mode.   Racing in formation? That's classy. If, while playing through a season, you long for the company of other gamers, you can give the multiplayer a shot. Turn 10 went out of its way to offer a staggering level of customization. Multiplayer may be Forza 3's crowning achievement. This is the most robust multiplayer offering ever for a sim racing game. You can customize every aspect of a race, allowing you to easily create your own game types.  You can determine if cars get a head start, which car classes can be used for a certain team, and the qualifications for winning a race. This makes it very easy to set up a great game of cat and mouse, where the mice are trying to get to the finish line and the cats are out to take them down.  You can check out my recent look at Forza 3 multiplayer if you want more details on the customization options. "

        "Content": "Is it possible for the hype of a game to completely fuel both its designers and its fans eagerly awaiting its release?  In the case of Guerrilla Games ' upcoming Killzone 2 , the answer is an emphatic yes; the developers knew that they wanted to meet or surpass the action of the now infamous E3 trailer and have been trying to perfect their anticipated shooter.  As far as fans were concerned, they were hoping that Killzone 2 would be the system seller and showcase for the PlayStation 3 -- a game that could conceivably rival that of Halo and Gears of War.  Fortunately, the wait is almost over, because Killzone 2 will be released at the end of next month.  That might seem a bit far away, but believe me when I say that the wait has been well worth it.  Killzone 2 is an outstanding evolution of the franchise, a bullet and adrenaline-fueled rampage against an implacable enemy and a fantastic shooter for the PS3.  Killzone 2 is actually the third chapter in the series, following the original PS2 shooter and Killzone: Liberation, a third-person action title on the PSP.  While players don't need to have played either one of those games to understand what's going on in Killzone 2, fans of the franchise will see connections between the three games with familiar characters popping up and events being referenced. The basic thrust of the story takes place after the events of Liberation, where the ISA has finally gotten tired of being invaded and attacked on its world of Vekta.  While the relative success of repelling the Helghast has worked, the ISA has decided to take the fight back to Emperor Visari.  Believing that the Helghast spirit has been broken by their losses on Vekta, the ISA launches a \"revenge\" invasion against the world of Helghan with the goal of capturing Visari and forcing the Helghast to stand down.  Of course, the ISA quickly discovers that this is not the case at all, and as the soldiers discover that the Helghast spirit is just as fierce on their home world than ever before, they also that discover the Helghast have new weapons to unleash on their foes.  Watch the Video Review here (HD available).  Unlike the previous games, you're not stepping into the boots of Templar, the hero of the first two titles, who's been promoted up the ranks to become a commander of a fleet and his own troops.  Instead, you'll take on the Helghast as Sev , part of a four-man team known as Alpha Squad.  Led by Rico (who players might remember from the first two games), Sev and his other teammates, Garza and Natko, fight their way across Helghan through ten separate missions that will take you about eight to ten hours to complete. Each mission you embark on has multiple checkpoints and objectives that you'll complete, and these will cover large battles, ambushes, choke points, house to house fighting and even vehicular and turret sequences.  Of all the segments, I kind of wish that the vehicles and turrets were expanded because you get a sense of truly affecting and turning the tide of the location that you're in with these weapons at your disposal.  The story of the game is pretty good for what it is.  Themes of fascism and militaristic aggression, revenge and the costs of war echo rampantly throughout the entire title.  There are a few dips here and there within the story. Rico is just as annoying and unlikable as ever; it's to the point where you can't help but hope that he meets an unsavory end in a sequel.  The ending could've also ended on a much stronger note, particularly when compared to the final battle, which can be a serious challenge of your accuracy and ability to handle threats from all sides.  When compared to that fight, the decision made at the end of the game is a poor choice -- it's obviously the weaker of two actions that could've driven the franchise forward.  However, with that being said, the majority of the plot does an excellent job of driving the action throughout the campaign, which will give you a ton of action, hellish warfare to fight and survive through, and moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.   You're not in Vekta anymore, Sev. Much of this is driven by the incredible presentation of the title, which makes you feel like you've fallen into the middle of a warzone.  Guerrilla has managed to make a technical masterpiece for the system that first-person shooters on the PS3 will be judged by from here on out. Whether it's the insanity of watching soldiers getting immolated by flamethrowers and ripped to shreds by bullets or avoiding the numerous explosions that rock your team's position, you frequently feel as though someone has you in their sights and is just getting ready to pull the trigger.  This chaotic sense is only enhanced more by the start of just about every mission, which frequently has a dramatic crash or other striking moment occur before control is given to you.  For example, when you crash land in the first level, you're almost given a burst of adrenaline because you've just managed to avoid bodies and the wreckage of a fellow lander that went flying past you.  Leaping off that and into the fray really gives you a sense of how short the life expectancy of any soldier in this war is and draws you into the fight in a way that few cutscenes could do.   Of course, there's much more to the visual sense of the game than simply the presentation of the battlefield.  Particle effects are rather striking, primarily when an RPG shell goes off and kicks dirt and dust into the air, obscuring your vision for a second as the detritus showers to the ground.  Items that are set on fire, like tapestries and other cloth will burn and turn into ash, with wisps of fabric blowing in the wind.  Many of the detailed environments, which range from the corrugated siding walls and balconies of Helghast cities to the stone supports of buildings and service areas, are destructible, allowing you to feel the impact of a firefight.  The shattered pillars, splintered boxes and other rubble that can dominate a room is a nice touch to the amount of havoc you and the enemy will wreak. The lighting effects within Killzone 2 are incredible, primarily because everything from a Helghast's illuminated eyes to the lights on a soldier's uniform casts some amount of light. The kinetic movements that you get from Helghast troops as you shoot one ensures that each death will be unique and wildly varied based on what you used to eliminate that soldier. The rattle of guns, the screams of the dying, the echo of explosions that are all perfectly done within 7.1 sound, and a soundtrack that's great; it is touches like these that add up to an eye-catching sense of realism, particularly as you move through each location and take out the dozens of Helghast that await you.  Even more creative is the use of the motion sensitivity, which doesn't feel gimmicky in the context of the game actions.  Guerrilla obviously spent time thinking about how to best use Sony's motion features, and it shows when it comes down to sequences like turning valves so that your troops can get through gates or setting explosives by tilting the controller to light the fuses on a charge before pulling out the remote detonator.  However, perhaps the most astute use is with the sniper rifle, which asks you to hold the controller steady to increase the accuracy of the shot instead of pressing a button to hold your breath.  What's great about this is that it also takes into account the action that's going on around you instead of making you immune to the explosions or external pressure, so if a grenade goes off close to you, the concussive blast (and resulting shockwave) will throw off your shot regardless of how little movement you had with the gun.  This gives a larger sense of immersion as you're playing the game, and makes it much more challenging to pick off enemies with a string of headshots.   'Scuse me while I shoot this guy. That being said, there are still some technical issues that crop up here and there.  There are a number of low resolution shadows that pop up on environments and character models, particularly when they're talking, which can detract from the action that's going on.  The same can be said for the texture pop-in that will snap into view, frequently on camera pans of a location.  Add to this some of the aliasing and even the grain filters, which give the game depth but are also a double-edged sword because it almost feels like they're overused in some areas.  It also is strange to see that for all of the visual attention paid to just about every aspect of the world, there are two elements that you see frequently that look atrocious.  The resuscitation beam that you use to revive teammates that have taken too much damage looks horrible \u2013 it's almost as if you're projecting an EKG into your friend.  Similarly, for as great as the fire looks, the stream of goo that comes out of the flamethrowers in the game looks fugly and fake; it's not nearly as bad looking once it hits a surface.  There are also some minor technical things that pop up that are much more of an inconvenience than a true gripe.  For one thing, Guerrilla made the decision to avoid an install and run everything off the disc.  While it's a laudable decision, it's also a strange one; every now and then, you'll get little hitches in play that last a few seconds while the game loads up the next section.  It's not a horrendous load by any stretch of the imagination (perhaps a second or two at the longest), but the little hiccups do stand out across the span of the game.  Similarly, the voice acting is, for the most part, pretty bad.  While Brian Cox does an excellent Emperor Visari and Radec projects menace as the Emperor's lapdog, the rest of the dialogue that's delivered feels somewhat forced.  Part of it could be the overabundant use of profanity that just feels as though it was thrown in as filler instead of being delivered naturally.  In many ways, some of the more profane lines almost feel as though a group of kids that are just experimenting with cursing are reciting dialogue.   Not a group you want to run into in a dark alley. While the story is a solo campaign, you get the sense that there is a distinct co-op feeling to it, because you are almost always partnered with one or more soldiers as you run through the various environments.  Frequently, you'll find that these guys will wind up helping you accomplish your tasks such as lifting you to the tops of walls or hacking doors so that you can proceed to different areas.  However, you'll also find that these guys are rather useful in battles and will often wind up taking out enemies that you hadn't seen or alert you to the presence of some threat.  For the most part, your allies are intelligent and will act on their own, providing cover fire when you try to flank enemies or taking their cues from you during the larger battle sequences when you and a regiment are part of a large offensive, As you push up during some fights, you'll notice that allied troops will run behind you to give support.  If you start to fall back or are repulsed by some enemies, your squad will seek cover.  However, every now and then, particularly when you're in the middle of a hallway or trying to move through a door, you'll notice that a character will block your progress, forcing you to give a rifle butt to the head to make them move out of your way.   Enemy AI is good as well \u2013 unlike the previous Killzone games, you'll discover a larger variety of Helghast soldiers, all of whom will use different tactics, that are looking to wipe you from the face of their planet. For example, assault troopers (the standard soldiers that people see in billboards or most video clips) will frequently use cover and attempt to take you out from a distance, while shock troopers will throw smoke and frag grenades as distraction tactics, switching to machine guns and eventually pulling out knives for close quarter strikes.  There are even heavy infantry, robotic drones and other hazards that you'll need to watch out for.  Because many of your battles will mix groups of Helghast together, you'll frequently need to figure out which threat you want to attack and do so quickly before you're flanked or pinned down.  This does come with a slight caveat, however, because of just how the difficulty level affects the intelligence of the soldiers.  On Recruit or Trooper (the two easier difficulty levels), soldiers will sometimes hesitate in unrealistic ways, presumably to give beginners a better chance to succeed.  However, watching some soldiers wait before charging at me or running towards a thrown grenade is incomprehensible.  On the higher difficulty levels, particularly Elite (the difficulty you unlock after beating the game once), you'll find that the AI is incredibly tough, taking little to no time to line up headshots and use their group tactics to show you absolutely no mercy. For instance, during one troop charge, I notice that three soldiers tossed grenades to force me to retreat, which was all a distraction for a fourth soldier to come up and blast me from the side. While they might still hesitate for a second or run to a grenade, these were the rare exceptions on the harder levels. If you're a shooter fan, definitely make Veteran your first step and then take on Elite for a true challenge.  You'll find that the same tactics you used on the previous difficulty levels simply won't cut it because these enemies are way too good.   Your enemies are smart enough to stay behind cover and take potshots. Success on these harder levels comes only if you master the cover system, which is truly a vital part of the gameplay.  Killzone 2 isn't a run 'n' gun kind of a shooter \u2013 if you leave yourself open, the enemies will focus their attention on you quickly and throw plenty of grenades and fire rifle bursts your way (if they're not already firing rockets at your position or turrets that is). Instead, you can use cover by pressing L2, which will allow you to attach yourself to pillars, barricades and just about any surface.  This way, you can line up a shot on an enemy or cook a grenade in safety before throwing it, ensuring that targets will be destroyed without a chance for escape.  Of course, you'll have to be careful because cover can be eliminated by enemy bullets and grenades, so you'll always have to keep an eye out for being flushed out of cover and into danger, where you'll have to rely on your wits and (hopefully) a good trigger finger to survive.  As you run through the game, you'll find that you'll be able to carry one primary weapon as well as a secondary backup pistol with unlimited ammo.  You'll have a large number of weapons to choose from to fill that primary slot, including submachine guns, rocket launchers and sniper rifles. Sev will also pack a knife and two different kinds of grenades, which he can switch back and forth between at any time.  However, players will need to get somewhat accustomed to the recoil of the primary weapon that they choose, as the climb from the recoil of firing each gun varies wildly.  Some of this is minimized by aiming and firing down the sights of the gun, but for the most part, players will learn that burst firing is more important that straight out full auto with these enemies.  That can be somewhat tricky to do, especially when a Helghast is barreling down on you and you realize that these guys can take an incredible amount of bullets and keep coming at you for more (a fact that is quickly impressed on you within the first level). However, I found that this wasn't entirely a make or break issue for me, and one that I could quickly adjust to.   Let's get ready to rumble! When you've beaten the single-player campaign once (or a couple of times if you're trying to farm trophies), there's an extensive multiplayer component waiting for you, which is an awesome experience to play through.  Not only is it incredibly deep, but there's a ton of things for newcomers and experienced veterans, which will ensure that people will play this game for many months to come.  Multiplayer is broken into two segments: Skirmish and Warzone.  Skirmish is the offline component of multiplayer, and is effectively a practice arena where you can take on up to 15 bots in multiplayer matches.  You can pick all of your criteria for your rounds and test yourself against the bots, which all react to you based on the difficulty level that you set for them (again, going off the game's four difficulty settings).  You'll also decide the match types you want to play, many of which are familiar to multiplayer veterans.  Body Count is Team Deathmatch; Search and Retrieve is essentially Capture the Flag; and Capture and Hold is a zone-based mode.   Search and Destroy tasks one team with trying to blow up a location with two explosives before time runs out, while the other side attempts to defend that target and defuse any placed explosives. Assassination marks one player for death, and that player has to avoid being killed by rivals to score.  What's great about the Skirmish mode is that it allows newcomers to get a sense of the maps that will be played within the online space, as well as the various classes and abilities granted within the multiplayer component of Killzone 2.  Veterans can also get some skill as well, testing themselves against the stronger elite bots.  While I still wish that the bots in Skirmish used their abilities or reviving beams more, it's at least refreshing to feel as though you're not going to instantly be a sitting duck.   Man down, people -- Man down! Warzone, on the other hand, is where things get interesting, and much more than the simple fact that your objectives constantly change to keep you on your toes.  Players initially start out as a soldier, who can equip a limited amount of weapons and has one grenade and very little else to sustain him.  However, just about anything that you do within a Warzone match, from placing a bomb during a Search and Destroy round to helping hold a checkpoint and destroying enemy turrets (along with killing your opponents), gives you points.  The more you play, the more points you earn, and if your side happens to win the round, you get a 1.5x multiplier for your points.  These go towards earning one of 12 ranks, which allows you to progress from a lowly private to a masterful general once you get to 2,800 points of online service. On top of these ranks, however, are additional player classes that you'll unlock, each of which carries its own kind of abilities and specialties.  There are six classes in all, ranging from medics that can revive players to Saboteurs that can disguise themselves to look like their enemies for stealth kills.  While choosing a particular class allows you to do specific things on the battlefield, if you want to unlock the true potential of that class, you're going to need to acquire ribbons and medals, which are progress-based rewards for doing specific actions.  For example, if you're a tactician, and you manage to place five spawn points in a round, you earn a ribbon.  If you earn eight of those ribbons, you then earn a Spawn point medal, which unlocks the ability to create air support robots.  This then starts you on a new ribbon/medal path, which will eventually lead you to be able to combine your skills with another class.  This means that you could essentially create a death dealing medic that places sentry turrets behind him to cover his tracks, or an Assault Saboteur that can run through enemy lines and drop proximity mines that blow up whenever an enemy nears them.  The fact that you can match so many different combinations and that it's based solely on medals will definitely keep people playing for a long time.   The real battle for Helghan starts when Multiplayer begins. The eight maps that are selected for multiplayer are really designed to amplify the amount of chaos that goes on within an online map, and considering that you can have up to 32 players in one round (which can include bots as well if you don't have enough people), the destruction can quickly ramp up.  Helping out in this respect is the inclusion of a Squad feature, which allows one player to be a squad leader for his friends.  This automatically gives all members a dedicated channel for communication of tactics. It also allows players to instantly spawn back in on the Squad Leader's position, providing instant reinforcements during a Capture and Hold round or extra soldiers during an Assassination attempt."

        "Subtitle": "Is this the definitive Rapture experience?",
        "Score": 9.4,
        "id": "53e7cf44704d2da4219d22b249e449b8",
        "Content": "Last year, 2K Games released a dark and compelling tale for Xbox 360 and PC owners that was set beneath the sea in the halls of an underwater city known as Rapture. Initially a utopian experiment for artists and scientists, the machinations of Rapture's citizens twisted the city into a nightmarish state -- one that you unfortunately find yourself trapped in.  For a while, it appeared that the first-person shooter wouldn't ever see the light of day on the PS3, but, thankfully, 2K Games took an extra year to bring the critically-acclaimed game to Sony's system.  Much more than a basic port, 2K included some exclusive extras for the PS3 as a incentive for users that have had to wait to explore Rapture's halls.  Is this the definitive \"Director's Cut\" of BioShock ?  The answer below may surprise you.  By now, many people know the premise behind BioShock, if not the entire story.  For those of you who have managed to go into a total media blackout for the past year, allow me to provide an abridged summary of the main plot points.  Set in 1960, your character is a young man who finds himself stuck in a rather precarious situation when the plane he's travelling on crashes into the ocean.  Escaping the wreckage of the plane, he manages to seek refuge in Rapture, a massive underwater city designed to free people from the relative constraints of society, religion and other restrictive organized bodies to fulfill their potential.  This vision was created by a man known as Andrew Ryan, a man whose motives were pure, but whose implementation ultimately failed horrifically.  As you move through Rapture, hoping to uncover the secrets of why the city is falling apart, you'll be forced to fight for survival against the remaining survivors.  While I could go on and on about the story and some of its themes of genetic and personal manipulation (which makes for one of the most compelling games in recent history), I'd rather point you towards Charles's review from last year, which sums up the elements of the gameplay beautifully.   Watch IGN's video review here.  For the most part, BioShock on the PS3 is exactly the same as the PC and 360 versions of the game.  However, I thought that I'd highlight some of the differences that PS3 owners will experience with this version.  First off the bat is the mandatory ten minute install process, during which you'll be treated to the old standard, \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me,\" which is a rather ironic inclusion considering all of the plasmid and genetic manipulation that runs rampant within Rapture.  The decision to acknowledge the addiction to these items by the denizens (and by extension, yourself) is quite a humorous one and worthy of note, especially if you wind up returning to replay the game over and over on various difficulty settings.  Speaking of difficulty settings, the PS3 version of BioShock receives an exclusive mode known as Survivor, whose subtitle, \"Every Bullet Counts,\" is an indication of how the game is structured -- and it's not simply a battle limitation, either.  Unlike the other three difficulty modes, Survivor radically confines the bullets and items that you receive over the course of the entire adventure, and while you can switch to another mode if it's too hard, is designed to be challenging.  If you pick up a gun, you may find only one round left in it. Plus, health items and Eve hypos don't restore as much of your meters as they would on a lower difficulty level, which forces you to ration your supplies to ensure that you can make it through battles.  This is especially true because your cash flow is just as restricted -- when you pick up money from a fallen splicer or a cracked safe, you may only get two or three dollars instead of twenty or thirty.  That means that having accuracy with every single shot is important, because you won't always be able to find extra rounds or have the money to purchase bullets at vending machines, especially if you need first aid kits to heal yourself. What's more, the splicers and other enemies that you'll face off against are tougher and much smarter than ever before.  Each one will take multiple shots from a wrench or a gun without going down, and they'll frequently seek out cover and fire behind it or hover near a first aid station to immediately heal themselves when they're in danger. Big Daddies, for instance, are truly brutal and shrug off loads of damage before they die.   She needs an old priest and a young priest...  As a result, you may find yourself using many more of the status-affecting Plasmids that have cheaper Eve costs than ever before as you try to make your way through this mode.  For instance, using Target Dummy to draw enemies into pools of water before electrifying a group of splicers, or using Enrage to force enemies to pick each other apart before you move in and mop up the remaining group is an extremely useful tactic.  However, just be aware that having this sneakier stance can potentially overcome the \"Every Bullet Counts\" limitation for the mode; by using powers like Security Bullseye and Telekinesis to save my ammunition, I was able to frequently max out my ammunition supply, as well as collect more than enough cash to purchase items throughout this difficulty mode.  It doesn't ruin the mode or the challenge posed by the splicers or Big Daddies by any stretch of the imagination, especially if you're experienced with first-person shooters, but it's a minor thing to keep in the back of your head.  However, even with this small caveat, Survivor mode highlights just how flexible and deep the Plasmid system and -- by extension -- the combat of BioShock is, because you can move through the game like a traditional shooter or approach it with a stealthier, more cautious stance.    On top of Survivor mode and full trophy support, a few adjustments have been made to some of the basic gameplay mechanics.  For one thing, the hacking mini-game, which you'll use to convert cameras, security bots and turrets over to your side to use against your enemies, is much easier to perform on the PS3.  The 360's directional pad was too imprecise to move between the circuits easily, but thanks to the DualShock's D-pad, you can fly through each box and complete your hacks quickly.  What's more, the newly downloadable plasmids that were released a few months after the game was released are included within all four difficulty levels of the game, and are easily found.  For instance, Sonic Boom, the offensive plasmid that pushes enemies backwards, is immediately accessible at the Gatherer's Garden in Fontaine's Fishery.  Even with these features included, there's one that isn't accessible at this point in time:  The PS3 version will be getting exclusive content in the form of downloadable Challenge Rooms, which will present the realm of Rapture in a completely new way, with puzzles, situations and other instances that players will be able to solve.  Essentially side stories or alternate history brainteasers, the Challenge Rooms could potentially extend the life of the game substantially.  However, none of these rooms are currently available and probably won't be available at launch; we haven't heard anything about when they'll be accessible of if you'll need to pay for them either.  As a result, this feature is essentially useless until they're finally released at some point in the future. I wish that I had a chance to check these out beforehand.  While it's not something that ruins the BioShock experience by any means, PS3 owners should be aware that they won't be able to fully experience all of the content for a while.   Bugs Bunny took Halloween a bit too far this year.  However, what does detract from the gameplay is the fact that there are a number of technical issues that should have been ironed out in the extra year of development time that the PS3 version has had.  For one thing, the slowdown that cropped up in the 360 version of the game is still present within the PS3 version, and is inexcusable in just how frequent it occurs. It's strange when you're facing off against one particular splicer and the game's framerate stutters, but when you get into an area with a Big Daddy and a few Nitro Splicers, the slowdown can hitch the game for three or more seconds thanks to the explosions and actions of each creature.  That's just horrible, and should've been fixed instead of ported over.  Similarly, object detection issues remain, as you'll find Pep Bars, bags of chips and other items sticking through desks and into drawers, or halfway in and out of crates or other containers. Even stranger is the fact that you'll find some firearms dropped from killed enemies that you can plainly see but not pick up the guns to collect their bullets. While the amount of bodies that twitch after an enemy has been killed has been dramatically reduced, you'll still run into a couple of enemies that will vibrate and shake with post-mortem seizures.  What's more, the Little Sister glitch returns with the PS3 version.  This isn't nearly as bad as the other problems that I just mentioned, particularly because you can gain extra Adam to purchase extra plasmids in the game, but it does stand out as a glitch nestled in a load of technical problems from last year's experience.  Were this to be considered the definitive BioShock experience, you'd think that many of these bugs would've been fixed, or at least explainable as to why they're still in the game.  As they currently exist, they seem to be more like a carryover from a bad port of the title.   An Ice facial will definitely clear up that skin condition.  This can also be said about some of the visuals within the game, which have received a number of enhancements, but also suffer from older, less impressive texture work.  2K Games went out of their way to make sure that the larger capacity of the Blu-ray was used to implement higher resolution textures across the title, as well as improve some of the in-game cutscenes.  For the most part, you'll see these appear as a slightly sharper Rapture across the board, and you'll be able to pick up some features that look better than on the 360, such as pools of water or neon signage.  However, there does appear to be a strange mix of the older textures scattered in the title as well, so you'll find quite a lot of texture pop in that will occur as you move through levels.  This isn't solely as you load up a new level; this can occur even as you move through a section.  It doesn't ruin the game's beauty in the slightest, but it does stick out like a sore thumb at times."

        "Title": "Crysis Warhead Review",
        "Subtitle": "Once more unto the island, dear friends, once more.",

        "id": "91543775db7000ac50d5991d21922a3c",
        "Content": "Crysis Warhead is the videogame equivalent of a summer action movie, and while it's more action-heavy than its highly acclaimed predecessor, it still retains its brains. Like Crysis, Warhead is a sandbox shooter that gives you large amounts of freedom as to how you approach each tactical situation. And there are plenty of tactical situations, because Warhead seems aimed at those who felt that Crysis was a bit too slow-paced and cerebral at times. But while it doesn't quite match the over-the-top insanity of a Call of Duty game, Warhead does prove that Crytek can deliver an intense action game.  Warhead is a companion game to Crysis, with a story that runs concurrently to that in the first game. An alien artifact has been discovered on a tropical island, and after the United States and North Korea race to seize it, an alien invasion erupts, flash freezing the island and putting the world at risk. The difference is in perspective; you now get to play as British Sergeant Michael Sykes, aka Psycho, the blowhard from the first game. Warhead takes place on \"the other side of the island\" that Crysis takes place on. If you played that game you already know the beginning and the end, so what matters here is the journey.    The opening cinematic establishes the kind of character Psycho is, and the kind of game Warhead will be. With aplomb, he leaps off of cliffs into moving trucks, manhandles North Koreans, and generally sneers at danger. Warhead is a much more cinematic game than its predecessor, partly due to third-person cutscenes (they were totally absent in Crysis), but also because it feels like Crytek openly borrowed a page or two from director Michael Bay. This goes right down to the overwrought emotional scenes to the driving musical score full of Japanese takio drums and soaring movements.  Like Crysis, the heart of Warhead is its combination of sandbox gameplay with the nanosuit, the high-tech body armor that can give you superhuman strength or speed, or cloak you from detection. Used correctly, the nanosuit lets you basically be the alien Predator from the movies, and the open nature of the levels means that you can dictate the terms of the battle. It's a blast to hurl grenades at long range at a squad of bad guys, then use speed to close the distance, strength to pick up a survivor and hurl him into his buddies, and then to finish them off with a few rounds of rifle fire. You can cloak and sneak right up to your opponents, or have them follow you only to cloak and then change direction. It's all up to you. Combine that ad lib style of gameplay with the generally smart AI, and each play-through of Warhead can be completely different.   The grenade launcher is your new best friend. Seriously. The emphasis is on large battles, whether you're assaulting a beach resort full of North Korean troops, barreling down a road in an APC and shooting up the villages you drive through, or defending a group of soldiers from alien assault. Crytek reduced the downtime between battles to a bare minimum; you're often no sooner out of a fight before stumbling into another one. And sometimes, you might even drag one fight into another. That happened quite a bit during the alien levels, when the aliens attacked me with numbers that forced me to engage in a running battle. I'd have one group chasing me only to stumble into another. And, yes, the alien battles in Warhead are a lot tougher than they are in Crysis. Gone are the short, linear sequences; now you're in the sandbox with the aliens, so it's a fast-paced cat-and-mouse game of shoot, move, and cover. The aliens dart around; they like to pelt you from a distance. There are also some new alien types, including a new shield alien that protects his buddies; you have to take him out first in a fight, which isn't easy.  You get some new toys; my favorite is the six-shot grenade launcher that provides some personal artillery, as well as a submachine gun and equipment like antitank mines. Still, for the most part, many of the weapons remain the same, though the lower difficulty levels now allow you to automatically pick up ammo by walking over it, which is more user friendly. And your most potent weapon remains your nanosuit; used smartly, you can survive just about any situation.   Bring your thermal underwear. While shorter and slightly less epic than Crysis, Warhead still provides a fun ride. Crytek definitely learned some lessons and have applied them to Warhead. I also like how Crytek has a lot more fun with the frozen paradise that the island becomes once the aliens freeze it. There are definitely some memorable scenes, like when you're piloting a hovercraft and hitting jumps off of frozen waves. Or how the brittle, iced-over jungle shatters when the bullets fly in a firefight.    Warhead is a great value considering that it retails at $29.99, or $20 less than most games. For that, you get a single-player campaign that I powered through in about five hours, but your mileage may vary. I played at the Normal difficulty setting, and there are two harder settings that will certainly require you to slow down a bit and be more careful in battle. And, of course, you can experiment with different approaches, like being completely stealthy and ninja-like. However, there's also a much-improved multiplayer suite called Crysis Wars that comes on its own disc, and it makes Warhead an even better deal.  Crysis shipped with a multiplayer mode called Power Struggle that is, in hindsight, far too complicated for its own good. It tries to emulate a Battlefield-style experience, but is crippled by a mess of confusing rules and moving parts. As a result, Crysis never built up much of a multiplayer community. Crysis Wars makes things better and more fun by introducing a slew of new maps geared toward good ol' fashioned team deathmatch gameplay, but with the added bonus of everyone having nanosuits. The same kind of dynamic abilities that you have in single-player can be used in multiplayer to great extent. Have to expose yourself while climbing up a long ladder? Cloak and don't let an enemy sniper have a free shot at you. Run out of bullets? Go to strength mode and try and get in a punch. Or speed lets you dart between cover before the enemy can draw a bead on you.   These things get horrible mileage. The Crysis Wars levels that I played were beautiful and varied, from a vertical assault on a mountain peak in the harsh morning light to a foggy battle in a graveyard. While most of the maps that we saw were infantry-only, there was one vehicle map that was a blast, with plenty of tanks and APCs and helicopters to play with, but also enough anti-vehicle weaponry that infantry can also play a crucial role. Hopefully Crytek delivers on the promise to add new content to Crysis Wars over time, because only one vehicle map is definitely not enough. About the only thing missing from multiplayer but found in a lot of new games is some kind of persistent stat tracking. It'd be nice if you could keep track of your kill/death ratio, your success with various weapons, and if you take the idea further, introduce medals and unlocks to reward long-term play.  Finally, we get to the part of the review everyone wants to know about: performance. Crytek claims that Warhead is better optimized than Crysis, and everything I experienced confirms this. In fact, what's amazing is that Warhead not only runs better than Crysis, it looks better than Crysis. Keep in mind, a year has passed since Crysis shipped and there still isn't a non-Crytek game that approaches it in terms of visuals. Warhead features more definition to the terrain, and the lighting and particle effects have gotten big boosts. I found myself walking through jungle with the morning light piercing the canopy and had to stop and just absorb the moment. It had a level of atmosphere that I can't recall from the first game.   The dark clouds portend trouble. And so does the freeze beam. I played Warhead on a high-end machine with a quad core CPU and the latest Nvidia graphics card at high resolution (1680x1050) with all the details set to Enthusiast, which is essentially very high. It looked cutting edge and the frame rate was solid. Next, I checked the game on a slightly older PC with a two-year old 8800GTS and I was still able to crank it to Enthusiast settings and the same resolution and get solid results. Finally, I checked it out on the \"$700 PC\" that Crytek and EA have been touting. It really is a $700 machine built on the latest mainstream parts (the video card is a 9800GT), and I was able to play the final boss battle at the same resolution and at Enthusiast settings and get solid frame rates. I also tried it the Gamer setting, which is essentially high, and the frame rate was buttery smooth. You do lose some visual quality stepping down from Enthusiast, but even at Gamer Warhead still looks better than almost every game out there.  Multiplayer is a blast, finally. "

        "Content": "A turn-based grand strategy game on the scale of Total War: Three Kingdoms often struggles to present a consistent and meaningful challenge across hundreds of turns and dozens of battles. With this foray into ancient China, however, Creative Assembly seems to have finally hit an elusive sweet spot with its campaign tuning. A political and tactical landscape that\u2019s almost never boring, filled out with gorgeous, stylized graphics, an excellent character system, and massive performance improvements over previous games in the series leave no doubt who the new emperor is around these parts. Three Kingdoms offers you two ways to conquer its sprawling, attractively exaggerated map of 200s CE China. Records mode is closer to classic historical Total War, where generals are mere mortals accompanied into battle by a bodyguard regiment, and real-time engagements play out slowly and less decisively. It also led me to feel like I might as well be playing any other historical Total War game, though. That\u2019s not a deal-breaker given how many other things are fresh and exciting on the campaign map, but I was never all that tempted to give it much of my time when the other option is so much cooler. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The campaign really comes alive in Romance mode, which is based on the semi-historical novel about the era, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This turns your generals into demigod-like kung fu action heroes who engage in dramatic duels and can take on hundreds of normal soldiers single-handedly. Both modes put a strong emphasis on the larger-than-life characters driving the action, including quippy banter both before and during battle that helps bring them to life. But some of the fun and character is definitely lost if you\u2019re sticking closer to the history books in Records mode. The campaign really comes alive in Romance mode.Spotlighting named characters helps make up for the fact that the armies themselves aren\u2019t quite as diverse or interesting as, say, the Warhammer Total Wars\u2019 or even Thrones of Britannia\u2019s. We\u2019re back in the land of swordsmen, spearmen, archers, and cavalry in various configurations maneuvering to best exploit the rock-paper-scissors relationships between different troops. And there aren\u2019t competing ethnic groups to shake things up on the level of Huns vs Romans in Attila since all the action takes place between factions that are decidedly Chinese. Diversity in army composition is encouraged in other ways, however, as troops are recruited to a specific character\u2019s retinue and armies are made up of one to three of them. Also, each general has a class, so you\u2019ll want to compose forces around complementary generals with regiments that take the best advantage of their bonuses. Holding Out For a Hero Total War: Three Kingdoms adds a clever layer of personality and tactical consideration with its five hero classes. Since you can only include three heroes in any army, you won\u2019t have access to every possible utility in any given one. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re each good at: Vanguard: Breaking enemy lines. These heroes are the best against normal, everyday troops and have a strong offensive focus. They can also recruit higher-tier shock cavalry and give combat bonuses to shock cavalry. You want to throw them at the weakest part of the enemy line and watch the sparks fly. Champion: Dueling. These are the heroes that kill other heroes. They\u2019re not as good in a chaotic melee as Vanguards, but are peerless in one-on-one combat. They also allow you to recruit higher-tier spearmen and give combat bonuses to spearmen. You want to sick them on the enemy\u2019s most important generals right away. Sentinel: Hold the line! These guys can plant their feet and take a charge, outlasting any other hero type in a protracted brawl. They unlock high-tier swordsman for recruitment and give combat bonuses to all swordsmen. You want to set them up in a spot where you need the line to hold, come hell or Lu Bu. Commander: Inspiration. No one can rally the troops better than a commander. In addition, they unlock some of the best melee cavalry available and give combat bonuses to melee cavalry. Use their mobility to move them around the field and provide encouragement to any regiments you may see on the verge of fleeing. Strategist: The right push at the right time. The combat buffs available to these heroes are usually very situational, but very powerful if deployed for maximum effect. They\u2019ll also bring the best archers to the field and pair particularly well with any unit wielding ranged weaponry. Use them wisely and they may be the point on which the whole battle turns. Each faction also gets a set of unique mechanics and some even feature a unique currency. The best of these, of the warlords I played, is the scheming Cao Cao who can spend his unique Credibility resource to improve or worsen relations between any two factions. If you get them to hate each other enough you can even instigate a proxy war to soften them up for when you eventually swoop in to devour both their battered corpses, or force someone you\u2019re already fighting to divert resources elsewhere. label=Why%20Can't%20We%20Be%20Friends%3F Staffing your armies isn\u2019t always just a matter of picking the statistically best officer for the job because characters can develop friendships and rivalries over time, which adds an interesting wrinkle into organizing your forces. Two hotshot generals who hate each other might resent being placed in the same army, just as those who are fighting beside their sworn brothers will perform better. And that\u2019s before you even get into deeper political considerations, like the all-star Champion you just hired deciding he wants a more prestigious political office and threatening to abandon your faction if you don\u2019t give it to him. I\u2019M LOOKING AT YOU, LU BU! Far better than any previous Total War game, Three Kingdoms lays on diplomatic and military pressure early.Whoever ends up leading your armies, they\u2019re in for quite a challenge. Far better than any previous Total War game, Three Kingdoms lays on diplomatic and military pressure early and somehow manages to maintain it even many dozens of turns into a successful campaign. The open geography of China is at least partly to thank for this, but the aggressiveness of the AI and the way armies are trained and deployed play a role as well. I\u2019ve always been bored to tears by that traditional late game Total War slog of sending a few godlike stacks of elite troops around the map to mop up all resistance with auto-resolve battle after auto-resolve battle. But even on the default difficulty, Three Kingdoms offered me tense, fairly balanced, exciting battles throughout. The one drawback is that it got a little bit exhausting after a certain point. It\u2019s a great change overall, but it might have swung things just a tad too far in the other direction now. I wouldn\u2019t mind being able to effortlessly crush a stubborn enemy on their last legs every once in a while, just as a reward for fighting my heart out for so long. label=There%20Can%20Be%20Only%20Three One of the cleverest ways the campaign maintains this pressure is by having all of the minor warlords coalesce into the titular Three Kingdoms in the late game. Once you become powerful enough to stake a claim on the Imperial throne, your two most dangerous remaining rivals will do the same and morph the field from a chaotic free-for-all to a three-way Mexican standoff from which only one ruler can emerge victorious. It provides the same great escalation in tension as the Realm Divide mechanic from Total War Shogun 2, but without arbitrarily handing half of your hard-won provinces to rebels. Every IGN Total War Review Ever 20 Images Not all of the new campaign mechanics are so flashy and impactful, though. There\u2019s a whole system of ministries, governorships, and assignments you can slot characters into that grant bonuses to your faction, but I found that I mostly forgot they existed most of the time. Their greatest benefit seems to come from giving a discontented character a fancy title so they don\u2019t ragequit and go join another warlord. The bonuses are nice, but most of them come simply from having any given butt in the right chair. Bonuses from individual characters\u2019 butts are relatively meager and ignorable. Assignments in particular, which are meant to give your characters who aren\u2019t actively governing or leading an army something to do, could have completely disappeared and I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed. There\u2019s no notification for when assignment slots are available, so unless I made a point of checking their menu every turn I really only used them if there was a crisis, like a food shortage, and I needed a way to shore it up quickly. Three Kingdoms runs like an absolute dream.The gold dragon ornament on top of all of this is that Three Kingdoms runs like an absolute dream. Every Total War game since 2013\u2019s Rome 2 has had significant performance issues, even on high-end hardware. But much to my surprise, both the campaign map and the battles glided along like a crane on the wind without even making my GeForce GTX 1070 and i7-4770K break a sweat \u2013 even on Ultra settings. As a baseline, I was getting almost 50% higher framerates on the battle map than the recent Thrones of Britannia. I still saw some slowdowns in absolutely titanic clashes involving multiple full-sized armies beefing apocalyptically over a massive, fortified city, but not to the same degree that I\u2019m used to with this series."

        "Content": "Guacamelee 2 often had me laughing out loud. And just as often, it had me gripping my controller and gritting my teeth, trying not to be too frustrated with myself as I learned the luchador skills needed to nail its most difficult platforming puzzles. But no matter what emotion it evoked, I loved nearly every minute of Drinkbox Studios\u2019 fantastic follow-up, which offers a smart evolution of its revered predecessor that only briefly feels overly familiar. Picking up with a helpful reminder of how Guacamelee ended (which I needed, because it was first released way back in 2013) the sequel returns with plenty of humor and a surprising but welcome bit of pathos at the start of its eight-hour adventure. I was surprised at how affected I was to see Juan enjoy a peaceful life at home with his wife, two kids, and a diet that has caused his fighting physique to be lost to time, only for his happiness \u2014 in every possible timeline imaginable \u2014 to be disrupted by a new evil, Salvador. Yes, Guacamelee 2 tackles the well-worn trope of multiple timelines converging and endangering all of existence, but approaches it through the clever lens of the Mexiverse. I initially groaned a bit at that name, but Guacamelee 2 is not content to let an amusing portmanteau be the extent of its joke. The central conceit of the sequel works so well because Drinkbox wholeheartedly tackles the idea of multiple timelines, playing into established characters from the first entry while also finding clever new ways to use those to twist the gameplay, like temporarily transforming the adventure into a simple, but amusing turn-based RPG. It feels like a natural extension of the dimension shifting introduced in the original, with both character and gameplay implications that often had me chuckling in between sections of challenging platforming. Guacamelee 2 actually gives its referential humor substance this time around. \u201c And Guacamelee 2 is consistently clever and funny. The original\u2019s humor is plentiful, but relies a little too much on tossing out as much referential humor as possible rather than making those references actually funny. Meme overload was a problem, and Drinkbox clearly recognized that and addressed it by adding depth to the gags. Posters referencing pop culture still populate Juan\u2019s Mexico, but they\u2019re more evergreen and less focused on squeezing a hammy joke onto a signboard. Instead, the referential humor comes in the form of gameplay interludes referencing classic and indie gaming hits ranging from The Unfinished Swan to even Guacamelee itself. It would be a shame to ruin them for you, but rest assured nearly every one of them had me laughing along to their clever twists. Those subversions often include a one-off gameplay hook that, while often played for laughs, inject some nice variety and are always worth seeing through to the end. 41 Images Guacamelee 2 does a great job of balancing all of this referential world-building with the beautiful, brightly colored style of the Mexiverse. I often found myself spending extra time in certain areas, flipping back and forth between the two realms just to experience the art styles of both the worlds of the living and the dead. From temples to the underworld to quiet pueblos pocketed by timeline-melding distortions, I adored watching the vibrancy of Juan\u2019s world pop with earthy browns and forested greens in the land of the living and bright blues and shocking streaks of pink in the land of the dead. Drinkbox finds clever ways of playing with Juan and other characters. \u201c And my investment in it only became greater thanks to some smart story choices. Drinkbox finds clever ways of playing with Juan, his cantankerous mentor Uay Chivo, and other established characters \u2013 so much so that I came away surprised by how much I gave a damn about what happened to Juan when he was pulled away from his own home timeline. The story does miss a step in its exploration of the villain, Salvador, though. He\u2019s initially set up to be a fascinating foil to Juan, but he only has a few paltry scenes in which to develop, including one incredibly exposition-heavy sequence that could have had so much more impact had Salvador and Juan interacted more often. That scene in particular sets up what should be a sympathetic character, only to end up feeling more forced than earned.  Mucha Lucha Thankfully, the adventure is filled with a host of challenging and satisfying platforming and combat, all culled from Juan\u2019s fighting style. It takes a little longer than I would have liked to reacquire his returning powers, which include suped-up headbutts, ground pounds, a reality-shifting ability, and more, but Drinkbox does a great job of peppering in a few new hooks alongside all of those moves. Guacamelee 2's platforming can be complex, but it never feels unfair. \u201c And I mean literal hooks \u2014 Juan can latch onto and launch from any number of eagle-shaped hooks strategically floating throughout the world. They add a new dimension to platforming, which, especially as the adventure goes on, can require some devilishly difficult timing. Jumping, punching, hook jumping, and dimension shifting all have to be strategically deployed to progress. Thankfully, the added complexity does not come at the cost of a sense of achievability. It\u2019s often tricky, but Guacamelee 2 always feels fair in its construction, and is reasonably forgiving thanks to frequent checkpoint saves. A missed platform or a death at the hands of a room full of foes always came down to my timing, never the way levels or combat scenarios were crafted. A series of skill trees do a nice job of forcing you to use the full gamut of Juan\u2019s moves in combat, but I would have liked to have seen more variance in Juan\u2019s human moveset. Because so much of it is carried over from the first game, it begins to feel like more of the same as the adventure wears on. The biggest mechanical additions are for Juan\u2019s chicken form, including an aerial dash, which can hilariously be used to ping-pong a chicken up or down a corridor. A subplot revolving around the chickens of Guacamelee offers a hilarious explanation, and while it\u2019s less essential to see that all the way through I absolutely recommend doing so. While it\u2019s a joy to explore Guacamelee 2 thanks to the clever writing snuck into every corner of the map, it\u2019s also a rewarding thrill to complete its platforming puzzles, which can be quite the challenge, but by no means impossible. More than once, rooms that had me dimension shifting to jump between walls while avoiding lava below and spikey gears working their way around the room tripped me up enough to require a few breaks and episodes of Steven Universe to clear my mind. The road to 100% offers several more hours of challenging, rewarding content. \u201c For those who want a bit more punishment, the road to 100% easily offers that with three or so more hours of optional content\u2026 depending on how often you die, of course. I easily died over a dozen times at each of the most difficult platforming challenges, including a few that required me to hit multiple eagle hooks while dimension shifting to activate them all, only to then turn into a chicken to float above spike beds, and then hop back to Juan\u2019s human form for more eagle hooks without missing a beat. But the work was worth it \u2014 not just for the extra treasure but for the pure satisfaction of overcoming its smartly designed obstacle courses, which forced me to master every one of Juan\u2019s skills in combination with one another. That always felt achievable thanks to how gradually it layers on new mechanics, which inform both the fighting and platforming simultaneously.  Tag Team Whether you\u2019re overcoming a difficult jump or a hallway full of undead foes, up to three friends can lend you assistance if needed. I played a couple hours with a co-op buddy, and the presence of another player can turn into a difficult, synchronized ballet of flying fists and leaping luchadors. Figuring out how to properly hop, dimension shift, and punch our way through together made me think about Guacamelee 2\u2019s puzzles in a new, fascinating way \u2014 he could handle dimension duties while I timed by jumps to his shifting, for example. That said, not all of these challenges are well-suited to multiple luchadors. Some of the most difficult parts demand perfect unity, and that\u2026 well, that\u2019s really hard to achieve in the later and optional challenges. It simply became easier to let my friend die as I coasted through a difficult corridor rather than spend so much time nailing down timing on a relatively easy obstacle. It\u2019s nice to have, but doesn\u2019t add anything significant to the satisfaction of toughing out Guacamelee 2\u2019s challenges alone."

Unfortunately, servers are still struggling, which means your mileage may vary day-to-day when it comes to online features. But the silver lining is the mostly formidable AI can make even offline matches interesting and tense. The execution of this simple idea is so strong and so engaging that it keeps bringing me back, time and time again, for just one more match.\u201d ( Read the archived original Rocket League review .) Now, nearly three years later and with all the additional updates, features, and new platforms (including the newly launched Nintendo Switch version), Psyonix\u2019s insane formula of rocket-powered cars playing sports has only gotten better with age. The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn\u2019t changed a bit. The rules are simple: two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy, brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. A game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. \u201c But there\u2019s a golden layer of strategy and mechanical depth tucked inside the chaotic mashing of metal. Timing a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick to connect with the ball and send it sailing at a precise angle takes notable skill. Those basics, when coupled with expert teamplay and mind-blowing booster-powered aerial maneuvers, solidify Rocket League as a game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. At launch, the content around that gameplay felt a little barebones. Since then, though, it\u2019s been substantially fleshed out with smart alternate modes that emphasize different skills and add variety. The Snow Day hockey mode substitutes a dense, oversized puck for the bouncier soccer ball; Hoops is a basketball variant emphasizing aerial play; Dropshot is a two-sided floor-breaking mode; and Rumble mode deals out power-ups that disrupt players and influence the ball. It\u2019s all a ton of fun. And of course, the competitive playlist for the traditional 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 shines as the great ladder system Rocket League was missing to bring some-term goals to its pick-up-and-play ease, offering seasonal cosmetic rewards and bragging rights as you try to climb through the ranked tiers. Decisions, Decisions Overall, Rocket League remains a balanced multiplayer playing field. While the mechanical differences between the free cars and the large assortment of paid-for downloadable cars are noticeable, they\u2019re barely relevant. Sure, some cars turn slightly faster, some have better hitboxes for flipping, but these small differences only really matter at the highest levels of competition, where a few modest purchases don\u2019t seem like too much to ask. The cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. \u201c Serious players have their go-to speedsters, but even with the continuous influx of brand-associated cars you can purchase and use, you\u2019re still totally effective on the field. That\u2019s a list that includes the Batmobile, a DeLorean, and the platform-exclusive cars like the Mario/Luigi-mobile, Halo's Warthog, or Sweet Tooth's ice cream truck. Meanwhile, the cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. With everything from customizable goal explosions to player banners, there are innumerable combinations that allow you to truly stand out, and almost all of it can be earned just by playing. There\u2019s some grinding, sure, but you\u2019re always rewarded, and even duplicate items can be stacked up and traded in for items of better quality using a rudimentary crafting system that adds another layer to the appeal of collecting cosmetics. And yes, Rocket League does come with loot crates that you earn for playing online matches (roughly one every 10 hours of play), but here they\u2019re used relatively inoffensively and can be completely toggled off in the options menu when setting up a game. You can't purchase them with real money, so there's no real pay-to-win element \u2013 especially since these items don't actually do anything other than make you look rad. Instead, they're more like optional rewards you get for grinding out online matches that you can open if you decide to spend $1.50 for a key (or $1 each if you buy in bulk). If you don\u2019t want to spend money at all, you can still get at the contents of these boxes by participating in special, limited-time events that award you keys just for playing more Rocket League. Your Platform Mileage May Vary The sheen on Rocket League\u2019s sleek, neon-coated look varies by platform. On everything but Switch, it runs from the standard 1080p all the way up to 4K on PS4 Pro and PC right now. (4K and HDR support is confirmed to be coming soon to Xbox One X.) Visually, you can\u2019t really go wrong with any version, since Psyonix has made efforts to ensure that you\u2019re always getting 60 frames per second in one- and two-player local splitscreen game modes on most maps. But maintaining that frame rate comes at a price on the Switch, which runs a resolution of around 526p in handheld, and 720p while docked. Blown up on a decently sized TV, you can easily see a lot of rough, jagged lines and edges, both during matches and even in menus, and missing visual effects in arenas. That said, in handheld mode it\u2019s incredibly cool to be able to play Rocket League no matter where you are in a portable enough form that beats the hell out of carrying a laptop and a controller around. But the small screen in portable mode makes it difficult to be as precise, and I regularly found I had a harder time nailing those precise angles that become second nature over time. And that becomes much worse when trying to play local split-screen on the Switch in tabletop mode - half of a small screen is almost comical. While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go \u2013 which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode \u2013 the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent on all platforms."

        "Content": "There\u2019s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I\u2019d finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later. Horizon\u2019s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. \u201c A sense of urgency is established from the get-go, as Horizon\u2019s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. The questions raised by protagonist Aloy and the primitive, feral machine-infested open world she inhabits kept me guessing throughout: what\u2019s at the centre of it all? Although Horizon suffers from occasionally corny dialogue that belies its smarts, the broader ideas it prods at - the nature of creation, for example - are remarkably ambitious. Aloy\u2019s personality helped me care about her journey on a more personal level. Nimbly voiced by Ashly Burch (known for her performance as Borderlands 2\u2019s Tiny Tina), she\u2019s a charming character to watch and play as because of the wry wit that tempers her big-hearted heroism; some of my favourite smaller moments came from Aloy\u2019s sarcastic interactions with other characters who didn\u2019t get the joke. Though you have some say on the way she responds to situations in the interests of dialogue flavour, she remains largely a well-intentioned character, which is in step with Horizon\u2019s broader story. Fighting Machines  There\u2019s much more flexibility to be found once Aloy\u2019s out in the big wide world. Horizon\u2019s combat is its most compelling feature, thanks to the variety found within 26 distinct species of animal-like machines that roam its great far-future expanse. These beasts have several weak points that can be scanned using Aloy\u2019s Focus (a lore-friendly device that gives you Witcher-like heightened senses), and hitting different points can have different results that change the way a fight plays out. Horizon's combat is its most compelling feature. \u201c  Send a piercing arrow into the bulging \u2018cargo sac\u2019 of a giant fire-spewing Bellowback, for example, and you'll set off a massive explosion. Down a flying, ice-shooting Glinthawk by destroying the armoured sac on its chest to temporarily freeze the bird, or shoot the cannon off the back of a tiger-like Ravager and pick it up to blast a T-Rex-esque Thunderjaw, who you only just noticed approaching from the corner of your eye during the fight. It\u2019s breathless stuff, and there are no hand-holding tutorials telling you how to best approach the beasts, which makes for more rewarding wins. After I learned how to fight competently, Horizon continually made me feel like a ridiculously accomplished warrior without sacrificing the vital sense that every major battle could easily result in my death, in large part thanks to the ferocity of the machines themselves. Though they patrol on set routes, even the 'herbivores' will immediately attack when you\u2019re spotted, and will continue to scan for you if you manage to find a hiding place. On the offense, these robotic beasts are authentically animalistic. Snapmaws \u2013 enormous, mechanical alligators \u2013 will swipe with their tails and spew ice blasts from their mouths, while tiger-like Ravagers will charge at you with alarming speed for a full body slam up close. Dodging their attacks requires constant use of Aloy\u2019s roll move, all the while using the quick on-the-fly crafting system to build ammo specifically to counter the threat. Her upgradable bows feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time. \u201c For Aloy\u2019s part, her arsenal is largely tricked-out \u2018primitive\u2019 weaponry. Her upgradable bows and elemental-infused arrows - your primary weapon - feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time, allowing for dead-eye aiming. She also has access to a handful of more elaborate devices like the Ropecaster, which shoots out ropes to immobilize enemies, or the Tripcaster, a weapon that creates explosive tripwire traps at a range. Though these more creative weapons sound great in theory, in practice they\u2019re annoyingly slow and fiddly when you're up against multiple threats, and I found the most challenging machines were too fast and too powerful to use them in a genuinely effective way. Fun to play around with on weaker enemies during more casual hunts, then, but far from crucial when you're up against a wall. Not that Horizon encourages you just to blindly wander into every fight and start shooting. A lot of the machines roam in packs, with larger beasts flanked by velociraptor-like sentry bots called Watchers, so if you\u2019re not careful you can be outnumbered and devoured within seconds. To counter this, there\u2019s generally a silent path to take: hiding in swatches of tall red grass and drawing machines in gives you a chance for a stealth kill, and if by some misfortune you\u2019re spotted, Aloy\u2019s Concentration skill is vital in helping you land an arrow right in that Watcher\u2019s prying eye before you make a quick escape. It\u2019s a shame luring specific machines away from their packs is so time-consuming, though; often simple hunts for a single animal evolve into massive fights against several types. Alternatively, Aloy doesn\u2019t have to do all the work herself, as she\u2019ll discover how to override the machines\u2019 brains in the field while exploring her world (to tell you how would ruin a wonderful surprise). Overriding has different effects depending on the machine - some become docile mounts, for example, while others will fight on your behalf, killing their own kind. As you upgrade your skill tree, these overrides can last for longer, which allows you to essentially build up a small army of loyal, vicious steeds. Watching them wreak havoc on the field from a place of safety is smugly satisfying. The Big, Big Wide World You don\u2019t just fight machines in Horizon. While not as engaging as their mechanical counterparts, there are human targets too - many of whom populate the bandit camps peppered throughout this massive open world. Though you\u2019re free to take them on as you please, I found it\u2019s best to take a stealthy approach through the tall grass and pick off these heavily armed NPCs one by one. That\u2019s a largely satisfying approach, aside from the fact that, like in other half-stealth games like Uncharted 4 or Watch Dogs 2, you can\u2019t hide bodies. It\u2019s a design decision that sticks in my craw when an NPC\u2019s curiosity piques after he or she spots someone sprawled on the ground with an arrow sticking out of its chest from a mile away. Clearing these enemy camps is one of the many incidental side activities scattered across Horizon, a variety which also includes digging in ancient bunkers for clues from the past, tracking machines through dedicated hunting grounds, and climbing to the top of a giant brontosaurus-like Tallneck to unlock more of the map. It\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t seen before in other games of this ilk - the Tallneck is basically a walking Far Cry tower - but thanks to the promise of XP and loot that you can trade for currency to buy better weapons, it\u2019s all very compulsive. Horizon's \u2018post-post apocalyptic\u2019 landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying. \u201c On top of that, Horizon's \u2018post-post apocalyptic\u2019 landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying, so journeying through it in search of things to do between main quests - not that you ever have to go too far - is usually a reward of its own. Snowy vistas, autumnal forests, and vast deserts are stunningly realised, even capped at 30 frames per second as it is. (That\u2019s true on PlayStation 4 Pro as well, where it runs in a stunning 4K mode.) Frozen mountain peaks or the calcified remains of a skyscraper make for eerie, quiet jaunts, made more unnerving by the Lost World-esque horror that sits in Horizon's underbelly. One of the most thrilling moments in my playthrough was when I got lost early on, skirted too close to the water\u2019s edge, and accidentally walked across the giant tail of a half-submerged Snapmaw before sprinting to safety with sweaty palms. Being killed in Horizon isn\u2019t Dark Souls-style punishing, but as you save via spread out \u2018campfires\u2019, the threat of death also equals the threat of losing some progress. It\u2019s enough to make these moments of terrifying discovery into Horizon\u2019s \u2018water cooler moments\u2019 \u2013 the ones you look back on and shiver. Aloy moves about the world with near Uncharted-like ease, too. Developer Guerrilla have done a great job at making her base movements - such as climbing, rolling, rappelling down cliff faces - fluid and responsive. Though I noticed the occasional pop-in and judder, Horizon\u2019s visuals keep up with Aloy, and impressively, I didn\u2019t notice any significant glitches in its massive open world. 21 Stunning Horizon Zero Dawn Screenshots 21 Images The Human Element Elsewhere, settlements and camps form a rag-tag civilization. Humans of this world have been reduced back to a tribal state, and each tribe has its own identity shaped by historical victories and grievances and various theories on the nature of their strange existence, devoid of a sense of their true history. Guerrilla has done an enormous amount of seductive world-building here, and I spent a great deal of time just wandering around settlements listening to elders tell elaborate tales of gods to children or seeking stories of misplaced vengeance in the crowds. Main missions cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world. \u201c It\u2019s at these settlements that you\u2019ll be given your missions, both the urgent, high-stakes main quests and the side-quests that pop up as little exclamation marks on you map. While the latter are as lengthy as the main missions, they do  quickly fall into regular fetch-quest patterns: go and find this thing, kill some things, return, collect reward. Though these make for a great excuse to destroy more machines and there is the occasional compelling storyline, I would have liked a little more originality to keep them from blurring together into one, and better rewards for completion in the late game, where XP ceases to matter next to the search for frustratingly scarce useful weapon mods. Main missions, on the other hand, cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world. I found myself switching between chasing the ghosts of the past in the deep, lonely bunkers of lost technology and solving the murder of a tribal leader, using my focus ability to track bloodstains and trace clues before facing off against a tribe of cultists in a climactic battle. Horizon encourages you to chase your own story, but help others a little on the way too. Its ultimate reveal - prior to a frenzied, heart-in-the-throat finale - is smart and provocative, and a great pay off to the journey."

        "id": "fb0250aaba5c0c22b358b10cb373c7b0",
        "Content": "With two major, groundbreaking features that set it head and shoulders above its current competition, the HTC Vive is the most capable and versatile of the pair of near-magical virtual reality headsets you can buy today. Thanks to sensors that track your position as you physically move around a room and allow you to use your hands to interact with the imaginary as though it were real, the Vive is vastly more effective at making me feel present within a game or other virtual environment than anything else I\u2019ve experienced. All of that comes with drawbacks, however, in the areas of ease of use, practicality for most homes, and most significantly, reliability. The $800 price tag might come as a shock to people who don\u2019t normally jump on new technologies in their first iterations, but relative to other transformative or high-end products (think the first iPhone, or a nice 27\u201d G-sync gaming monitor) that\u2019s not unreasonable for what you\u2019re getting. In addition to the high-quality headset itself, the Vive\u2019s large box contains two room sensors (called Lighthouse beacons) and two hand-held controllers that easily explain the $200 price difference between the Vive and its rival, the Oculus Rift. Those devices enable the Vive\u2019s main competitive advantage: the spectacular \u201croom-scale VR\u201d capability. Above and beyond the already impressive concept of letting you look all around you as though you were in a virtual world, which is closely matched by the Rift, the Vive lets you explore and interact with those worlds without the abstraction of pushing buttons to represent your hands and feet moving. Instead, if you want to do something, you just do it. Based on a quick description these motion-tracked controls could easily be compared to Nintendo\u2019s Wii, Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, or Sony\u2019s Move, but that would be a misconception. The Vive\u2019s astonishingly precise tracking and one-to-one movement is so far ahead of anything any of those systems achieved it makes them look like broken toys by comparison. Instead of clumsily translating three-dimensional movements onto a two-dimensional screen, the Vive makes your in-game representation move exactly the way you do. If you see something in front of you, you can reach out and touch it just the way you\u2019d expect to, with almost enough accuracy to thread a needle. And if you put a controller down, its in-environment representation lets you see exactly where it is \u2013 you can reach and pick it up naturally. That\u2019s a mind-blowing experience, and a truly revolutionary way to interact with games. Making it work is the tricky part. The ideal setup for a Vive is elaborate and demanding: you\u2019ll need a PC with at least an Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290 (nearly identical to the Rift\u2019s PC specifications) in order to maintain a 90 frames-per-second refresh rate, and a large, open space of at least six feet by five feet (1.8m by 1.5m) \u2013 larger, if possible. That\u2019s hard to come by in most homes without making big changes. I was able to create a space of six feet by 12 feet in my family room by shoving aside a coffee table, and that space was big enough for all but one of the games I\u2019ve tried. However, it\u2019s not a situation I\u2019ll be able to maintain permanently. That totals five different power cables. \u201c Once you\u2019ve cleared the way, the real work begins. Each of the two included Lighthouse sensor boxes (three-inch black cubes on small adjustable stands that can be screwed into the wall for permanent installation) needs to be placed in opposite corners of your space and plugged into the wall, then connected to each other by a long included cable (supposedly optional, but I had no luck making them work without it); the Vive headset\u2019s long cord bundle leads to a breakout box that needs power from the wall in addition to a single USB 3.0 connection and an HDMI or DisplayPort connection; and the wireless controllers need USB charging cables. That totals five different power cables (three of which must be plugged in at all times) compared to the Rift\u2019s zero. All of this makes setup and teardown of a Vive at least a 15-minute process, as opposed to five for the Rift. Note that even if you can\u2019t accommodate room-scale VR\u2019s demands for unobstructed floor space, the Vive will still offer you something the Rift currently can\u2019t: those controllers can be used in many games while in a stationary seated or standing position. As long as you have room to move your arms, and you have a gamepad (not included) for games that don\u2019t support them, the Vive can do everything the Rift can do and more. This 1.2lb bug-eye-looking headset is somewhat front-heavy, but not uncomfortable. \u201c This 1.2lb (555g), bug-eye-looking headset is somewhat front-heavy, but not uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The fat velcro straps on the sides and top secures it firmly to your face, and I found the soft foam that contacts with your face to be gentler on my skin than the Rift. (I still end up with a light red impression around my eyes after prolonged, multi-hour play, but nothing nearly as noticeable as the indented lines from the Rift.) As a large-headed individual, I appreciate the larger maximum extended size of the Vive as opposed to the Rift, and as someone who frequently shares it the headset with others it\u2019s great that it includes a second replaceable foam piece in the box. Like the Rift (because it\u2019s the only comparable product we have to reference right now) the field of view on the Vive looks much like what you\u2019d see while wearing ski goggles or scuba gear. Directly comparing the two the Vive\u2019s field of view is slightly larger, but it\u2019s not a significant enough difference I\u2019d have noticed if I weren\u2019t looking for it. And also like the Rift, the Vive\u2019s screen is actually two OLED screens with a combined resolution of 2160x1200. That gives you vision that\u2019s clear enough to read text and appreciate detail in environments and character models, but the pixel density is still low enough that you can make out individual pixels, especially in bright environments. But anytime I was moving, I lost sight of those pixels quickly and felt fully immersed. Again comparing it to the Rift, the Vive has a smaller sweet spot on my face where everything lines up clearly, which means you may have to frequently adjust where it sits on your face to maintain focus. I also notice a pattern of concentric circles on the lenses that shows up from certain non-optimal angles. (This pattern is present on the Rift as well, but much more pronounced on the Vive.) In the Vive\u2019s favor, the gap around my nose through which the outside world shines through is slightly smaller. None of those is a major factor, but they\u2019re noticeable. A significant difference is that while the Vive packs an integrated microphone, it lacks built-in headphones. That can be seen as a benefit if you\u2019ve already invested in quality 3D-sound hardware and don\u2019t want to pay for another version that might not be as good as what you own. However, after the convenience of using the Rift\u2019s all-in-one setup, I found having to juggle a set of headphones \u2013 even wireless ones \u2013 with the Vive to be a hassle. You can\u2019t remove the Vive without removing the headphones first, and you must put the Vive on before the headset, which always left me groping to find it with my hands full of controllers. This made slipping in and out of VR more difficult, which is a drag because when you\u2019re cut off from the real world it\u2019s important to be able to come up for air once in awhile. To address this at least partially, a passthrough camera on the front of the headset can be used to peek into reality by tapping the home button on either controller to bring up the menu, or double-tapping to enable a Predator-like color-tinged outline of your real environment overlaid on the virtual one. Note that this extremely handy feature (the sole purpose of the camera\u2019s existence) is completely disabled by default, probably to avoid system conflicts that the software warns you about when you enable it in the preferences. I experienced no problems with it, though. The elephant in the room is the thick, three-cable bundle that tethers you to your PC. \u201c The elephant in the room is the thick, three-cable bundle that tethers you to your PC at all times as you move around the room, and there\u2019s no way around it: it sucks. You always have to be aware of this real-world obstacle that doesn\u2019t show up in the virtual world at all, and even though I quickly learned to step over it, kick it out of the way, or grab it and whip it away from me like Indiana Jones, it\u2019s the one constant reminder that you\u2019re not where you appear to be. Until science wizards figure out how to completely eliminate latency in wirelessly transmitted video, we\u2019ll be stuck with it. The Vive\u2019s other unique feature is the light and versatile controllers, which reproduce your hand movements in virtual space with such precision that it feels las though my hand is actually in that world \u2013 or whatever other virtual item a developer chooses to turn it into. A gun, a sword or shield, a spaceship, a paintbrush \u2013 you name it. With triggers on the bottom and buttons on top, the handle resembles a more ergonomic Wiimote or a pistol grip, and the thumb touchpads are responsive and versatile, serving as anything from a gesture surface to scroll wheel to being subdivided into multiple buttons. Two side buttons let you squeeze the grip as a form of intuitive input. That ring-shaped piece on the top is there for technical tracking reasons, and hasn\u2019t (so far) been used for anything in a game. It should be noted that while many games use the controllers to represent human hands, they\u2019re not especially well suited for that task - there\u2019s no way to intuitively control articulated fingers, for instance.  While the controllers are light, they feel built to take a hit. I can confirm through unintentional testing that they\u2019ll survive being banged against the occasional wall without visible damage. I definitely recommend using the hand straps to prevent accidental drops or throws, because like the Wiimote, you\u2019re often encouraged to swing them wildly. I\u2019ve also been satisfied with the battery life, which lasts me at least four or five hours of gaming on a charge. That said, a charging dock station for the controllers would\u2019ve been nice. Running around a room with a blindfold on, waving your arms at imaginary objects and trying to avoid tripping over a cord over sounds pretty dangerous, but the Vive\u2019s integrated Chaperone system all but completely solves that problem. During the setup process, you\u2019ll draw a border around your cleared play space with a controller, and the Vive\u2019s software will use that data to construct a virtual cage around your space that will illuminate whenever you get near the edge. I\u2019ve experienced frequent tracking glitches that have my hands disappear or appear to float away from me. \u201c While the Vive\u2019s tracking technology is incredibly precise, it\u2019s considerably less than 100 percent reliable, and that\u2019s the major frustration that prevents me from recommending the Vive hardware without caveats right now. Despite getting an all-clear from the setup software and green LEDs on the devices indicating everything is operating as intended, I\u2019ve experienced frequent tracking glitches that have my hands disappear or appear to float away from me uncontrollably, or worse, having my viewpoint move independently from my head for a moment before the screen goes blank to prevent motion sickness. All of this happens while standing in clear unobstructed view of the two Lighthouse sensors. Moving the sensors around randomly sometimes makes it better, but then it becomes worse again before magically fixing itself for a few hours. Is it due to reflected light from nearby windows? I have no idea, so I don\u2019t know how to address it. (Using it at night with the lights off was also unreliable.) On the software side, SteamVR is a combination of polish and pitfalls. The setup process is guided step-by-step by an on-screen tutorial that calibrates your system with assistance from Valve\u2019s adorable 2D sign-people, but the problem is this setup is so fragile that many things can go wrong, and it offers few suggestions for how to fix them. I\u2019ve spent a few nights calibrating, recalibrating, and calibrating some more \u2013 time I would\u2019ve much rather spent playing a game. It also has obvious shortcomings, such as leaving the headset\u2019s screens turned on when it\u2019s clearly inactive (you\u2019d think a device that knows exactly when and how it\u2019s moving would be able to switch itself off when it\u2019s sitting motionless for a few minutes), and having no way to activate VR mode and turn the headset on without using the mouse and keyboard. On the other hand, the strength of being built on the established Steam store is that anyone who knows their way around Steam will be able to manage and sort their games in SteamVR, and the menu is quickly and smoothly accessible with one button at any time. Navigating the interface using a virtual laser pointer emitting from whichever controller you activated the menu from scrolling through the options with the thumb trackpad feels completely natural. It\u2019s certainly true that the selection of dozens of games available at launch is largely unimpressive for anyone who comes to VR expecting full-blown gaming experiences. The only thing currently available on Steam that\u2019d qualify as a full retail-style game is the gorgeous but slow-paced space commerce sim Elite: Dangerous, which is impressive in VR, but doesn\u2019t make use of room scale or the touch controllers. While we wait for promising VR-focused games like the industrial espionage-themed Budget Cuts (check out that playable demo!), most of what you\u2019ll find right now is clearly experimental, not unlike the first year\u2019s worth of games designed for touch-screen phones and tablets. It sounds strange, but believe me: they\u2019re incredible. \u201c Highlights include the free The Lab from Valve itself, which is made up of a collection of tech demos and minigames that stand out above nearly everything else. An archery game where you draw a bow and let fly to pick off invaders who march toward your castle, a fully 3D bullet-hell shoot-em-up where your hand represents a spaceship evading countless projectiles, and a first-person Angry Birds-style catapult game in the Portal universe where Wheatley-like personality cores spout hilarious dialogue before being launched at explosive barrels are all very short, but represent some of the best experiences I\u2019ve had in VR. You\u2019ll also find some near-photo-realistic virtual recreations of environments like Venice and the Icelandic countryside where a cute robot dog will fetch sticks you throw for him. It sounds strange, but believe me: they\u2019re incredible. Job Simulator is one of the more elaborate games, and often hilarious. It\u2019s a comedic simulation of a simulation conducted by robots who don\u2019t understand the point of everyday human tasks, so you\u2019re given simple objectives in the four included jobs that can be accomplished by ridiculous means: if you\u2019re asked to prepare a smoothie, you can add dish soap to the mixture, and the robots don\u2019t care. It\u2019s ultimately variations on the same joke over and over, but discovering object interactions leads to a lot of good physical comedy. Plenty of smaller games are at least briefly entertaining as well. Audio Shield is a vigorous rhythm game where you block incoming blue and orange projectiles with the corresponding shield on your right and left hands, SelfieTennis lets you whack a ball back and forth to yourself as you teleport to maintain a volley, and Space Pirate Trainer is a simple but fun dual-wielding shooting gallery where time slows down to let you dodge incoming projectiles. And then there are the non-gaming applications, which are equally exciting. Google\u2019s Tiltbrush gives us a look at what might become an entirely new art medium of 3D painting - imagine waving a sparkler around and having the streaks of light hang permanently in the air, and you\u2019ve got an idea of what kind of art you can create in VR. Virtual Desktop is an essential app for using your Vive as a monitor for anything you\u2019d do on your PC, including watching movies on Netflix or YouTube. (Conventional games can be played in Theater mode, which puts you in a virtual auditorium with a large screen in front of you.)

        "Content": "Playing classic adventure Grim Fandango again is like seeing a skeleton get up and start walking around \u2013 which is exactly what afterlife travel agent Manny Calavera does in this Day of the Dead-inspired tale. It joyously exhumes the corpses of both fallen genre titan LucasArts and Grim Fandango itself, whose out-of-print and unsupported status had rendered it nearly impossible to find \u2013 let alone play \u2013 over the past decade and a half. Adventure games tend to age better than other genres because their gameplay is so story-focused, and so it\u2019s no surprise that Grim Fandango remains a fine experience in 2015. However, one missed opportunity for improvement is that, like many games of the \u201890s, there is no tutorial available. You\u2019re simply thrown headfirst into the adventure, and any \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d questions that would\u2019ve been answered by the thick instruction manual you were expected to read before you played (heck, it was part of the fun!) are left a mystery here. As a $15 download, Grim Remastered obviously doesn\u2019t include a booklet. And while you can check the button layout in the Options screen \u2013 Fandango feels completely natural on DualShock 4, by the way, and there\u2019s a new feels-like-it-was-always-there point-and-click interface option on PC \u2013 you\u2019re given no other context for what you\u2019re actually supposed to do. If you\u2019re familiar with Telltale\u2019s modern adventures, you\u2019ll have a basic idea, but Grim is a much deeper, more complex quest than the Walking Deads and Wolves Among Us you\u2019re used to nowadays. As I progressed, Grim reminded me that adventure games of yore expected a lot more from players than most games do today. That\u2019s hardly a bad thing, but it can be a bit jarring if you\u2019re coming to this classic for the first time. Over this beautiful and dramatic 12-hour adventure, you\u2019ll have to talk to a lot of memorable characters, collect a lot of items, and use them in creative and often bizarre ways, so you\u2019ll need either an excellent memory or a notepad and pen to keep track of your current goals (especially if you take a day or two off in the middle of your playthrough). It\u2019s a lot to keep track of, and Grim Fandango won\u2019t help you out in any way. The four-year tale of Manny as he tries to work off spiritual debts by selling expedited afterlife travel to paradise (read: heaven) so he can eventually get there himself is a gripping one, packed with film noir influences, a stellar jazzy soundtrack, and light touches of comedy too. It\u2019s split into four years, with each one \u2013 particularly the film noir-heavy Year 2 \u2013 chock full of locations, characters, and items. Glottis, your netherworld demon sidekick whose sole reason to exist is to drive vehicles, is easily my favorite character \u2013 particularly as his role evolves into piano player, lounge singer, and shipman. But even the archetypal NPCs are well-written, well-acted, and generally interesting. I say this is a 12-hour story, but like any adventure game, you\u2019ll only progress as fast as you can solve puzzles, and that will vary depending on how good you are at sussing out wacky adventure game logic. Most of your challenges make sense, but I wouldn\u2019t call any of them flat-out easy. More often than not, there\u2019s something that requires you to dig into your gray matter a bit deeper than a modern game would. Frustration is inevitable \u2013 it\u2019s part of the genre \u2013 but when you finally figure out what you missed, it\u2019s incredibly rewarding. However, while I never flat-out cheated on any puzzles by looking up their solutions online , I do wish Grim Fandango Remastered had added a hint system similar to the stellar Monkey Island 1 and 2 Special Editions, which provided bigger and bigger hints as you continued to press the hint button before ultimately giving you the solution. The one puzzle that made me absolutely mental was (no spoilers) the multi-part counterfeit betting-stub machine task near the end of Year 2. Be ready for that. Just as the excellent craft behind Grim\u2019s story means it\u2019s no less engrossing today than it was in 1998, its 3D graphics have also held up surprisingly well. Because Grim has such unique art direction, its low-polygon characters haven\u2019t aged as poorly as you\u2019d expect. In fact, the original pre-rendered backgrounds help the graphics look borderline modern. Thus, switching back and forth between the original and remastered graphics on the fly only changes the characters, whose detail and lighting are cleaned up for 2015. The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a true 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (a stretched 16:9 option is available, but it looks awful), which means we\u2019re stuck with black bars on the sides of our screens.

It\u2019s filled with fun facts and humorous retrospective observations about what was going on in the heads of the tightly bonded team who put this thing together. They\u2019re sprinkled liberally throughout the story, and they\u2019re only a button press away. And since the commentary almost never spoils puzzles, I highly recommend turning it on in the Special Features menu before you begin. PlayStation Vita Impressions Should you elect to play Grim Fandango Remastered on the Vita, you\u2019ll be in for a portable treat. The handheld version cleverly offers both the PS4\u2019s gamepad controls and the PC\u2019s point-and-click controls simultaneously, letting you mix and match on the fly and on a whim. Visuals look clean on the Vita\u2019s screen, too, though the 4:3 aspect ratio is extra painful here because of the already limited screen real estate (again, do not attempt to use the hideous 16:9 stretching option). On a similar note, the Vita\u2019s screen also occasionally stings during scenes when the camera is pulled way back, making Manny a mere few pixels tall. But Cross-Buy and Cross-Save functionality means your $15 gets you both PlayStation versions, and you\u2019re able to seamlessly carry your save files back and forth between the two. That\u2019s a huge plus."

        "Content": "The best thing about playing Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is that it makes me feel over-the-top powerful without sacrificing the fear of defeat. It\u2019s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is what\u2019s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning. A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as Talion, a former Ranger of Gondor, is ritually executed along with his family. Talion\u2019s spirit is then bound to an amnesiac elf ghost and returned to Middle-earth for vengeance against Sauron\u2019s forces. It\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars, but it\u2019s well-acted. It makes decent use of Gollum, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly Ratbag the comic-relief uruk, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army. My interest in the plot dwindled toward the end, but it does a fair job of explaining why Talion has such sweet supernatural powers with his sword, dagger, and bow. Much like in the Batman: Arkham games, you can choose to stealthily pick off enemies one at a time, or dive head-first into a brawl with dozens of opponents and beat the crap out of them with a smoothly animated series of attacks and counters. Unlike Batman, of course, Mordor\u2019s involve great, gory decapitation and stabbing animations, and outside of the scripted story missions, there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas. It\u2019s enticingly freeform. Acrobatically slaughtering Sauron\u2019s ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jackson\u2019s movies, and it\u2019s more fun to do than to watch. Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman \u2013 which is to say it\u2019s amazing. Mordor\u2019s take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that you\u2019re almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what he\u2019s doing and counter instantly. It\u2019s extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though it\u2019s kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, it\u2019s great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know you\u2019re there. What really sets the feel of Mordor\u2019s combat apart from the Batman games is that it\u2019s really easy to get into trouble, especially early on. If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds, or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map, you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle. Picking out the shield bearers and ax-wielding berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when you\u2019re completely surrounded, and it goes downhill from there. Health doesn\u2019t recharge much on its own, and until you can upgrade your health pool, you may find yourself succumbing to death by a thousand pinpricks if you don\u2019t retreat. Things got a lot easier a few hours in when I\u2019d leveled up and unlocked more of Talion\u2019s skill tree so that I could build up combos quicker, execute two enemies for the price of one, and even fight mounted on a huge, rancor-like graug who pops uruks into his mouth like jellybeans. It feels powerful, but I still don\u2019t feel invincible even with everything nearly maxed out. And what\u2019s really cool about Mordor is that whether you win or lose a fight, something interesting happens. If you kill an uruk captain, he drops a rune that can be slotted into one of your weapons for bonuses. Some of them changed the way I played, like the legendary rune that extended the amount of time I have to score another hit before my combo count resets by 10 seconds, and one that made me immune to poison attacks. If any uruk kills you, even if he\u2019s a random grunt, he levels up and earns new abilities and some cooler armor. Maybe he gets promoted up the chain of command. You\u2019ll definitely run into him again later to settle the score, and he\u2019ll have a new introduction taunt about his victory when you meet. It makes each death feel meaningful. Most uruk captains do tend to die too quickly to really become memorable, but some definitely did. (Sometimes they\u2019ll survive being apparently killed by you and come back with a scarred face.) For that reason, and to identify the arrival of a significant threat, I never really got tired of the action-pausing cutscenes that play when a captain shows up. There are enough different voices and multiple possible lines that I rarely saw repeats, and the uruk faces are surprisingly well animated and expressive. Even though the hierarchy is a pretty simple system when you understand what it\u2019s doing, and realize that these uruk captains aren\u2019t actually roaming the map in real time, it\u2019s great to play with. Uruks have an internal power struggle for rank, and you can interrupt their duels, feasts, hunts, and more to pick fights and kill off Uruk captains and ultimately the powerful Warchiefs. Each captain has his own randomized strengths and vulnerabilities, so every fight is at least a little different. I ran into a couple of guys who seemed invulnerable to almost everything, which was a little annoying \u2013 one fight took me about 15 minutes of repeatedly chasing down a captain who was invulnerable to my sword and dagger and filling him with arrows trying to damage him faster than his health regenerated. Eventually, though, they all went down. In the second act, you transition from the bleak, brown map to a refreshingly greener-looking area of Mordor. There, Talion and his elf-ghost buddy suddenly realize he can mind-control uruks and turn them against each other. (It feels like something might\u2019ve been cut out there.) That\u2019s even more fun, because the ability to \u201cbrand\u201d an enemy gives you the choice of either killing a captain for a rune reward or controlling him and siccing him on one of his former allies. Taking an uruk alive can be trickier than lopping off his head, though, so it\u2019s more challenging to accomplish the new goal of mind-controlling five Warchiefs. I love how you have the option to mind-control a Warchief\u2019s lieutenants, then kill the Warchief, to watch your minion become the new Warchief. I did notice that the mind-control visual effect caused some slowdown on the PlayStation 4 version (the Xbox One version has yet to arrive for testing), but it didn\u2019t interfere much with combat. Charging through the decent but less-exciting story missions would probably take around 12 hours, but the goal of killing or dominating the Warchiefs is much more time-consuming and interesting. I spent around 25 hours to reach the end, and there\u2019s still a lot of challenging side missions based around testing sword, bow, and dagger skills left to do. And, of course, lots of collectables and wildlife-hunting challenges. 6GB? Now THOSE are textures! On the PC side Mordor also compares to the Batman games, in that it\u2019s of good quality. There are even some enhanced graphics settings, including an ultra-high texture setting that requires a full 6GB of video memory. My only issue with it is some awkward menu controls, but most of those are customizable and those that aren\u2019t aren\u2019t too inconvenient to get used to. Xbox One Version - September 30, 2014 After a day with Shadow of Mordor on Xbox One, I can confidently recommend it just as strongly as the PS4 and PC versions. True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin - the PS4 runs at a slightly higher resolution and the PC has better lighting than either (and all the resolution your hardware can handle) - but it performs at roughly the same clip as the PS4 version and provides effectively the same experience. That means what appears to our eyes to be a framerate that fluctuates somewhere between 30 and 60, excluding occasional slowdowns when \"combat-branding\" an uruk in the midst of a large group of enemies. If you have an Xbox One, there's no reason to avoid this version."

        "Title": "The Wolf Among Us Episode 5: Cry Wolf Review",
        "Subtitle": "Fairy Tale Ending",
        "Content": "Watching the credits roll on Cry Wolf, the fifth and final episode of Telltale\u2019s The Wolf Among Us, felt like waking up from a violent dream filled with satisfying answers. While it leaves a hint of ambiguity to keep some mystery in the world of Fabletown, Cry Wolf ties a ribbon around the entire series in expert fashion. It pays special attention to rewarding those of us who\u2019ve kept note of minor details, characters, and events since Episode 1 last year. It embraces the series\u2019 many storytelling genres, and left me going over specific scenes and actions in my head long into the night.  This episode begins with a bang, with Bigby surrounded by the Crooked Man and his nightmarish posse. Cry Wolf is drenched in action, but instead of just titillating, the violence is there to allow us and Bigby to come to terms with our decisions from throughout the whole season. As I picked who to attack first in that initial brawl, or to focus on during an exhilarating car chase, I could feel the weight of every tense character relationship and tough decision I'd made since Episode 1 behind me. It all built smoothly up to this. The combination of frantic Quick Time Events and branching dialogue trees with legitimate consequences make the actual act of playing Wolf Among Us a more active experience than a simple choose-your-own adventure story. Cry Wolf also does an excellent job of letting us paint Bigby Wolf in whatever shade of gray we choose. Whether he\u2019s the righteous sheriff, fairytale monster, or something in between, Telltale empowers us to make this Bigby our Bigby, and by extension, this story is our story in a way that most adventure games can't manage.  Most of the side characters, good, bad, and glamoured, get just enough time in Cry Wolf for a satisfying conclusion. Georgie, the Crooked Man, and Nerissa specifically get a welcome dose of added dimension. The only disappointment on this front comes from Snow White, or the lack thereof. Seeing as how she\u2019s been a major character and plot point since the beginning, having her relegated to a single, albeit meaty scene left me feeling a bit disappointed.  Episode 5 manages to cram many different storytelling genres into its 90-minute duration, but each of them gets enough breathing room to feel like Telltale had an important reason to include it. The horror of finally facing off against Bloody Mary, the magic of watching Bigby fall back on his fairytale roots, the drama of having your choices judged by the citizens of Fabletown, and the overall air of noir that\u2019s hovered over the series since its opening credits all jive together wonderfully.  This final episode, especially the final scene, leaves a much-appreciated ambiguity over the entire series. It\u2019s tough to talk about while remaining vague, but let\u2019s just say that many of Wolf\u2019s noir influences have never been more apparent. Unlike the Season 1 finale of The Walking Dead, Wolf leaves a lot of smart, intriguing questions on the table, and it\u2019s up to perceptive players to fill in the gap. And unlike the wheel-spinning of Episode 4 , every scene in the finale feels necessary, personal, and ultimately rewarding. When I finally made one of the series\u2019 most agonizing decisions, seeing the reactions of my fellow Fables brought me back to those powerful waning moments at the end of The Walking Dead. Your actions can lead to a handful of very different endings, in both what's on the screen, as well as how you interpret those events. The central events remain unchanged, but characters can live or die, and mysteries can remain opened or closed depending on what kind of a character you want to be. Going back and seeing just how different things can play out made me appreciate Telltale's storytelling all the more.",

        "Content": "Tearaway is the best game I\u2019ve played on the PlayStation Vita. It\u2019s a joyous experience that wants to celebrate individual creativity and the power of storytelling, so it\u2019s just as well that it never runs out of ideas itself. In fact, Tearaway\u2019s eager to show you new things right until the very end. It does things I\u2019ve never experienced before, and along the way showcases, quite magically, just what a uniquely capable gaming device the Vita can be.  It\u2019s a simple story, told in a wonderful way. You control iota or atoi (depending on gender), who is both messenger and message \u2013 look closely and you\u2019ll see his head is really an envelope \u2013 as he\u2019s tries to deliver himself to you. That\u2019s because in the world of Tearaway you become a character, with the front camera pulling your moving image into the game, casting you in the role of the sun.  All Touchy Feely  It\u2019s one of the many, many ways in which Tearaway makes full and imaginative use of the Vita\u2019s wide array of inputs and sensors. It\u2019s constantly inviting you to become part of its world, to reach it and play with it. Since this is such a large part of the experience, I was pleased with just how effortlessly intuitive it all was. Objects stamped with a dense pattern of PlayStation buttons tell you to drum or tickle the rear touchpad, while anything covered with a shiny fingerprint texture needs prodding or pulling or peeling on the touchscreen.  And not one of these conceits ever devolves into facile gimmick, thanks to the creative wit with which they\u2019re introduced and elaborated upon. Everything just adheres to the internal logic of this unusual world of paper. For instance, sometimes when you press on the touchpad, you end up ripping a hole into Tearaway\u2019s paper world with what looked like my fingers wiggling around, moving objects, opening up pathways. But it\u2019s the little touches that help sell the illusion, like the rear camera ingeniously pulling a feed of the environment beneath the Vita, so it really looks like the world is paper thin. The words \u201ccut and paste\u201d could apply to Tearaway\u2019s arts-and-crafts sensibility, but never to its design. It\u2019s inspired and continually surprising.  The sound effects and distinctive art directions are a big part in really bringing this world to life. Touch screens are notoriously slippery, impersonal things to interact with, but the world of Tearaway feels truly tangible. It\u2019s a world of creases, folds, wrinkles, and different thicknesses of paper and card. The animation also has a slight jauntiness, recalling the feel of stop-frame animation and reminding me of classic children\u2019s television. The sound effects are maybe even better \u2013 every fold and rip you introduce into the world feels real. It all combines to create an endlessly charming illusion of an inanimate world of paper that has miraculously sprung to life.  Right until the very end Tearaway has new things to show you. The accelerometer, for instance, is only introduced towards the end, yet presents entirely new challenges. Meanwhile Iota himself regularly acquires new skills \u2013 he can scrunch into a ball and acquires a particularly useful accordion \u2013 and they expand the horizon of what\u2019s possible. And this is where one of my slight criticisms sheepishly creeps in. Tearaway is fairly short, taking me around five hours to finish, and while it has more to show in that time than games twice as big, I wanted to spend more time using its brilliant mechanics, exploring its unique world and applying my newfound abilities. This is a nice problem, of course, and there\u2019s some solace to be found in the fact that you\u2019re allowed to return to earlier stages with all your abilities and items to hunt down collectibles.  Combat is another weakness. Periodically Iota has to vanquish scraps \u2013 noisy little fellas made from strips of grim newspaper \u2013 by throwing them into each other or jumping on their bellies. It picks up slightly when Iota is more capable, but for the majority of the time you\u2019re held in a small area until each scrap is unravelled. It\u2019s definitely the least interesting and developed mechanic, feeling less like something that\u2019s supposed to be entertaining and more like a way to halt your progress and stop you from breezing through unchallenged. But since it feels so at odds with what Tearaway is really all about, it\u2019s not hugely detrimental. Looks Good On Paper  The look and design of Tearaway\u2019s world is yet another source of delight. Despite being made entirely from paper, there\u2019s a lot of variety, from meadows, farms, and forests to laboratories, caverns, and sand dunes. And unlike Media Molecule\u2019s LittleBigPlanet series, the creativity burden isn\u2019t really on you. That freedom comes in scripted moments of creativity that, every now and then, invite you to embellish the carefully design world. Whether that\u2019s designing a majestic crown for one of the many personable squirrels or a pair of mittens for Iota to wear as he braves frozen slopes, the implementation of this is superb. Presented with different-coloured sheets of construction card, you\u2019re invited to draw whatever design you can imagine using the touchscreen. Scissors then cut free your creation, and you discard the excess paper with a quick flick of your finger. Cards of different colours can even be layered to create more extravagant designs. Once done, this design is instantly brought into the world, and I still can\u2019t believe how flawlessly this works.  Not only is it fun, it\u2019s also thematically appropriate. Tearaway loves storytelling, particularly the folk tradition of passing on a tale but making it your own during the telling. And it does just that. The truth is most people will have a similar experience playing Tearaway \u2013 it\u2019s fairly linear, after all \u2013 but the ways in which you interact with its world will make it unforgettably yours."

        "Content": "Sam Fisher is back, and he is not in a good mood. Of all the smart decisions made in crafting a new Splinter Cell title, this might be the best one developer Ubisoft Montreal made. Sam's angry and you hear it in every grunted line of dialogue, can see it in the brutal takedowns and interrogation moves and feel it pulsating through Sam with every step. That anger, that aggressiveness is built not only into the story but the gameplay changes as well. It was a huge risk deviating from the trial-and-error style that made the series famous, but it paid off. Splinter Cell Conviction is awesome.  The story takes place a few years after the end of Splinter Cell: Double Agent. Don't worry, if you never finished that game, you'll get caught up quickly as to what's going on. Sam's daughter was killed, he murdered his best friend Lambert, and he split from Third Echelon, the government agency he'd called home for years. With new evidence leading to his daughter's killer, a tormented and semi-retired Sam Fisher is called back into action. Turns out the people responsible for his daughter's fate are planning a major terrorist attack on Washington D.C. This is going to be one long day for Jack Bauer Sam Fisher.   Watch the video review. Conviction sets itself apart from its predecessors with its pacing. You're always being pushed forward, so much so that I played through the entire single-player campaign in one sitting without even realizing I'd been up all night. Ubisoft pulled off a few magic tricks to make this happen.  There are no in-game loading screens unless you die. From the moment the game starts, you never sit around waiting for something to happen. Levels are loaded while you're watching slickly presented cutscenes. Fancy new projection technology integrates text into the scenery to point you towards your goal, and back story is shown with movies playing out on walls as you progress through a level. These things aid in keeping players immersed in the world, but the real reason things feel so fluid is the change in approach to stealth.  In Conviction, stealth is about speed.  Sam moves fast. Really fast. He can get in and out of cover quickly, shimmy across ledges faster than the Prince of Persia and beat a hasty retreat if he gets into trouble. Sam's codename used by Third Echelon is \"panther,\" and that's fitting. In past Splinter Cell games, enemies were meant to be avoided; in Conviction, Sam is a hunter.  He isn't avoiding enemies, he's stalking them.  Sam lurks in the shadows, finds his moment to pounce and strikes with deadly efficiency. There may be a dozen men, fully armed and with extensive combat training closing in, but they're the ones who should be worried. You feel like the ultimate badass thanks to some generous aiming assists that let you easily put bullets into approaching enemy noggins.    Interrogations  You might have heard a lot about the interactive interrogation scenes. While these are nice little moments, they aren't as special or in-depth as you might have imagined. They might look cool, but they aren't any fun.   Rather than force players to eyeball a variety of meters to determine their level of stealth, Ubisoft made things very obvious. If you're in the shadows and impossible to see, the color bleeds out and things go black and white. The minute you're in the light, the color comes back. This easy sense of whether you are hidden or exposed enables you to move quickly through the environment and plan your route of attack on the fly.  Shadows and light are just half the stealth equation. The other half is the cover system. The cover is not at all like Gears of War, where you're sucked against a wall. Squeeze the left trigger and if you are near an object, you'll take cover behind it. Release the trigger and you immediately disengage, or you can hold down the trigger and move away from cover with no problem. You're never attached to a surface. In fact, you can hold down the trigger when out in the open and Sam will crouch, doing his best to minimize his visibility.  This is the best cover system I've ever used. Every other game needs to change, because I can't go back.   Learn how to Mark & Execute enemies. Should you be spotted, the best thing to do is retreat. Get out of sight and a white silhouette appears, marking your Last Known Position. The AI will focus on this spot, because it's where they think you're hiding. They'll unload some shots, maybe toss a grenade and then make their way towards the spot to see if they got you. On Realistic difficulty -- the only way you should play Conviction -- the AI is very sharp and won't be fooled for long. You can use the Last Known Position to your advantage. Flank your enemies when their attention is on your silhouette, then take them out before they realize what's going on.  Using shadows and cover, you stalk your prey, and when you're close enough, you can perform a hand-to-hand takedown. There are dozens (probably more than a hundred) of these. They're an excellent reward for being sneaky. My favorite is shooting a guy in the leg and as he crumples downward, popping him in the chin with my silenced pistol. But the system isn't perfect. You bash in a door with the same button as a hand-to-hand takedown. Attempt to quietly kill an enemy near a door and you may end up kicking in the door and causing a ruckus. Occasional glitches aside, stealth kills look cool, avoid attracting attention and earn you the ability to execute.  The Mark & Execute system is probably the most controversial change to the Splinter Cell series. You can tag or \"mark\" enemies, putting a big arrow over their heads and then executing them with the press of a button. So long as the mark is red, you are guaranteed a kill. As it's described, this would seem like a \"win\" button that would make Splinter Cell too easy. Far from it. You have to work to earn the right to execute. Use it once and you must perform another stealth takedown to activate the execution option again. More importantly, executing does not equal \"stealthily execute.\" If you aren't careful, you can easily expose yourself to enemies when you enter execution mode. There are often more enemies than you could ever mark, so it's not as if you run through tagging and killing with ease.   Each weapon has its own unique properties, including the number of available marks. This is a great way to balance the game while adding a bit of strategy to how you gear up before heading into action. Do you take the low-powered Five-Seven pistol because it has the most marks (four) or do you up your firepower to another gun, sacrificing the marks?   Mark & Execute is a great addition and doesn't ruin Splinter Cell in any way. The only drawback is that sometimes you'll hit Execute and a targeted enemy will pass behind a wall. You'll still score the kill, but your bullet with defy physics and phase through the obstruction to hit your target.  All of these new gameplay elements are quickly explained in the single-player campaign. These things are so intuitive, that the tutorial is over before you know it. The campaign is a brisk and enjoyable five-hour experience that has only two odd spots.  Early on, there is a flashback to 20 years ago in Iraq. Out in broad daylight, all stealth is eliminated and Splinter Cell becomes nothing more than a third-person shooter. The other section that sticks out is an area where, if spotted, you fail the mission. What a bad idea. This is what Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory fixed five years ago. Who wants instant-fail gameplay?   Archer and Kestrel, partners in crime. While the single-player campaign won't take long to beat, even on Realistic difficulty, it's just one piece of the larger package. There's a ton of content in Conviction: a totally separate co-op campaign, Hunter, Infiltration, and Last Stand modes. Plus, there's an an in-game challenge system to test your stealth skills.   Deniable Ops  There are three additional modes, playable alone or with a friend. Hunter has you killing a set number of enemies level-by-level; Infiltration is like Hunter, but with crazy laser alarms and an instant fail if you're spotted; and Last Stand has you protecting an EMP device from waves of incoming enemies.  The co-op is well worth discussing. It is, after all, better than the single-player campaign. Offering split-screen, System Link and online support, you and a friend take on the roles of Third Echelon agent Archer and Russian Voron agent Ketrel. The co-op story is a prequel to the single-player campaign and has the two teaming up to hunt down some missing WMDs. While both Archer and Kestrel have the same moves as Sam, they must work together to make it through four unique environments.  Live together or die alone. That's the motto for Splinter Cell's co-op. If your friend dies, the mission fails. That means you must watch each other's back. Fortunately, you can heal your fallen friend before he bleeds out. And if your pal is careless and gets grabbed by an enemy, he can elbow his captor's face to gain a bit of separation before you cap him.   Check out the launch trailer. The ultimate joy of co-op is marking and executing enemies in tandem. Archer and Kestrel share their marks. So even if your buddy marks someone, if you have the angle, you can hit the execute button to take them down. When you both have line-of-sight on marked enemies, time slows down for a few seconds after an execution move begins. If your friend taps the execute button, he can join in. This often leads to double-shots to a villain's dome. "

As the middle tale in a sci-fi epic, nods to 'The Empire Strikes Back' are inevitable \u2013 and in a very real way, the middle instalment in the Mass Effect series is equally dark and more involved; characters appear richer, the settings comfortably familiar yet foreign and fresh, and the gameplay now evolving, shifting and streamlining.  Stepping back and viewing Mass Effect 2 on its own merits highlights just how much more focussed the experience is structurally; the heavier combat focus is noticeable, as is the lack of planet-side exploration (which was admittedly poorly implemented in the first game). Clearly though, this is the product of BioWare's 'A' team (not in the Mr. T sense), such is the level of polish, professionalism and quality.  After a smashing introduction, either after importing your previous saved game or starting anew, you're back in control of Commander Shepard ; hero of the people or wild-eyed renegade with a sour attitude and some gnarly facial scarring that reminded us of Too Human's Baldur. Tasked with assembling a crew by the mysterious 'Illusive Man' (voiced by a deliciously scene-chewing Martin Sheen ) and ultimately reporting to his somewhat controversial faction, the path is laid out in front of you \u2013and how you get there is a terrific blend of linear progression and freeform role-playing that was established in the first game.

In a sometimes confronting way, BioWare has managed to do what few other games have done successfully in the past \u2013 tackle the issue of cultural insensitivity and racism on a massive scale - always with balance and a degree of moral ambiguity most games can only dream of. Whole races are maligned and, as a trigger-happy (or biotic totin') human, you're more-often-than-not approached with a level of apprehension from other species and races. As the backbone for a greater conflict, it's fascinating stuff.  It's no secret to say that your band of space farers is by definition 'rag-tag';  you'll have your favourite characters to guide through the branching plotlines and even the most flawed and disturbing companions ultimately fascinate with their complexity and depth. This really is one of the best written games we've played in a long time \u2013 perhaps even since the original Mass Effect.  It's interesting to note the way Bioware has tackled the idea of the 'default' path, too \u2013 if you're coming into this series starting at the second game, an introductory training mission fills in the gameplay gaps for newcomers and the story makes certain assumptions and default decisions about where the game's story is heading. That's an interesting result even for players who made some radical decisions in the first game. Our advice? For the full experience, make sure you sink the dozen or so hours necessary into the original Mass Effect. For people who already have, do yourself a big favour and play through this second instalment twice; once with your own character and once as BioWare directs it. You'll find some fascinating differences along the way.   Buying into the character interplay in Mass Effect 2 is critical. Fortunately, the story is so great that you'll lose yourself in it.  In addressing perceived criticisms of the original game, new gameplay systems abound; gone are the superficial vehicular planet exploration missions \u2013 for good and ill. While it was unfocussed and sometimes just plain boring in the first Mass Effect, it was refreshingly alien to stand atop a burnt red plain and stare at twin suns before diving over an edge and entering the fray. That sense of wonderment is occasionally longed for. To make up for this, you can now react to distress beacons on the surface of a planet. This triggers a unique mission setting, generally a standalone area (such as a downed space frigate, teetering perilously on the edge of a mammoth chasm). The gameplay is still there, but the need to trek from point-to-point has been lessened. It was probably the right decision in the end, but we'd be lying if we said we didn't miss the open alien worlds a little bit.  Exploring the universe, through the Normandy's 3D map system, is now more tangible, physical act; your cursor represents the ship, and when trekking between solar bodies your fuel levels must be considered. It's not the greatest system, but it's an extra layer of challenge to consider.  Weapons and items have been scaled back in terms of numbers and distribution. You'll rarely come across new weapons and variants as you play \u2013 which, for loot-savvy RPG fans, might come as a shock, particularly after the first game. Instead, new weapons and equipment upgrades are now linked to the rare minerals you collect throughout the game \u2013 either in caches during missions or through scanning the planetary surfaces throughout the various galaxies and interpreting spikes in the waveform graphs as you go. These scans for minerals seem far too easy; the limit of your cache has much more to do with your patience than any real ability. That means you're rarely low on resources, which keeps you in fresh gear and ship upgrades.   A similarly retooled approach has been taken with the generic thermal clips for light weapons. All basic firearms now use the same core clips, negating the need for sorting through ammo. The rare heavy weapons ammunition now become a commodity and, critically, any character can use these heavy weapons, which is an important consideration when first choosing your character class. Even if you're a pure biotic character, you'll still get your hands on some impressive hardware throughout the adventure, so don't worry about feeling limited in this respect.  The core gameplay \u2013 essentially third-person shooting driven by well-disguised stats and dice-rolls \u2013 remains intact and has been further refined. The turn-based and real-time combat, hinging around radial menus and biotic ability cool-down times - remains about the best, most slickly implemented system out there, far exceeding even the console version of BioWare's own Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 though, the latter game has a vastly more traditional (and arguably deeper) approach to item distribution, squad management and tactics. The cover system has been improved and the use of squad tactics still plays a role, but the AI has noticeably improved, freeing up your need to micromanage if you don't particularly want to.  However, fans of the previous games will have to get used to the reworked equipment screens, which require you to find a specific terminal (or wait until the start of the next mission) in order to change your gear or adjust your weapons rollout. Experience points and stat-upgrades are still accessible through the main menu, thankfully \u2013 though these don't exactly have massive implications mid-level, so we'd have preferred better access to our gear instead.  The actual ends of missions can be jarringly abrupt for such a carefully plotted and nicely paced story. An immediate fade-to-black is often all you'll get before a strange and oddly out-of-place 'Mission Complete' screen pops up, recapping your progress and giving you a pat on the back.   Changes to the combat systems, Biotic abilities and class abilities have made an already impressive combat experience even better.  That's the essential gameplay in a nut; there were clearly some major design overhauls that were taken, and in some ways the experience feels a little bit pared back; the result though, is a mostly streamlined experience that's actually lighter on the tenets of role-playing \u2013 and that did bother us a little bit, given the depth and complexity of the first game. Whether that's an issue for you is strictly a matter of personal preference.  One thing that cannot be faulted though is Mass Effect 2's staggeringly thoughtful, tight and cohesive design ethic. This is about the most lovingly designed science fiction universe we've come across in many years \u2013 not in terms of scale (it's not GTA in space, after all), but in terms of sheer quality of the ideas . Fans of traditionalist science fiction stories will appreciate the maturity and logic of the settings, while gamers will find a lot to chew on with the level design.  Alien planets paint the air with debris, tainting the sky with shocking colour and impressive details. The different races out there in the universe all display brilliant characteristics, lovingly animated and injected with personality. The interplay of your team, their love triangles, conflicts and wants, are built off the back of where you visit, the decisions you make and how you react to their attitudes. All of this then links back to the overall plot of the story \u2013 and it is here the Mass Effect makes good on BioWare's promises of an epic, branching and potentially unique experience for every player.  The determination of Shepard's disposition \u2013 the Paragon / Renegade process \u2013 has been further tinkered with, too. Now, midway through many cutscenes, you can choose to interject with a positive or negative response to what's going on, ultimately opening up new conversation choices and adding to your overall good or bad, black or white, standing in the game. There is a serious flaw here, though \u2013 Mass Effect 2 only offers you one choice during these moments \u2013 either Renegade or Paragon. You have to opt out of these moments entirely if your personal preference isn't the one on screen. A better system would've allowed for both options at any given time.   This is about as complex as your item management gets. Good or bad thing? That's really up to you.  Texture loading issues are gone; technical bugs still remain, occasionally 'weirding out' so madly that Shepard might wander through a crate and clip through a wall or object and get stuck. It happens. It's not pretty, and having to restore from an autosave or previous save point is a hassle, but from a big picture standpoint, we can overlook these occasional annoyances and you can too.  Elevators are mercifully quick and painless now; a simple breakaway to a loading screen that tracks your location onboard your ship in lieu of the roughshod, nondescript elevator transition period. That said, Mass Effect 2 still has its major loading screens and pauses, so it's not exactly a seamless storytelling experience.  To say that this series gets the 'cinematic experience' right is an understatement. The score remains as evocative and well-composed as the first game; fantastic sound editing and positional audio build locations that thrum with futuristic techno from deep inside ghetto clubs one moment and then haunting strings in the alleyways the next. Even silence plays a large role; BioWare's composers (and directors) know when to simply take the foot off the gas. The voice-acting is roundly excellent \u2013 Adam Baldwin , Seth Green, Keith David and even Carrie-Anne Moss contribute years of experience to the cast and it really shows. This is superb stuff, complimented by a dialogue system that keeps the natural rhythm of speech flowing. "

        "Content": "Forget what you know about the Prince of Persia series. Let go the Sands of Time. Release your Warrior Within. Ubisoft Montreal has created a new Prince, in a new world, with a new female companion and a very different design philosophy. The longer you hold on to the style of last generation's Prince of Persia, the harder it will be to master the new one. Embrace the change and you're likely to fall in love with the new Prince (or at least his lovely companion).  When we meet the new Prince, he hardly seems princely at all. Little more than a smooth-talking thief, the Prince gets lost in a sandstorm while searching for his donkey, Farah. Of course, this is no ordinary sandstorm. This mystical phenomenon transports the Prince to another land, one seemingly made more of myth than reality. It's here where he fatefully runs into Elika, a beautiful barefoot descendant of a clan sworn to guard the prison of the evil god Ahriman. As bad luck would have it, the two meet just in time to witness Ahriman's release from his prison inside the Tree of Life. His escape releases corruption across the four areas of the world. This corruption will spread further unless the Prince and Elika can heal the infected lands. And so begins your adventure.   Limited Edition Content The Limited Edition for Prince of Persia is one you simply can't say no to. That's because it's a free upgrade to those who pre-ordered the game. So if you pre-ordered POP, this is what you're getting. The good news is, numerous stores have surplus copies of the Limited Edition at no additional cost. Prince of Persia: LE comes in a cardboard package designed to look like an ancient book. Inside is a standard-looking Prince of Persia game box. However, this box has a second disc. This DVD holds all of the extras for the Limited Edition. On the DVD you'll find an interesting \"Making of\" feature which gives some insight into the design philosophy behind the new POP. Also included is a fairly robust digital Prima strategy guide. The only problem with this guide is that it's on a DVD, meaning that unless you have it running off a laptop, you can't play Prince and reference the guide at the same time. A digital art book showcases some of the early concept art for POP's beautifully designed world. Lastly is the soundtrack. Six tracks from the game are provided, each played against a different piece of HD artwork. It's great to have the music from Prince offered here, but this is a DVD. That means most people can't just pop this into their car or rip the tracks to their iPod. Why not be creative and offer a free download code to your PC or just slide a soundtrack CD into the case? Of course, there's no reason to avoid the Limited Edition. It costs nothing extra. Even if the bonus DVD isn't the best we've seen, it is free. And free stuff is always welcome at my house.  This is a story about love. Not the love between the Prince and Elika, but between you and Elika. She is your constant guide, able to cast a spell at any time to show you the path to your goal. Come across a gap too great for the Prince to leap? Elika can assist with a double-jump move. Want some help in combat? Elika patrols the arena, ready to attack at your command. Miss a ledge and about to fall to your death? No sweat. Elika will always save you. Elika teaches you about corruption and the battle between Ahriman and Ormazd, about the history of the four infected areas and the tragic tales of all four bosses you must battle. She's your greatest asset and far more likeable than the boorish Prince. If Elika were just a little bit more real or I was just a tad more insane, I'd marry her.    With Fable II, Peter Molyneux attempted to make us care so greatly for our dog that we would sacrifice everything to protect him. He didn't fully succeed. But Ubisoft Montreal got it right. Elika is so significant to the story and gameplay that I found myself caring far more for her safety than that of my own character, the Prince. And the real genius is that Elika is as easy to control as pressing a single button. That's all it takes. Double jumps, combat moves and magic with Elika are all assigned to one button. Her AI is perfectly designed so that she never takes the lead and never gets in the way. And that's saying something, considering how quickly the Prince moves about the world.  In truth, Elika is really just a manifestation of actions we've been performing in games for years. We've all seen a double jump before and heroes who mix in magic with their swordplay. All Ubisoft did was take these very standard gameplay elements and give them a physical form. It's because Elika is such a natural extension of the gameplay that it's easy to care for her.  The rest of the Prince's actions are just as simple as commanding Elika. Each is assigned to its own button. There's one for acrobatics, your sword and your gauntlet. These work both while free running about the world and in combat. So when you are battling the Warrior -- a massive creature made of stone -- you instinctively know that if you want to slide between his legs, you're going to use the acrobatic button. Ease of use is a primary focus of the Prince's design. In fact, it's so easy, some may subconsciously overcomplicate things.  When you're running about the world, performing acrobatic sequences, it's difficult at first to shake off years of training in action platformers. But Prince is actually simpler (and in many ways better) than previous iterations of the series or other action games. You never need to hold down a button -- there is no pre-loading your jumps. That's because you can jump off a wall at any time. So if you jump to a wall and then hold down jump as you are landing, you aren't preloading the next jump, you're actually going to jump again.   To play Prince properly, you need to relax (yes, relax ) and feel the cadence of the Prince's movements. You will never furiously tap any button while free running. It's more like: Jump, pause, jump, pause, jump, use Elika, pause, jump. Finding the right rhythm can lead to some spectacular-looking and amazingly fluid sequences. And if you can't get the rhythm, your punishment is having the Prince briefly pause on beams and poles, waiting for you to get it together. When done right, you are treated to some spectacular animations both from the Prince and Elika. It's like playing a Cirque de Soleil video game at times.  This system isn't perfect. There are times when you might think you can drop down to a lower area safely, only to fail because there is a specific way the developers want you to reach that spot. And there were more than a few times when I leaped in a direction I hadn't intended (this happens most often when jumping off poles) or overshot a ledge seemingly because I was too effective in my approach. Fortunately, these issues are more the exception than the rule. For the most part, Prince of Persia handles brilliantly and manages to create an excellent sense of fluidity.  Combat follows a similar philosophy to acrobatics. This is not a button masher. In fact, button mashing is a sin in the world of Prince of Persia. Instead, combat is a rhythmic chaining of combos. You're not meant to be tensed up and leaned forward during battle. You're supposed to be relaxed, absorbing in the environment, the look of the enemy, and the Prince's incredible animations.  There's a fairly deep combo tree in Prince of Persia that can branch off from any of the four buttons (sword, gauntlet, Elika and acrobatics). Discovering how to keep a combo branch from closing allows you to string together a dozen hits for an amazing attack sequence. All combat is one-on-one (or one-on-two if you count Elika) allowing Ubisoft to manipulate the camera freely for a more cinematic experience. And just because you are only battling a single enemy, don't expect combat to be easy. The AI is tough and adapts to your play. Do well and the AI blocks more often and becomes more aggressive. Get your butt handed to you too often and the AI eases up. There's no way to individually manage this (no difficulty setting or other options), but I found the combat most rewarding when the AI was taking it to me.    The only trouble with facing the harder AI is that they more readily engage in quick-time-event attacks. These cut-scene attacks stutter the flow of combat when you get three or four in a row. And since each enemy only has three or four types of attacks, it quickly begins to feel repetitive; especially when you consider that you will fight each boss five or six times. I enjoyed the progression of the bosses, how they become more difficult with each battle and how the arenas themselves made each combat feel a little different, but the QTE moments start coming far too often.  Getting the flow of combat is more difficult than getting into the acrobatics. It's going to be difficult -- perhaps even impossible -- for some to break their old habits. For those who can't get into POP's flow, the experience may be short-lived. Prince of Persia isn't for everyone. You are either going to love it or just not get it at all. If you can embrace the idea that this is more about an experience than about the traditional \"beating the game\" mentality, then you are in for something special.  If the combat or acrobatics prove a challenge, don't worry. You can't die. At all. Ever. Elika will always save you. If you fall, she'll grab your hand and pull you back to safety, depositing you at the last solid ground you were on. If you're going to get squashed by an enemy, Elika will yank you to safety. This gives the enemy a chance to heal, but it keeps the combat moving. This steals some of the challenge from Prince of Persia, but it also offers some freedom for exploration. You can make leaps of faith in an attempt to get at a Light Seed knowing that failing won't penalize you.  I'm okay with removing any serious penalties from a game like Prince. After all, the more you stress about death, the harder it would be to enjoy the scenery. But I do hold issue with some of the other ways Ubisoft has made Prince consumer friendly. When you need to double jump, the color bleeds out of the world. When an enemy is about to counter attack, the block button flashes on screen. There's no way to remove these prompts for those who want to add some challenge. At times, Prince feels a bit like Mister Toad's Wild Ride. Sure, you have your hands on the steering wheel, but you're being guided along. I'm all for making things accessible to a broader audience, but there's no reason Ubisoft couldn't also service the hardcore gamer at the same time.   Perhaps the most challenging moments in Prince are when Elika uses her powers. There are four magic abilities to unlock, each tied to magic plates found throughout the world. Two of the powers are almost identical and offer no skill challenge at all. The red plate rebounds you forward -- often to another red plate) and the blue plates have Elika sling the Prince forward. Different animation, same idea. The other two powers do require some skill and are used for some of the longer sequences in Prince of Persia.  The dash power sends the Prince running up walls. Though you're on a track, you will need to move left and right to dodge obstacles and corruption traps. It's simple gameplay, but these sequences can be several minutes long and failing means starting back from the beginning. The flight power follows the same principal, only Elika takes the Prince in the air. You must dodge left, right, up and down as you soar through the air.  For all its creative juice POP comes up a tad short on the magic elements. Dash and flight are really the same thing, but with one on the ground and the other in the air. And the other powers are identical in every aspect but the animation. I would have liked to see a bit more variety here, especially since the magic plates take a prominent role the deeper you get into the Prince's world.  Fans of the POP franchise know that there's a third element to compliment platforming and combat. There are indeed a handful of puzzle elements in Prince of Persia. The majority of these are very minor things -- mostly moving plates to redirect where you can run. There are only two truly Prince-worthy puzzles. One has you changing the flow of a river of corruption so you can reach a new area, the other has you manipulating some gates to reveal a series of magic plates. It would have been nice to have more puzzles or more ways to alter pathways up walls, but it's nice to at least have something. Certainly puzzles have been downgraded in the new POP, but not completely forgotten.    Prince of Persia can best be described as an open-world platformer with boss battles. It's clearly been influenced by Shadow of the Colossus. Within an hour of starting up a game, you'll be able to run from one end of the world to the other, examining the four very different locations. You won't, however, be able to cure every area right off the bat. Each of the four areas is comprised of six sections (or levels) all of which can be explored from the periphery. But to give players a sense of progression, the majority of these sections can only be cured after obtaining a specific magic power for Elika.  You do, however, get to choose the order in which you unlock Elika's four powers. And the order in which you heal the various locales has a direct affect on gameplay. Each area has its own boss, whom you will face off against repeatedly as you slowly work to heal every section of the land they protect. And each boss has a unique corruption trap to release into the world. The Warrior creates columns of corruption that shoot out from walls and grab at the Prince; the Concubine releases bat-like creatures that chase after the Prince, forcing him forward. Even after beating a boss, the trap sent into the world remains in all of the other corrupted areas.  These traps stack, meaning that in the final levels, you'll be dealing with all four traps layered on top of one another. This dynamically changes the acrobatic challenges in each area. Ascending up the spiraling tower to the top of the Royal Palace when no traps have been released is quite a different experience than doing so with bats chasing you as corruption tremors roll up and down the wall and columns of black goo reach for your heels as you leap to the next ledge.  I was a bit skeptical that just tossing in a trap to an area could make it feel different, but it really does. Mind you, even with four traps released in the world, the difficulty of Prince of Persia doesn't dramatically elevate. Because many of the runs from one section of stable ground to the next offer few moments to stop, the traps are often solved by having good timing at the outset. Get off on the right foot and you will almost never have an issue with the subsequent traps on the run. Ubisoft did a great job of giving a sense of urgency with the traps \u2013 it always feels like you just barely avoided being nabbed by a column of corruption \u2013 but the danger is often an illusion.   When moving through corrupted areas, you may feel funneled into a certain direction, repeating similar sequences, but even then there's something fulfilling about making those jumps. After reaching the healing ground, Elika can rid that section of the world of corruption. The corruption is pushed away, replaced by lush grass, dandelions and butterflies. The sickly area you just ran through is now transformed. Walls of corruption that prevented further exploration have evaporated. And this is where Prince of Persia stands out from other games.  Often the \"healed\" areas of are pretty boring to travel through. It's often a necessary evil of poor design to backtrack through a completed level. But there's a reason to explore the healed areas of Prince of Persia. After healing a level, 45 Light Seeds appear. These seeds are used to unlock new magic powers for Elika. The majority of these luminous orbs can be gathered just by traveling back through the area. However, those looking to gather all 1001 Light Seeds will have to search every nook and cranny of the world. The payoff for doing so is unlockable skins, which can be used to put the Prince and Elika in different looks. But the bigger reward is seeing the game world.  As pretty as the world of Prince might be when covered in corruption, it's absolutely magical when healed. There are moments when I felt like I was running through a watercolor painting. The four areas of Prince are wholly unique in look and each manages to find the perfect balance between fantasy and reality. If you don't take some time out of your quest to stand on a plateau to admire the vista, you're missing out on POP's greatest gift.    The visuals aren't superficial. There's a story for every single area you visit. Elika's people abandoned this world long before Ahriman was freed and you can learn more of the history by speaking to Elika. There's a talk button, which you can use anytime you're stopped (or to talk smack to enemies). This adds optional conversations which give you more insight into Elika, the Prince, the bosses you're battling and the lands you're healing. Some of the conversations are seemingly trivial, but showcase the Prince's piss-poor personality (must he always be such a jerk?) and Elika's charm. The Prince is a bit too acerbic for my tastes and some of his lines are groan-worthy. But Elika and the bosses are well-voiced and make up for the Prince's deficiencies. "

There's no way to individually manage this (no difficulty setting or other options), but I found the combat most rewarding when the AI was taking it to me.    The only trouble with facing the harder AI is that they more readily engage in quick-time-event attacks. These cut-scene attacks stutter the flow of combat when you get three or four in a row. And since each enemy only has three or four types of attacks, it quickly begins to feel repetitive; especially when you consider that you will fight each boss five or six times. I enjoyed the progression of the bosses, how they become more difficult with each battle and how the arenas themselves made each combat feel a little different, but the QTE moments start coming far too often.  Getting the flow of combat is more difficult than getting into the acrobatics. It's going to be difficult -- perhaps even impossible -- for some to break their old habits. For those who can't get into POP's flow, the experience may be short-lived. Prince of Persia isn't for everyone. You are either going to love it or just not get it at all. If you can embrace the idea that this is more about an experience than about the traditional \"beating the game\" mentality, then you are in for something special.  If the combat or acrobatics prove a challenge, don't worry. You can't die. At all. Ever. Elika will always save you. If you fall, she'll grab your hand and pull you back to safety, depositing you at the last solid ground you were on. If you're going to get squashed by an enemy, Elika will yank you to safety. This gives the enemy a chance to heal, but it keeps the combat moving. This steals some of the challenge from Prince of Persia, but it also offers some freedom for exploration. You can make leaps of faith in an attempt to get at a Light Seed knowing that failing won't penalize you.  I'm okay with removing any serious penalties from a game like Prince. After all, the more you stress about death, the harder it would be to enjoy the scenery. But I do hold issue with some of the other ways Ubisoft has made Prince consumer friendly. When you need to double jump, the color bleeds out of the world. When an enemy is about to counter attack, the block button flashes on screen. There's no way to remove these prompts for those who want to add some challenge. At times, Prince feels a bit like Mister Toad's Wild Ride. Sure, you have your hands on the steering wheel, but you're being guided along. I'm all for making things accessible to a broader audience, but there's no reason Ubisoft couldn't also service the hardcore gamer at the same time.   Perhaps the most challenging moments in Prince are when Elika uses her powers. There are four magic abilities to unlock, each tied to magic plates found throughout the world. Two of the powers are almost identical and offer no skill challenge at all. The red plate rebounds you forward -- often to another red plate) and the blue plates have Elika sling the Prince forward. Different animation, same idea. The other two powers do require some skill and are used for some of the longer sequences in Prince of Persia.  The dash power sends the Prince running up walls. Though you're on a track, you will need to move left and right to dodge obstacles and corruption traps. It's simple gameplay, but these sequences can be several minutes long and failing means starting back from the beginning. The flight power follows the same principal, only Elika takes the Prince in the air. You must dodge left, right, up and down as you soar through the air.  For all its creative juice POP comes up a tad short on the magic elements. Dash and flight are really the same thing, but with one on the ground and the other in the air. And the other powers are identical in every aspect but the animation. I would have liked to see a bit more variety here, especially since the magic plates take a prominent role the deeper you get into the Prince's world.  Fans of the POP franchise know that there's a third element to compliment platforming and combat. There are indeed a handful of puzzle elements in Prince of Persia. The majority of these are very minor things -- mostly moving plates to redirect where you can run. There are only two truly Prince-worthy puzzles. One has you changing the flow of a river of corruption so you can reach a new area, the other has you manipulating some gates to reveal a series of magic plates. It would have been nice to have more puzzles or more ways to alter pathways up walls, but it's nice to at least have something. Certainly puzzles have been downgraded in the new POP, but not completely forgotten.    Prince of Persia can best be described as an open-world platformer with boss battles. It's clearly been influenced by Shadow of the Colossus. Within an hour of starting up a game, you'll be able to run from one end of the world to the other, examining the four very different locations. You won't, however, be able to cure every area right off the bat. Each of the four areas is comprised of six sections (or levels) all of which can be explored from the periphery. But to give players a sense of progression, the majority of these sections can only be cured after obtaining a specific magic power for Elika.  You do, however, get to choose the order in which you unlock Elika's four powers. And the order in which you heal the various locales has a direct affect on gameplay. Each area has its own boss, whom you will face off against repeatedly as you slowly work to heal every section of the land they protect. And each boss has a unique corruption trap to release into the world. The Warrior creates columns of corruption that shoot out from walls and grab at the Prince; the Concubine releases bat-like creatures that chase after the Prince, forcing him forward. Even after beating a boss, the trap sent into the world remains in all of the other corrupted areas.  These traps stack, meaning that in the final levels, you'll be dealing with all four traps layered on top of one another. This dynamically changes the acrobatic challenges in each area. Ascending up the spiraling tower to the top of the Royal Palace when no traps have been released is quite a different experience than doing so with bats chasing you as corruption tremors roll up and down the wall and columns of black goo reach for your heels as you leap to the next ledge.  I was a bit skeptical that just tossing in a trap to an area could make it feel different, but it really does. Mind you, even with four traps released in the world, the difficulty of Prince of Persia doesn't dramatically elevate. Because many of the runs from one section of stable ground to the next offer few moments to stop, the traps are often solved by having good timing at the outset. Get off on the right foot and you will almost never have an issue with the subsequent traps on the run. Ubisoft did a great job of giving a sense of urgency with the traps \u2013 it always feels like you just barely avoided being nabbed by a column of corruption \u2013 but the danger is often an illusion.   When moving through corrupted areas, you may feel funneled into a certain direction, repeating similar sequences, but even then there's something fulfilling about making those jumps. After reaching the healing ground, Elika can rid that section of the world of corruption. The corruption is pushed away, replaced by lush grass, dandelions and butterflies. The sickly area you just ran through is now transformed. Walls of corruption that prevented further exploration have evaporated. And this is where Prince of Persia stands out from other games.  Often the \"healed\" areas of are pretty boring to travel through. It's often a necessary evil of poor design to backtrack through a completed level. But there's a reason to explore the healed areas of Prince of Persia. After healing a level, 45 Light Seeds appear. These seeds are used to unlock new magic powers for Elika. The majority of these luminous orbs can be gathered just by traveling back through the area. However, those looking to gather all 1001 Light Seeds will have to search every nook and cranny of the world. The payoff for doing so is unlockable skins, which can be used to put the Prince and Elika in different looks. But the bigger reward is seeing the game world.  As pretty as the world of Prince might be when covered in corruption, it's absolutely magical when healed. There are moments when I felt like I was running through a watercolor painting. The four areas of Prince are wholly unique in look and each manages to find the perfect balance between fantasy and reality. If you don't take some time out of your quest to stand on a plateau to admire the vista, you're missing out on POP's greatest gift.    The visuals aren't superficial. There's a story for every single area you visit. Elika's people abandoned this world long before Ahriman was freed and you can learn more of the history by speaking to Elika. There's a talk button, which you can use anytime you're stopped (or to talk smack to enemies). This adds optional conversations which give you more insight into Elika, the Prince, the bosses you're battling and the lands you're healing. Some of the conversations are seemingly trivial, but showcase the Prince's piss-poor personality (must he always be such a jerk?) and Elika's charm. The Prince is a bit too acerbic for my tastes and some of his lines are groan-worthy. But Elika and the bosses are well-voiced and make up for the Prince's deficiencies. "

        "Content": "Almost nothing moves on the Obra Dinn, but it\u2019s still one of the most lively video game boats I\u2019ve been on. Its crew may be long gone, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from having interesting voices and complex stories to tell -- most of which involve horrific deaths. I\u2019ve never played a game quite like Return of the Obra Dinn, but now that I have, all I want is more.  This investigative story skillfully straddles the line between an adventure game, a puzzle game, and a gruesome, supernatural, Moby Dick-themed version of Guess Who. At its core, it's a detective game, but you\u2019re not out on a mission for justice or vengeance. You\u2019re just an insurance evaluator whose job it is to assess the long-since-done damage of a merchant ship called the Obra Dinn, which has mysteriously reappeared after four years lost at sea.   Thankfully, that job is made a lot easier by a pocket watch that lets you view the exact moment somebody died, frozen in time. When you find a corpse aboard the ship, you can enter its memory and hear what that person heard for a few seconds before their death. Then there\u2019s usually a bang or a crunch (or just one final exhale) and the grizzly moment of their doom snaps into view for you to explore and -- ideally -- piece together exactly what happened.  Return of the Obra Dinn doesn\u2019t feel like the fake investigations of a game like The Witcher 3, instead empowering you to hunt for clues and answers like an actual detective. \u201c  This is Return of the Obra Dinn\u2019s main hook, and it\u2019s one of the coolest mechanics I\u2019ve seen in a long time. It doesn\u2019t feel like the forced, fake investigation of games like The Witcher 3 or Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, instead empowering you to hunt for clues and answers that aren\u2019t so obvious. You won\u2019t find highlighted items or hints here, which makes Return of the Obra Dinn as challenging to take on as it is satisfying to complete.  Your overall goal is to fill out a book with the identities and ultimate fates of all of the Obra Dinn\u2019s 60 passengers. Your book comes with a map of the ship, a manifest of names, and a sketch of everyone onboard, but you don\u2019t start with any clue as to which name goes to which picture -- a daunting, but also extremely rewarding task. You can only figure out who is who by thinking critically and piecing together bits of information as you explore more death memories.  For example, you may hear one character refer to another by name, but it\u2019s rarely that simple. Over the course of the roughly eight hours it took me to fill out my book, I used what accent people had, what type of hat or clothes they were wearing, where they died, the way others addressed them, the tasks they were doing, the people they were friends with, the bed they slept in, how their pictures were drawn, and a billion other little things to make the necessary connections.  14 Return of the Obra Dinn In-Game Screenshots 13 Images  Return of the Obra Dinn doesn\u2019t teach you to use or look for any of that information, but it does do a great job of easing you into its tools and getting you motivated to hunt for the truth. Collecting nuggets of new info reminded me of a point-and-click adventure game, but instead of picking up various items that will inevitably be used in specific situations down the line, I was gathering tidbits about different characters that would hopefully help me solve more fates.  I had only guessed 15 of the 60 fates by the time I unlocked the last memory, but managed to solve the other 45 just by retracing my steps. \u201c  As I unlocked more memories I started recognizing characters all over, giving me a clearer picture of who they were and how they might fit into the larger plot. I was stunned when I unlocked the final memory because I had only correctly identified 15 of the 60 fates by that point. But despite being given no new information, I was able to complete the last 45 just by revisiting memories and looking at events in a new, much more informed light.  I loved hunting for all the stuff I had missed, and I was shocked at just how much there was. Return of the Obra Dinn is so open-ended that it can be hard to understand what exactly you\u2019re looking for at first, but I appreciate that it never felt like it was trying to trick me. That means if you see someone acting like the captain, they are probably the captain, not some seaman there just to throw you off. Honestly, it\u2019s hard enough to fill out the book without any red herrings, which makes correctly putting the pieces together feel fair and well earned.  As those individual fates come together, the strange and enchanting story of what happened to the Obra Dinn comes into light. While there are 10 chapters to the book, you actually start by doing the final one and then jump around as you move backwards from there, and many of them are filled with delightful surprises. You often see the end of an individual scene first, then fill in gaps as you find more bodies -- and I enjoyed that there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s never explicitly explained or linked at all.   Return of the Obra Dinn is susceptible to a bit of brute force guessing here and there, but doing so always felt more tedious than just looking for clues like I was supposed to. Your guesses are only verified when you\u2019ve put three correct fates in at once, preventing you from just trying every combination on a single name until you get it right without leaving you floundering in the dark hoping everything is going okay. It\u2019s just the right amount of feedback.  The voice acting is exceptional, which let me rely on a character's intonation and expression as clues themselves. \u201c  Some of the wording for the fates you choose from can be a little confusing, though. Parsing the difference between someone getting \u201cspeared\u201d and \u201cspiked\u201d took just trying one to sort out, and at first I didn\u2019t realize that \u201cdrowned\u201d and \u201cfell overboard\u201d were two different things. But I really like that there are a wide variety of fates to pick from (many that aren\u2019t used at all), even if that can complicate the very specific answers Return of the Obra Dinn is often looking for.  Confusion is also undoubtedly caused by the art style, which developer Lucas Pope describes as \u201c1-bit.\u201d There are only two colors on screen at any time and you can switch between a variety of pallets based on different classic computers. I really like the distinct and expressive nature of its low detail, \u201cdithered\u201d art style, but it does make everything harder to see. That can frustrate at times in a game about hunting for subtle clues, but I also love the flavor that comes along with it -- it\u2019s not like a magical memory of a death from four years prior would be entirely clear.  That art is also coupled with some fantastic music and sound effects that make the Obra Dinn feel alive and full of character itself. The voice acting, of which there is a surprising amount, is also exceptional. It better be too, because I relied on the intonation, expression, and tone of different characters\u2019 voices to help determine who they were way more than I was expecting. Something as blunt as an accent or as subtle as addressing another character as \u201csir\u201d could help tell me whose fate I was exploring.  Every Color Palette in Return of the Obra Dinn 6 Images  I do wish Return of the Obra Dinn had made it just a little quicker to revisit previous memories, however. Your character moves fairly slow with no option to sprint, and you can only leave each memory by finding and exiting through a magic door, which can get a bit tedious. There\u2019s also a ton of information to remember and sort through here, much of it qualitative and hard to categorize. But given the scope, your book does a remarkably good job of making all of that info digestible.  There are also a couple of tiny technical issues worth mentioning, but they\u2019re far from deal breakers. Return of the Obra Dinn\u2019s native resolution seems to be much smaller than 1080p, and while that doesn\u2019t negatively impact its stylized visuals at all, it did cause my mouse sensitivity to skyrocket. You also can\u2019t use \u2018alt-tab\u2019 to switch windows while it\u2019s running, which made researching 19th-century naval hats online between memories more difficult."

        "Content": "A woman in a striking kimono asks a band of Othardian peasants to prove their loyalty to the Garlean Empire and only one \u2014 citing a need to feed his family \u2014 heeds the call. It turns out to be a greater sacrifice than he imagined. She tosses a baroquely engraved pistol at his feet and commands him to shoot one of his friends. Trembling violently, he complies. But she's not done yet. She then orders him to kill his parents, claiming they drain the empire's resources. He refuses, and her goons cut him down. And as for me? I watch all this from behind a rock. I do nothing. Famous god-slaying hero or no, I know that any immediate revenge would bring down more hells on the sorry lot. It's tragic, but it's also fairly realistic.  Worse things happen in Stormblood , the latest expansion for the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, but cruel moments sculpt the overarching narrative into one of the finest stories of the brutality of war and tyranny since The Witcher 3. It bravely ventures into places where brightly colored fantasy epics like this too often fear to tread, such as sad villages where the locals tremble at the thought of resisting oppressors who've abused them for more than two decades. It shows us traitors who've deluded themselves into believing they're fighting for the same reason as freedom-minded rebels. The basic structure of dungeons, quests, and trials hasn't changed much since 2015's Heavensward expansion, but almost everything about Stormblood is worth experiencing, whether it's the new lands, the two new classes, of the fantastic tale that unfolds over the full span of this war-ridden world.   Here, at last, the story shows us the sandy battlefields of beleaguered Ala Mhigo, which we've never seen since Final Fantasy XIV's 2013 relaunch, even though it's been the subject of frequent name-drops from the cast. The zone bookends the long leveling experience from levels 60 to 70, but in many ways it's a sideshow to the stuffing in between. Stormblood is Final Fantasy XIV's \"Asian\" expansion, and the shift in setting and culture seems to have spurred developer Square Enix to new heights of creativity. I saw the fruits of this creativity in the wild plains of the Azim Steppe, where tribes of Au Ra battled in the Mongolian-inspired Naadam to choose their ruler for the next year. I saw them in the towers and busy markets of the Japanese-inspired port of Kagane, the only port in the country open to foreigners. Again and again Stormblood surprised me with new wonders. \u201c  Again and again Stormblood surprised me with new wonders, whether in haunting erhu music in the Chinese-inspired zone of Yanxia or the phenomenal voice acting and facial animations woven through every cutscene. Once, while watching group of imperial soldiers kick an Ala Mhigan commoner on the ground and spit curses in his face, I found myself looking briefly away as the raw emotion from one of the assailants was almost too much to bear. MMORPGs almost never achieve such emotional intensity.   Sometimes the surprise washes away fairly quickly. Underwater exploration is one of Stormblood's flashy new features, complete with mounts that let you hobnob with the fishes and ninja turtle-like denizens of the deep. It's initially amazing, at least for as long as I can hold my breath here in the real world. All too soon, though, novelty wears off once it's clear that there's no specialized underwater combat and that there\u2019s little more beneath the waves besides skyscraper-sized stalks of seaweed.  I experienced all this as a Samurai, which required leveling 10 more levels up from 50 in order to experience the new content. It was worth it. Along with Red Mage, it's one of the two new jobs for Stormblood for players who've reached level 60 and finished the main scenario quests through Heavensward. (You can bypass all these restrictions with a new, pricey option to immediately level a pre-Stormblood job to 60 for 25 bucks and complete all story quests through Heavensward for another 25 bucks.) Frankly, I love it. The Samurai's the kind of damage-oriented melee class I've always wanted to play in Final Fantasy XIV, even if it's kind of awful in PvP. Not only is the class  ridiculously effective as a damage-dealer in dungeons \u2014 what with its highly dangerous combos and cooldowns \u2014 but it also boasts one of the better job stories. The Red Mage is arguably more popular, with its players highlighting its ability to switch between spellcasting and melee as its chief strength.   The new combat gauges inject some clear meaning into the ability rotations for both classes. All classes have them now, but it's clear that Square Enix spent the bulk of its creative resources on the Samurai and Red Mage. (I found my Monk's gauges rather boring by comparison.)  In the case of the Samurai, perfectly executing three sets of combos lights up three icons on the screen, which then signal that it's time to unleash a devastating single-target attack that chops away huge chunks of enemy health.  Stormblood includes some of FFXIV's best encounters to date. \u201c I especially like the system as it essentially becomes a game in itself, particularly when I'm trying to pull off the combos in the brilliant new dungeons and primal fights where success demands constant complicated dances. They're some of Final Fantasy XIV's best encounters to date, as they shake up the standard formula with elements like a boss that doesn't really attack you but instead requires careful placement and dodging decisions. There's a visually stunning Primal fight with a god who slams a train-sized sword down on the main tank, who must pull off a QTE event while the rest of the group tries to knock the sword off him or her. Elsewhere I ran through a besieged castle while mortars rained down around us and later fought against a gorgeous goddess who tried to tried to smother us with love. Or something like that.   It's the finest execution of the template Square Enix has largely followed to the better for half a decade now. Of course, a little unfortunately, it's still that same template. You'll still eventually find yourself gated out of main scenario quests until you unlock them by leveling up, which generally requires grinding your way through the (thankfully enjoyable) dungeons or by jumping in the PvP battlegrounds (which grant a ton of XP and quite quickly). There's also a mass of sidequests but they're rarely worthy of the time and effort needed to secure their meager rewards. Most of the time they sent me trotting miles across the map only to dig in some dirt or to chat with some chap, and in almost every case these encounters lacked a fraction of the punch of the main story. Along with the underwater content, they're the only elements of Stormblood that ever bored me.  Thankfully they're but small blemishes on a golden package. I say without hesitation that this is one of the finest Final Fantasy games to date. There are deaths here, as Square Enix is careful to drive home the lesson that war is just as much about loss as it is about triumph. There are transformations, particularly in the form of a relatively minor character who believably becomes an inspiring leader. I care about these characters. I felt sympathy for the villains. I admired its notion that a single heroic act could wash away the pain and regret of a lifetime of screw-ups. There's little that's final about this fantasy. It's a tale that will endure."

        "Content": "[Editor's Note: Heads up: the PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight is experiencing major performance issues at launch.]  Arkham Asylum, the first Batman game from Rocksteady Studios, had the sense of a fresh beginning for superhero action games. Batman: Arkham Knight has a sense of finality. It builds on the revolutionary strike-and-counter fighting style with powerful new moves  and enemies; it expands on Arkham City\u2019s open world with a larger, more detailed version of Gotham; it introduces a new fully playable Batmobile and makes it an important part of the action and puzzles; and it brings all of Batman\u2019s closest family of Gotham superheroes and rogues together for an amazing, great-looking finale. Roughly 12 hours\u2019 worth of story missions do a great job of playing up the long history between Batman, the three Robins, and Jim and Barbara Gordon. The plot does stray a little too far into the supernatural for my tastes -- in that I generally find the Dark Knight at his finest when the threats he faces are at least remotely grounded in reality -- but in doing so it drives wedges between allies and delves into Batman\u2019s psyche in an interesting way. While the mystery of the identity of the Arkham Knight (a militarized anti-Batman who serves as co-antagonist along with the Scarecrow) fizzles out, there are other surprises to fall back on that kept me engaged in the twisting story. Plus, several strong performances gave it personality: the unsettling monotone voice of John Noble makes this the eeriest version of the Scarecrow yet, Mark Hamill returns for some excellent, darkly hilarious posthumous Joker lines and reenactments of some of the most famous scenes from the comics, and of course the definitive Kevin Conroy stars as Batman. Here and there a few cheesy, wooden lines pop up, mostly in the side quests, but the same is true of nearly any game of this size. And its size is significant. We\u2019re now free to explore three islands of the dark and intermittently stormy Gotham City, which is given character and color by its many bright neon lights and noticeable landmarks like the Chinatown district, Wayne Tower, and Ace Chemicals. All of which are beautifully detailed, and the lighting effects reflecting off wet streets and capes highlight impressive texture detail. The city has been evacuated again, which conveniently makes it impossible to accidentally or intentionally beat up innocents, but the streets are far livelier than in past games thanks to vastly increased populations of criminals, both on foot and engaging in high-speed pursuits with Gotham Police cars. (The animation you get from countering them when they try to run you down is hilarious.) Notably, we don\u2019t return to the Batcave in Arkham Knight, which is fine by me considering how much time was spent there in the past two Arkham games. With the new moderately large open world comes improved transportation. Not only can you cape-glide much faster thanks to an upgradable grapnel, but we\u2019ve also got the rocket-powered, transforming Batmobile, which is to the streets of Gotham City as the Kool-Aid Man is to brick walls. Nearly everything in your path crumbles in a satisfying way as you chase down criminals, and we get some impressive slow-motion explosions out of the simple vehicular combat. (Remember: Batman doesn\u2019t kill, so we can assume everyone walks away from these fiery wrecks. The same goes for the thugs you run over in the street, who are both hit by a car and electrocuted.) These were the only moments I noticed the framerate dip a little, and it wasn't by much. The Batmobile can also be remote-controlled, which makes it a great addition to Batman\u2019s environmental puzzle-solving toolbox. Need to be in two places at once to trigger two switches, or to sneak up on enemies who\u2019ve got you cornered? No problem. And it can be summoned almost anywhere outside, leading to a fantastic move where Batman dives in as it zooms to him. The twist is that when you hold the left trigger, the Batmobile swiftly turns into a slower but highly maneuverable tank that you use to blow up battle drones. That\u2019s... weird. On one hand, this is about as un-Batman an activity as I can imagine. He\u2019s a hero known for using his fists, his non-lethal gadgets, and his wits to defeat criminals because his parents were murdered by a gun, and yet here he is, a knight in futuristic armor blasting away with guns galore. (They automatically switch to non-lethal ammo when targeting humans.) Rocksteady\u2019s obviously aware of this, since more than one character comments on how it\u2019s not exactly his style. On the other hand, tank battles are good fun -- the idea of having hostile drones project a visible line of fire where they\u2019re about to launch a shell gives you awareness of enemies attacking from all sides and lets you avoid them, and it gets tough when heavy and flying drones are introduced and you\u2019re given secondary weapons, such as EMPs and missile barrages, to counter them. True, tank battles are nowhere near as interesting or replayable as the improved brawling and predator-style fights, but adding this third mode of combat to Batman\u2019s repertoire does great things for pacing and variety, ensuring we\u2019re never doing the same thing for long. Tank mode plays a big role in puzzles, too, thanks to a grapnel winch that pulls things down for you. Tank-based platforming puzzles are the one place where the Batmobile feels like a bad idea. They\u2019re only slightly more fun than they sound like, because while it\u2019s maneuverable and can strafe, driving up a narrow ramp is still frustratingly clumsy. Also, take note: both driving and tank combat became much more enjoyable when I switched the controls from the counter-intuitive default scheme to the more natural toggle mode, where you don\u2019t have to hold the tank button down and the left trigger brakes (as every other driving game has taught us it should) instead of transforms. Find that in the Game Options menu, and thank me later. [Edit: Note that you have to reach the GCPD garage before you can enable this option. For some reason it doesn't show up at all until then.] Meanwhile, Batman\u2019s signature strike-and-counter brawling and stealthy predator fights feel better and smoother than ever, and of course they\u2019ve been upgraded with dozens of powerful and interesting new mechanics and subtle tweaks that give us more to experiment with and master. Some of the new moves feel overpowered at first. In brawls you can pick up a dropped baseball bat or club, which gives you a few seconds\u2019 worth of bashing through shielded or shock-baton-wielding enemies, and in predator fights the surprise multi-takedown move that knocks out up to five unsuspecting targets at once and the voice synthesizer gadget that can lure thugs into traps in predator fights both chew through thugs very quickly. But the increased number of enemies in play and new types, like the huge gatling-gun brutes and a medic who can protect his allies with electric fields (which must be shorted out with the Bat Claw before you can hit them) and revive anybody you\u2019ve already knocked out, balance it out well. Also, being hunted by thugs who use denial tactics like firebombing ground vents, controlling hovering drones, deploying landmines, and detecting you if you use Detective Vision for too long made me change up my habits and targeting priorities. A few flashy fight scenarios in the campaign and side missions let you team up with an AI-controlled Robin, Nightwing, or Catwoman, and use them to execute some awesome dual-takedown moves that knock out any enemy instantly and temporarily swap you to control of your partner (while maintaining your combo count). It doesn\u2019t add much mechanically, but fighting side-by-side with a sidekick is a very Batman thing to do. These climactic showpiece fights let Arkham Knight get away with almost entirely dropping the gimmicky boss fights that ended up as low points of previous Arkham games. In a way it\u2019s a let down that there\u2019s no direct physical confrontation with most arch criminals, but nothing is sometimes better than something annoying. The campaign is complemented by a ton of mostly excellent side quests built around stopping villains like Two Face, Penguin, and of course The Riddler. Each mission series has its own gameplay style -- Riddler, for instance, has a mix of his typical riddles and novel Batmobile race courses where you have to speed through while tapping a button to extend or retract pieces of track or obstructions moments before you plunge to your doom or crash and explode; Two-Face\u2019s crew robs banks, putting a timed twist on predator fights; Man-Bat requires listening for his echolocation screams and then performing aerial takedowns. Some -- namely the Arkham Knight\u2019s mercenaries who generally require beatings -- get a bit too repetitive if done one after the other, but mixing things up and doing missions as you find them is worth easily another dozen hours of variety-packed gameplay. And that\u2019s before you even get to the addictive challenge fights -- which include racing and tank battles -- and a New Game +."

        "Subtitle": "The pieces are moving",
        "Content": "The Wolf Among Us Episode 3, titled A Crooked Mile, zooms the camera out and provides some of the most meaty, memorable moments of the series to date. Nearly every scene succeeds at introducing new characters I wanted to know more about, or fleshing out those who've only skirted the edges of the story in the past two episodes. And by providing enough tough decisions with legitimate consequences, A Crooked Mile has made Wolf Among Us feel more like my own authored story than ever before.  My main gripe with Episode 2 was that it didn't feel like Telltale moved the major plot forward all that much. Well, I'm happy to report that A Crooked Mile makes every second of Bigby's 90-minute story count. Entering the apartment of an ancient witch and meeting the one person in Fabletown who still clings to the old world brought a really powerful sense of magic to the story.  Equally affecting was watching over a funeral attended by a large portion of the previous episodes' cast. While finding out how everyone from Snow to Grendel deals with death was touching, being able to dictate how Bigby dealt with it was even better. And then there was the slow reveal of just what kind of a man, mayor, and boss Crane really is. All of these scenes built towards fleshing out the citizens of Fabeltown in some really great, surprising ways.  Without going into spoilers, this episode culminates with one of the strongest scenes Telltale's ever created. Watching Bigby finally bare his fangs against a new adversary dwarfs anything we've seen before I love that I was given incredible power, only to have it stripped away moments later, and it makes the wait for Episode 4 that much longer.  Of course, you're still roleplaying as Bigby throughout all of this, and in my version of the story, his sadness and frustration is really starting to take center stage. I love that even though I keep trying to do what I consider to be \"the right\" thing, I can't help but push those I care about farther and farther away. Even Snow, the one person I hoped would stick by me through thick and thin, seems to be repulsed at the sight of me, and it feels like I\u2019m the one who made that happen. Seeing the prompt that a character \"will remember that\" lingers with me now more than ever.  Time is limited in A Crooked Mile, and always moving forward, so you can't see everything or meet everyone. Conversely, one big change from episodes 1 and 2 is that Telltale seems to give you more time to react to a conversation, which is great because there are some brutally tough decisions to be made. The narrative crossroads throughout Episode 3 are more important than ever thanks to the fact that you can, and will, completely miss certain areas and scenes if you only play through once. That all being said, one gripe I have with Episode 3 is that two different scenes ended before I had a chance to fully explore their settings. Both had rooms full of items to discover, but the moment I hit that one trigger, I was whisked away to the next scene. It's a testament to Wolf's writing and world-building that not being able to explore every nook and cranny in a single playthrough was a legitimate disappointment.",

        "Content": "Once every few hundred years, the Darkspawn Blight comes to the fair lands of Ferelden. Agents of darkness, bringers of evil, these unholy creatures cut great swathes of pain across the earth. They are led by the Archdemon, an ancient beast of immense power, and they would surely destroy us all if it were not for the stalwart courage of the Grey Wardens. They alone stand against the horrors of the Blight, forever our vigilant guardians, protecting us from harm. They perform their duty without thanks, for lately, there is none to give. Ferelden is split, torn asunder from the highest castle of a Noble Lord to the darkest corner of a Dwarven mineshaft.  These are dark times. Against the backdrop of backstabbing politics, racial unrest and the shadow of civil war, the remaining few of the Grey Wardens have begun to hear rumours of Darkspawn movements. Their worst fear is about to come true: the Archdemon is on the move once again. Only a unified force will be able to fight this coming Blight. In Ferelden, unity is a dirty word.  Things are about to get a little messy.   While the fighting is thoughtful, it can also be frenetic.  And so the stage is set for Bioware's latest opus. It's a story of corruption on every level and the fight to regain some sense of balance to stem the tide, which at times seems all but overpowering. Much has been made of the supposed \"maturity\" in the run-up to the game, but all that Marilyn Manson nonsense can be forgotten as it is abundantly clear from the moment it begins that Bioware is telling a tale head and shoulders above the competition. Dragon Age: Origins is deep, complex, and mighty.  The first step to exploring this vast world is the ever-daunting process of creating your character. Coming up with the hero you'll be staring at the rear of for upwards of seventy hours is a daunting task which is made ever more difficult by Origin's entire reason for existing: that of the origin stories. Between a choice of Human, Elf or Dwarf there are six origins to choose from and each represent a couple of hours of absolutely unique play at the start of the game.  They teach you the basics \u2013 movement, combat, dialogue and inventory management - but the events that happen within couldn't be more dissimilar. We suggest playing them all; each one is practically an entire game by itself. There is one constant, however. Whichever one you pick leads to a dramatic story about how your unassuming character is thrust into the ranks of the Grey Wardens with the fate of the world inevitably resting on their shoulders.  Incidentally, that figure of seventy-odd hours is due to us sniffing out most of the side-quests we could, although even then there's a feeling we've missed out on so much. Added with the other Origins, happily bump that up to 80 and beyond, not beginning to count the inevitable deluge of fan-made content that the mod-creation tools will surely provide.   Archer, mage and swordsmen - every taste has been catered for with a delicate touch.  If ever a game supported repeated playthroughs, Origins is it. Your origin story colours the experience of the entire game \u2013 and no superlatives here, it really does. Whichever one you eventually choose, the world will shape and re-order itself around it, often with a subtlety that belies deeper choice. The kinds of interactions we had with the huge amount of powerfully realised NPCs felt so natural in response to our origin story it felt that the game could not possibly have played out in any other way.  A quick load of another character with a different background shows quickly how masterful Bioware has been in painting a world that reacts sublimely to your choices. These changes can be small, such as in the context of a minor side-quest that can still play out in one of a dozen ways, or it can be huge, impacting shocking twists and changing how events play out across all Ferelden and the varying fates of nigh on all the characters you meet.  The plot changes aren't as simple as \"that guy dies\", either. These interactions are governed by an interestingly-employed moral compass \u2013 or rather, a lack of one. A stark contrast against other RPGs, Origins features no such alignment indicator of good or evil actions, simply throwing you to the wind to work things out yourself. Often there are no such clearly-aligned decisions; just a moment of hand-wringing as you struggle to decide which option presented is the one that hopefully won't backfire too badly.   Bioware's skill with facial animation brings the performances to life. Much of the time the people you meet will play important roles in your quest against the Blight, but they remain distant in attachment compared to the wonderful rag-tag group of adventurers that join you in your quest to unite Ferelden against the Darkspawn. These fellow travellers will join your cause automatically, while others you can find and befriend yourself. Your constant companions, they bicker and fight, joke and flirt for the entire time they're with you.  You should take the time to get to know them; while at first you'll be granted with some stat bonuses and character-specific missions, soon you'll realise they represent something more than a way to simply increase stats \u2013 in this group there exists a bond of friendship and duty that is almost palpable. They are often broken, troubled people with past demons that still torment them \u2013 all equal parts confused, brave, frightened, loving, valiant in their own ways, and above all, human. Well, apart from the non-human ones anyway. And after all that, they will follow under your leadership as a Grey Warden into battle and glory.    Naturally, a huge part of the game is the combat, which is handled as ever by off-screen dice rolls, measuring the chance of a successful attack against any defences the enemy might have. Attacking, then, is as simple as right-clicking on an enemy and watching your band of heroes run off to thrash it. Coupled with a versatile tactics screen that allows you to configure the automated combat A.I. of the squad to unending complexity, battles feel more like conducting the bedlam from above than gripping the weight of the blade yourself.  It's a joy to behold - battle animations are performed with flair, all swinging blades and pirouetting whirlwinds of death. The two-handed weapons have particular weight, massive man-sized Swords of Doom that swing laboriously through the air, coming down on hapless, gibbering foes with the crushing finality of a collapsing house. Not that they take centre stage - there are three melee combat styles to invest in, as well as a dizzying array of magical spells.  Combat styles are dual-wielding for slicey-dicey, a sword and a shield for stabby-bashy and the aforementioned Bastard Swords. There's some variety in how you approach each one, usually a trade off between finesse and power, and happily there's an entire branch of skill-tree unlocks based around thumping someone in the face with a shield, which never, ever gets old. There's also archery if you enjoy making your enemies resemble one of auntie's more cadaverous pincushions. Four unique class specialisations for each of the three core classes further increase complexity, giving party members a diversity of different roles.   Some may scoff at another game with sorcerers and swordplay, but this world has been conjured with care.  Still, no matter the armaments, tactics play the biggest part in combat. You can have the biggest, baddest, unique-armour clad nutcases ever to accept missions from people wearing exclamation marks, but if you don't lead them into battle with any kind of plan they will perish with depressing ease. This doesn't mean that the game is hard, however - think of the combat as a kind of angry man's chess, a puzzle to be figured out with wit and cunning as much as fireballs and +7 swords. If things become too much, a quick escape to the options menu can dynamically change the difficulty, but be warned that Origins remains a challenging game.  The kind of tactics you deploy depend entirely on the members of your chosen party.  Three companions at a time is the maximum in these adventures, having to return to base camp if one wishes to mix up the selection. It makes for some chin-rubbing thought as you anticipate the coming battles - will you take the Berserker who's smashing against golems, or the Assassin for sneaky attacks? The warrior mage or the spirit healer? A balanced squad is the key to success in many of the engagements, and depending on your choices the core combat can play out in hugely different styles. There are some mainstays - at least one mage at all times seems to be a universal constant - but on the whole there's a breadth of choice in how you approach things.  Boss fights, on the other hand, are a little more chaotic. There's a steady feed of them throughout the campaign, some part of major quest lines and some to be ferreted out with cunning detective work. The bosses in Origins are terrifying - huge, twisted, straight-from-hell beasts that hate you completely and will kill you without a second's hesitation. While you're still trying to cover your mage and bash the enemy with your warriors while archers stand far away, the size of some of them, coupled with their raw power and potential to smite, turn the battles from angry chess to simply hanging onto the horns of a rampaging bull for dear life. They're panicked, glorious messes as you struggle to throw everything you have at them with vain hope before it takes you down. These are some titanic fights.   Composing a rounded squad is one of the game's many pleasures.  To Dragon Age's credit, they remain titanic throughout. When a common problem with RPG progression is the heroes becoming richer than God and twice as powerful, it's a breath of fresh air to see a game that remains steadfastly demanding right the way through the entire campaign. There never comes a point where you can rest easy and casually run into battle without a care - every single fight in this game can kill you if you're not paying attention, no matter your level. But there is still a strong sense of progression.  Origins remains tough because the challenge ups its ante as the campaign unfolds. Enemies level up alongside you, which can be a little absurd if one dwells on it \u2013 a mere Captain of the Guard towards the end turns out to be several magnitudes of order more powerful than the first giant Ogre fought at the beginning, but the trick is that the scale of the battles increase alongside you as well. What starts off as taking down uncoordinated roving bands of blaggards ends up with facing off against entire armies of beastly brethren. And all shall fall at your sword.  Special mention has to be given to the scope of the setting. The whole story is steeped in a grand mythology that already feels as old as the hills. The creation is quietly confident in its treatment of the vast array of differing groups, which are often presented with centuries of backstory. The main delivery of this history is within a comprehensive Codex that slowly drip-feeds information about practically everything in the game, from biographies of trained dogs in warfare to ancient Dwarven art. It builds into an intimidating collection of culture, as well as acting as a handy guide for gameplay tips and subtle quest hints, and it's all written with an eye for detail that engrosses. If, however, pouring over reams of beautifully written folklore isn't your thing, the presence of history past still seeps in with every encounter and even with every time you go for a stroll around one of the intricate locations.   Combat is staple Bioware stuff, informed by offscreen dice rolls, but it's the best iteration yet.  And what of criticism? Well, the loading screens can be a bit long, and most of the conversation animations are reused by a lot of the NPCs. Animation during conversations on the whole is stilted, which would lessen the impact of the voice acting if the quality of it wasn't so fantastic to begin with. Oh, and it would be nice to quick-travel to the map screen without having to trudge your way back to a starting location, but it's clear why this isn't the case \u2013 lots can and does happen on that homeward bound, but we're plain lazy. And that's about all we've got. Simply expect one of the best RPGs you have yet played.  "

        "Content": "Batman: Arkham Asylum redefines superhero games in the same way The Dark Knight set the bar for comic book movies. A bold statement indeed, but one that's justly deserved. Developer Rocksteady has breathed life into the Caped Crusader's universe with aplomb, tackling Gotham and its villainous underbelly with the same fresh - yet faithful - approach Chris Nolan did when rebooting the movie franchise. The result is not only one of the best comic book games ever made, but it's also one of the best games you're likely to play this year.  Much has already been shown in the run-up to Arkham Asylum's release but, while it's enough to whet the appetite, frankly nothing you've seen so far does the game justice. It may sound obvious but Batman is a game that's best experienced by wholly immersing yourself in its world, soaking up Asylum's broody atmosphere and hanging on every twist the story throws at you. It's this immersion, this faithfulness to the original DC comics that really brings the game to life. When you first take control of Batman you really do feel like a master of all martial arts - you're able to take on half a dozen foes and bring them down without breaking sweat, right from the start of the game, and that's exactly as it should be. Similarly, gliding through the rafters and puzzle solving is second nature, again just as it should be if you're filling the boots of Bruce Wayne's alter ego. That's not to say the game is a pushover \u2013 it'll take a steady seven or eight hours to finish the story mode \u2013 but it's more recognition of the praise that deserves to be heaped on the controls, which are intuitive and extremely rewarding.   The freeflow combat system is instinctive and impressive.  Take the opening fight as an example. Confronted by a group of the Joker's henchmen, in order to continue the chase against the clown prince of crime you need to take them down as quickly as possible. Batman has two basic combat moves \u2013 attack and counter-attack \u2013 but these are context-sensitive and his moves change depending on a handful of variables, like his position compared to your opponent and the weapons he's being attacked with. Time your attacks correctly and you're able, with practice, to take down every guy in one long combo, combining punches, kicks and counters without the need to remember complex button combos \u2013 it's simply a case of hitting the two buttons at the right time. Even when you're deep into the game and have unlocked more attacking options, there are still only a couple of simple combos to remember - yet the result is arguably the most fluid, intelligent and downright exciting melee combat system we've seen in a very long time.  Good job too, because while Batman has a reputation for being the world's greatest detective, for much of the opening part of the game he does most of his thinking with his fists. Black Gate thugs come thick and fast, initially attacking in groups but only throwing punches. As Batman ventures deeper into the Asylum some carry weapons - such as knives and stun sticks - and they must be dazed with a flick of the cape before you can take them down. Others carry assault rifles, which they grab from gun cabinets scattered around the asylum, and if you give them the time to take aim you'll regret it - while Batman's armoured body suit is tough, it'll only last a few seconds against such well-armed opposition.   Sometimes it pays to be quiet, especially when the enemy is carrying guns.  Thankfully, the slick combat system helps you react against such threats quickly and easily, with Batman able to flip across the screen to plant a foot in an enemy's face simply by tapping attack and holding in the desired direction. Additionally, by switching to detective mode \u2013 in which Batman's in-cowl computer highlights points of interest and enemies \u2013 you're able to prioritise threats more efficiently, with anyone carrying a weapon marked in red and lesser threats shown in blue. The end result is a combat mechanic that's incredibly instinctive and empowering, even if you're usually lousy at fighting games.  But for all this talk of combat, there's actually much more to Arkham Asylum than face breaking. Stealth is an all-important tool in Batman's repertoire, the Dark Knight crawling through the shadows and along air ducts to get a better angle on his opponents and avoid traps left by Joker. Indeed, for much of the game, Arkham Asylum bears more than a passing resemblance to the Metal Gear Solid series, with Batman the proverbial Solid Snake as he sneaks up behind enemies to execute silent takedowns. Admittedly the stealth element of the game isn't as sophisticated as that seen in Metal Gear or the early Splinter Cell games, with the Caped Crusader able to escape into the darkness simply by grappling up into the rafters. However, it adds a much-welcome change of pace to the action. More importantly, it provides an alternative method of attack as invariably there are different ways to tackle the same situation, whether it's to charge in fists first or quietly stalk the enemy and take them out one by one.   As enemies are taken out, their buddies begin to panic, realising they're being dropped by an unseen enemy. Further buoyed by Joker's jibes, their heart-rates increase and calm patrols are quickly gripped by sheer panic, as thugs group together for protection and scour the shadows for danger. It's enormous fun, freaking Joker's henchmen out, and provides an additional challenge too, because you need to time your attacks with precision in order to pick off individuals when they break away from the group, darting down to deliver the knockout blow and fleeing back into the shadows before you're seen.  At this point it's worth mentioning one of very few gripes we have with the game. For the most part the enemies are relatively intelligent, teaming up to fight Batman as a group with individuals breaking off to pick up weapons before entering the fray once more. However, there were occasions when we were able to take down bad guys in plain view of their buddies, yet we managed to get away without raising suspicion. It was certainly an exception rather than the rule and overall didn't spoil our enjoyment of the game, but it happened on a couple of occasions.   The villains, especially Scarecrow, provide standout moments in the game.  Elsewhere, there's little to find criticism in the game. Rocksteady has struck a superb balance between action and intrigue, with puzzles and set-pieces helping to change the pace of the game. These vary in style and complexity, from breaking through security doors using one of Batman's many gadgets to more involving puzzles, such as tracking down Gordon after he's been kidnapped by Harley Quinn, using the cowl's computer to isolate traces of the commissioner's tobacco in the air. It's clever stuff but, more importantly, always intuitive, which is one of the game's many charms.  However, if we had to choose one part of the game that really impresses, it'd be the villains. From the moment Joker giggles onto the screen you can't help but admire the effort that's gone into getting each and every one spot on. From the voice casting to the character design and animation, Rocksteady deserves to be applauded for capturing the essence of the comic books superbly. The highlight is naturally Mark Hamill's Joker playing off against Batman, voiced by Kevin Conroy, but the recreation of some of Batman's most feared enemies \u2013 from Killer Croc to Bane and Poison Ivy \u2013 are sterling across the board. Special mention must go to Scarecrow though, whose fear gas plays tricks with Batman's mind to create some of the most memorable moments in the game for a long time. It's difficult to describe them without giving too much away, but think Metal Gear's Psycho Mantis crossed with Freddy Krueger and you're along the right lines.   Brute force doesn't always prevail and Batman must use his head to defeat foes too.  Arkham Asylum itself is also a highlight and there's much more than sterile corridors to explore. Indeed, once you reach the hospital grounds, you have much more freedom to explore, which you'll need to do in order to uncover all of the game's secrets. Riddler trophies are hidden throughout, plus there are Riddler challenges \u2013 clues to piece together by finding different locations and objects \u2013 and you'll need to solve them in order to unlock everything the game has to offer. Then there are Batman's gadgets, which you access as you gain more experience from taking out enemies.  What's particularly nice is that anything you unlock in the main game can be carried over into the Challenge modes. Divided into two modes, the aim of the Combat challenges is to take down each wave of enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible, with bonus points awarded for stringing long combos together and not taking a hit. Meanwhile, the aim of the Invisible Predator challenges is to take out enemies quickly, but using silent takedowns to eliminate all threats without being spotted. Your best scores are uploaded to online leaderboards, plus you're able to compare your skills against your mates in your friends list. With 16 to perfect, there're plenty to keep you coming back for weeks."

        "Content": "Spider-Man 2 the videogame will always hold a special place in my heart. After decades of games taking superheroes, assigning their abilities halfhearted meters, and sticking them in beat'em ups, Spider-Man 2 put you behind the web-head's mask and let you loose on an open-world. The game had citizens packing side missions, enemies roaming the city, and more. Of course, it also had a bunch of problems, but it at least gave the world a glimpse of what a superhero game could be. Surely, someone would pick up the idea, polish it, and run with it\u2026 right?  Five years later, Sucker Punch has dusted of that blueprint and improved the hell out of it. Infamous is one of the best offerings on the PlayStation 3 to date.  Come watch the shocking video review.  When you pick up the controller, you'll be dropped into the shoes of Cole. He used to be your everyday bike messenger, but that all ended when he was delivering a package and the thing went off in his hands. The ensuing blast leveled a gigantic portion of the city and left Cole in a coma. When he wakes up, everything is screwed -- there's a plague that's making people sick, the government's quarantined Empire City, gangs have seized control of the three islands that make up the metropolis, and -- most importantly to our tale -- Cole finds that he's been blessed/cursed with electricity-based superpowers. Now that you're in control of a guy who can shoot lightning bolts from his hands, fall from the highest buildings without taking any damage, and throw cars into the air with his trusty shockwave, what are you going to do?  See, Infamous is an open-world game. Once you've gone through the basic tutorial -- typical third-person controls with L1 bringing up your reticle for aiming your R1 lightning bolt and face button specials -- Empire City is yours to do what you want with. You can go out on story missions, take on the random bad guys camped out on rooftops, tackle some side missions, or just run and jump from rooftop to rooftop. Now, as you get going, you'll need to get Empire City up and running again. At the most basic level, this means Cole needs to head into the city's sewers and manually reestablish the connections between transformers (see: he grabs the working electrical box, grabs the one that isn't working, and lets the juice flow through him to get the city back online). When you do this, you'll gain a new superpower so that by the end of the game you'll have access to 16 abilities such as calling down a massive lightning storm that obliterates enemies as well as an electrical shield you can use to block incoming attacks.  Now, the powers are going to get a lot of press leading up to the launch of Infamous, but one of the most endearing things about this game is Empire City itself. You'll only get to see the pre-blast skyline for a second when you start the title, but the post-blast world is one of wonder and heartache. Now, before things went to hell, Cole was a bit of an urban explorer. This means he's got mad skills in terms of his climbing ability. Everything in this city is designed to be scalable. You'll run at a wall, jump and cling to a windowsill, pull yourself up and leap to a pipe, climb to the roof, and run across a power line connecting the rooftop to another structure. Now, this could've easily turned into a frustration-fest if Sucker Punch demanded precision jumps the likes of Lara Croft, but instead it gave Cole the gift of agility and made it so the man knows to grab on to whatever he can. Within seconds of playing, I was pulling off impressive leaps and truly enjoying myself.   Explosions look good but often hurt innocents. As you turn on the power to various sections of the city, the power lines go live and allow you to skate on them while kicking up a wave of juice. Combine that with Cole's later-level ability to glide via Static Chargers, and you've got the ingredients for one of the most original city-traversal mechanics I've ever seen. Seriously, in the beginning of the game I was a bit worried about how long it would take to navigate the islands without the ability to fly or run at super-speed, but once Cole got to the point of sliding around on the train tracks and chaining together power line moves, I was in love.  Beyond the way you actually play in Empire City, the burg blew me away because of how alive it is. Sure, there are bystanders waving their arms to signify side missions, but how many times was I searching for a blast shard only to have someone run up to me and beg me to come heal a friend? Perhaps I'm just a softy, but the man crying in the street lamenting the loss of his wife and the girl repeating over and over again that she was only supposed to be here one day got to me. If you get caught up in how fun it is to zap bad guys and glide around town, it's these moments coupled with the out of control fires and destroyed vehicles that remind you that you're living in a city that has just gone through its darkest hour and doesn't know how to get back on its feet.   With that backdrop, you'll come to understand that Cole is the most important thing in this time of \"What the hell do we do now?\" See, all these people are on their own. The government isn't going to help them, the gangs will kill them as soon as look at them, and the police are all but gone. When you press Start, you have to decide if you're going to save these people or destroy them. As you play, your actions are tracked on a six-part morality gauge. You can go as high as the saint-like rank of Hero or as low as the scum of the earth rank of Infamous. Now, this choice has an affect on your looks -- good Cole has blue lightning and a clean look to him whereas bad Cole packs red lightning, a filthy coat, and ghostly white face -- but it has a bigger effect on Empire City. If you're good, people post posters of you, cheer you in the streets, and clean up the dump the best that they can. If you're evil, people deface posters of you, hurl rocks at you when they see you, and let the city fall deeper and deeper into filth and anarchy. Will you inspire or dominate the masses?  For me, this is one of the keys to Infamous' greatness. When I played as a hero, I went out of my way to help everyone. I healed the sick, saved guys from being lynched, and was thrilled to see people run over and cheer me. When I played the bad guy route, even I was disturbed by the things Cole did. If you didn't know, there's a set of spark-looking things on your HUD. These are power kegs and represent how much juice you have to do special moves. Your regular lightning bolt doesn't deplete this reservoir, but just about everything else does and you'll need to drain juice from light poles and cars to refill the meter (this will also heal you if you don't want to wait for the regeneration to kick in). Thing is, you can also drain humans of their bio-electrical energy. The boost completely refills your meter, but it kills the person you just drained. When you choose to do this on a downed person -- innocent or foe -- you have to tap Square because the victim is fighting to keep your hand off of his or her face. The camera even changes so that you can watch this battle unfold.  Have you ever seen a woman's face as she grimaces and desperately tries to save her own life? It's screwed up, man.  Cole's powers + montage = OMG  When the game gets going, you'll have a trio of \"bosses\" that are standing in Cole's way and threatening the city, but for the most part, you'll be battling the gangs that have each taken over one of the town's islands. The Reapers are a set of former druggies who now rock hoodies and pack machine guns; the Dustmen used to be homeless but now have armored suits made of junk and a knack for creating robotic drones; and the First Sons are the hardest to take out and obsessed with the Ray Sphere, the device that went boom and created the madness in Empire City. While most of these guys will be chumps with weapons, there will be a handful of dudes in each group that are Conduits -- dudes who have gained powers from the blast. The Reaper Conduit can tear apart the ground and send a blast Cole's way, the Dustman Conduit climbs into a mech made of trash that can basically kill you in a couple of hits, and the First Sons Conduit can morph into an energy being and bring the fight to you. There are also a bunch of rocket launcher-packing dudes, invisible foes, and more. This mix keeps it interesting -- especially when the gangs come and battle each other head-to-head -- but I could've gone for a bit more diversity seeing as how you'll only see one squad on any given island.  Choosing your path is linked to both big decisions, called Karma Moments, and small choices you make during missions. In a Karma Moment, a situation is presented, the game pauses, and Cole audibly weighs the pros and cons of each pick -- when a passerby asks for help and offers a reward, Cole can do the right thing and lend a hand or just fry the guy and take the reward without doing the work; when a bunch of food gets dropped in Archer Square, Cole can let the masses get their fair share or zap the people so he and his friends are taken care of; etc. What I dig about the Karma Moments is that most of the time Cole justifies why he'd pick the bad option, which makes it not seem that bad; I mean, why wouldn't you want to zap the police from a crowd of protesters so that you have more people fighting alongside you rather than  having it be one-on-12? Sure, that's the cowardly choice, but at least it makes sense in the story.  Outside of these events, which are littered throughout the story and side missions, your actual actions feed into the morality meter as well. When you see a person writhing around on the sidewalk, you can be good and heal the person with a quick defibrillator burst or you can suck the bio-electricity from the person's body and kill them. That's an extreme example, but the smaller stuff matters, too. When you're out on a mission, the game keeps track of everything you do. When you complete a task, the game freezes and some stats pop up letting you know the task is done, how many experience points you've earned, as well as how your actions have influenced your Karma. See, if you're trying to be a good guy, you can't run and gun it through the game. You need to make sure you're only taking out the bad guys and not beating the hell out of the citizens of Empire City -- the citizens who love to get in your way.  That might sound like an easy enough task, but you have to understand how powerful Cole's powers can get. As you're completing missions and taking out bad guys on the streets, you're earning XP. This can then be exchanged for upgrades to most of your superpowers, some of which have three upgrades of awesomeness. When I maxed out my Shock Grenades as a good guy, the little balls of explosive energy automatically began restraining enemies after hurting them. This was great at banking me XP for the non-lethal takedowns, but when I faced off against a bunch of foes, I peppered the area with Shock Grenades, the first wave tied guys down, and then the second wave killed the bound baddies. This counted as an Execution; it banked me XP, but it also registered as an evil act. Even though I was fighting the good fight and protecting some medical supplies, I ended that mission with negative Karma.   Missions net lots of XP, but just about everything gives you a few points. These Karma Moments are for more than just show. There will be 15 side missions that are only open to good guys and 15 that are only open to bad guys in addition to the game's 70 neutral tasks, there will be moves you can only unlock if you've achieved a certain Karma rank, and these choices are leading you towards one of the game's two endings and giving you a different experience on each playthough. See, Cole has two main people in his life; there's his best friend Zeke and his girlfriend Trish. When the blast happens, everything changes. Trish's sister is killed in the explosion and then she suddenly has to deal with her boyfriend being the cause of it all, and Zeke has to deal with his best friend now having a higher calling. These threads might not standout in most games, but with the way the story and characters are presented in Infamous, you'll find yourself connecting with the themes. Listening to Zeke lament a failed attempt at a relationship and Trish tell Cole that she loves him drives home the bond these people share -- and that only makes the events ahead and Karma choices you have to make that much more meaningful and emotional. Even though I was playing as a good guy my first time through and I knew what choices I had to make, there came a point of no return for one of the characters and even I faltered -- someone who knew he'd be coming back through -- and thought about making the \"bad\" choice because I couldn't let go.  These characters and events are beautifully driven home via cutscenes that play out as moving graphic novels. The images are still but effects happen in and around them. This artwork looks great (although I wish more visual changes were present when you're evil Cole), but they also set up one of the game's few stumbles -- in-game cutscenes. When the in-game model of Cole or Zeke is used for some dialogue, it pales in comparison to the graphic novel stuff. Seeing Zeke robotically wave his arms or Cole stand at attention with his mouth flapping away kind of hurt the experience. Also, even when you're going the goody two shoes route, Cole's voice is always in the gravely range of Solid Snake. It seems like that should've been a bit lighter for a guy who's willing to pose for the occasional passerby's photo.   In similar (albeit rare) ho-hum spots are some visual issues. The only time the game loads is when you start it, which is awesome, but this does lead to some pop-in here and there. It's never anything major, but don't be shocked to see cars sprout up and building textures drop in as you rocket into areas of the city. Also, be aware that the framerate is going to dip now and again (for me, it was while I was riding the rails) and that you might fall through the world every now and again (in 30 hours, it's happened to me once).  Cole for president.  Another one of my few criticisms is that I was aware I was playing a game most of the time. Sounds silly, right? What I mean is that when I played Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid 4, I found myself completely immersed in those worlds. From start to finish, I was that character and I was fighting for my life. For the majority of the time in Infamous, I totally felt like I was Cole; When I made choices, when women cried out that they wanted to have my baby, and so on, I felt like that stuff was happening to me. However, at the end of every mission the game pauses and brings up a stat box to show you the XP you've earned and what moves you pulled off. I like the information, but it kind of slapped me out of the experience. I would've preferred if the \"Mission Complete\" screen was more integrated like Fallout 3. It was just something that didn't mesh with the rest of the title for me.  Still, those super-small issues shouldn't make you doubt buying this game. Beyond the engaging story chockfull of interesting characters, there are a bunch of side projects for you to tackle. An undercover agent has hidden 32 audio recordings throughout the city, 84 districts need to be liberated from gang rule, and there are 350 Blast Shards scattered around Empire City. What I find nifty about all of these collectables is the fact that none of them are hidden from you -- they all show up in some way on your radar. The audio recordings have been left by a man named John. He's on the inside of the First Sons and has left these story-expanding tidbits on satellite dishes all over the place. When you click L3, a circular sonar-like overlay forms around your radar screen and hones in on the location of one of these Dead Drops if you are near it. As you head in that direction, the sonar-pointer gets more and more specific -- it's sort of like a game of \"Warmer\u2026 warmer\u2026 HOT!\" Similarly, when you click in L3, you'll see your radar spring to life with little lightning bolts and blue dots. A blue bolt signifies an object that Cole can use to recharge -- again, this restores life and the energy kegs that are consumed by using his special abilities -- and the dots are Blast Shards. These shards are pieces of metal from the original blast site that are super-charged with Ray Sphere juice. As you collect them, you'll begin earning more power kegs so that you can store more juice.  The final carrot on the end of the Infamous stick? Stunts. When you pause the game, you'll see one of 21 stunts at the bottom of the screen. If you feel like it -- or at least feel like the Trophy -- it'll be your job to pull off each one of these moves that range from crushing an enemy with an object to simultaneously blowing three guys off a roof with the Shockwave to taking out an airborne enemy with a melee attack. Even though the game is telling you how to do the feats, some are pretty challenging; my advice is to try and get them out of the way while you play rather than be foolish and tackle them after you've finished the story.  Yup, like you'd expect, you can keep on playing when Cole's tale is over. You'll keep all the powers and XP you've unlocked and be able to take on the remaining side missions and enemies. If you feel like starting over and playing as the other side of your Karma chameleon, you're welcome to, but you start with a blank slate in terms of unlocked abilities and XP. If you want to have multiple games going, you're welcome to as Infamous supports 10 save slots counting Autosave.  Massive battles are par for the course. "

        "Content": "Grand Theft Auto on a Nintendo console? It's an incongruous mix for sure, Rockstar's controversy baiting seemingly diametrically opposed to the wholesome family appeal that's become Nintendo's stock in trade of late. It's no wonder that it has been five years since the two last paired and the results of that match-up \u2013 2004's Game Boy Advance iteration of the open-world series \u2013 was decidedly patchy. Subsequently, it's no wonder that expectations for Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars have been muted, with the game's initial announcement last year stoking fears of a quick-fire cash in on the runaway success of both Grand Theft Auto IV and the DS machine.  How wrong we all were \u2013 Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is as fine an entry as there's ever been in the series. Expertly straddling GTA's top-down heritage and the high production values of more recent outings, it's a game that celebrates the game's past while acquiring the refinements bought about in the latter 3D incarnations. The resultant mix is one that's likely to feel like manna from heaven for series stalwarts, and for latecomer's it's still one of the most beguiling games the DS has to offer.    Chinatown War's Liberty City is recognisably the same metropolis that framed Niko Bellic's story in GTA IV, though now viewed from a retrograde bird's-eye-view perspective. The grit and grime are obvious points of intersection with GTA IV, while the neon glory of Star Square, the low-down squalor of Broker and the high rise glamour of Algonquin retain their character despite the considerable reduction of resolution. It's all outlined by an impressive level of detail squeezed onto the DS: whether it's the neon under-glow that emanates from the high-end sports cars, the subtle shifting of weather patterns or the news-stands that collapse in a shower of paper when collided with, this is as atmospheric a rendition of urban America as that pulled off in GTA IV. The forced perspective doesn't allow for the digital tourism that helped define GTA IV but nevertheless, Liberty City is still Chinatown War's most engaging character.  But while GTA IV might be the most obvious initial touchstone, Chinatown Wars real influence goes back much further to the series' dawn, and most specifically to GTA2, the 1999 instalment that to this day remains a series highlight for many. It's there superficially in the perspective, a pseudo 2D mode rendered in a robust and at times beautiful game engine. Chinatown Wars feels like GTA IV as witnessed by Claude Speed and if the general aesthetic is borrowed from Niko's adventure then the underlying mechanics are most certainly taken from the GTA of old.  Not that it feels in any way dated \u2013 the meat and bones of gunplay and driving feel as engrossing as ever. Vehicles handle with weight and feel suitably distinct. Take a Stallion to the streets and it's a challenge keeping its rear-end in check; get behind the wheel of an Infernus and it's a feat of considerable concentration, keeping your reflexes in tune with the car's ferocious speed. Navigating the slim streets is made somewhat easier by an optional steering assist that helps stabilise the cars but with or without it the handling's a treat. The vehicle roster goes beyond four wheels as well, taking in bulldozers, bikes, boats, jet-skis and, most pleasingly, tanks.    Yes, tanks. Chinatown Wars marks a return of some of the more eccentric elements of the series that were jettisoned to service IV's more sombre tone: vigilante missions stage a comeback, as do taxi driver missions, ambulance driver missions and rampage missions among others, and when it comes to periphery activities Chinatown Wars easily trumps its high definition cousin. No better is this evident than in the all-new drug-dealing mini-game, which proves to be one of the most compelling aspects of Chinatown Wars. Representing a bustling and very much alive in-game economy, the price of narcotics fluctuates as supply and demand ebbs and flows \u2013 and keeping abreast of the shifting economy to nab a sweet deal is a constantly gratifying pleasure. It's an immense time-sink and one which kept us occupied well beyond of the solo campaign.   The story itself is a solid enough new entry into Grand Theft Auto's expanding world of crime-soaked stories, although the loss of voice acting prevents Chinatown Wars from hitting the dramatic heights the series has recently scaled. There's a maturity to the tale that's unprecedented on the DS, but on the flip side it's maturity of an extremely infantile nature. No opportunity to drop the f-bomb is passed by, while every chance to slip in a cock gag is taken and as a result the characters get lost amidst the excessively crude dialogue. Nevertheless, it's a relatively gripping and well presented story - using lightly animated and heavily stylised cut-scenes, lead character Huang Lee's tale of redemption covers the familiar series tropes, as his story takes him through every facet of Liberty City's criminal underworld.    Likewise, the missions cover familiar ground \u2013 and anyone who still cowers away from GTA's well-worn variations on driving point to point then unleashing hell is unlikely to find solace here. Although there's nothing above and beyond the usual repertoire of action in the mission set, series staples are given an additional flourish by some intelligent implementation of the touch-screen. Astonishingly, the touch-screen mini-games never feel like gimmicks, instead lending the world of car-jacking and safe-smashing an added layer of immersion.  For example, get in a parked car and the bottom screen is handed over to a small mini-game. Lower spec vehicles require simply gaining access to the ignition and hotwiring the car, while more high-spec vehicles have more complicated security systems in place, demanding a little light hacking to get the wheels rolling. Mission objectives often make similarly canny use of the lower screen: constructing a sniper rifle piece by piece, slotting together the muzzle and clip with a satisfying twist, shift and click is one particular pleasure, and it's just one example picked from dozens.    That's not the only clever use made of the hardware, for the game is considerate of the DS and its idiosyncrasies throughout. Missions are predominantly dealt out over email, which are accessible over the PDA that's hosted on the bottom screen. It's here where the map is also situated, which is a beneficiary of the waypoint system first introduced in GTA IV. From here it's also possible to select weapons, and overall the interface is smart and neat \u2013 indeed, the only problem we encountered was one with the DS itself, as never before has that inch of plastic between the two screens made itself feel so present as your eye flits from map to action and back again.

        "Content": "There's no sense in beating around the bush -- Resistance: Retribution is excellent. It's got a main character you'll connect with, an engaging single-player campaign, a crapload of unlockables, PS3 connectivity and the strongest online multiplayer I have ever seen in a PSP game. In short, you're an idiot if you don't buy this game.  Set between Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, Retribution tells the tale of James Grayson . A British Marine, Grayson was doing his part in the fight against the Chimera when he and a pair of soldiers stumbled into the middle of the Chimera conversion process (i.e. a beast turning a human into a monster). The boys took out the overseeing baddie but discovered that the person on his way to becoming the enemy was actually Grayson's brother. Grayson kills his own brother and it basically cripples Grayson's life as he knows it. He goes AWOL from the armed services and sets out on a one-man campaign to blow up every conversion center he can find. After eliminating more than 25 of the enemy bases, the Marines catch up to Grayson. See, while he's become a folk hero to the human race, the Brits aren't too keen on desertion; they arrest, try and sentence Grayson to death. Before he can face the firing squad, the European resistance known as the Maquis pops up to ask for some help delivering a serum that should clear out the Chimera. The Brits agree, release Grayson and the war is back on.  And that's just the opening movie, people.  Video reviews: All the cool Chimera are doing it.  Once you start playing, the story only gets better and it's thanks to the character of James Grayson. From the moment he had to shoot his brother, I was drawn to Grayson. A smartass and a badass, Grayson's that adult character we haven't seen much of on the PSP. He curses, he screws and he's only helping the Maquis and British Marines out because he made a promise to himself to kill every Chimera he possibly could. When Grayson goes out on these missions, the Maquis -- generally headed by the sexy Raine Bouchard -- will talk about its objectives and Grayson kind of just nods along and lets it slide in one ear and out the other. A perfect example is when Grayson and Bouchard head into a conversion center that's unlike the ones our hero has seen before. Bouchard begs him not to blow it up because she wants to study the inside after they've cleared out the Chimera. Grayson tells her what she wants to hear and then blows the center up anyway. These pivotal moments are driven home by Grayson's journal entries before every mission where he explains his motives and actions. This is a three-dimensional character who has lost his only connection to the world and is hell-bent on killing as many Chimera as he can before they kill him. This personality gets fleshed out through the game -- your first playthrough should take you about 10 hours -- and makes you care that much more about the experience.  Taking Grayson through the trials and tribulations of a globe-spanning war is a proven system of control that you'll probably be pretty familiar with if you played the Syphon Filter games. Yes, Sony Bend has brought back the control scheme it pioneered with Gabe Logan, but the studio has also added a number of improvements to make the third-person action even better. In the simplest of terms, the analog nub moves Grayson forward, backward, and side-to-side, while the PSP's face buttons control his point of view. Tapping R fires your weapon, holding L switches to your weapon's secondary fire, and down on the D-Pad will let you hop over/climb things in certain contextual situations. Tapping right on the D-Pad will cycle through your weapons, but holding right will pause the game and bring up your weapon wheel. Here, you can leisurely page through every weapon you have -- you don't ever lose a gun and you'll keep your arsenal from playthrough to playthrough -- and choose which one you're going to battle with.   Bring it on, Titan! Yes, this is all a lot like the last Syphon Filter game -- even the save icon, journals preceding the missions and more are in the Logan's Shadow format -- but there have been tweaks added that make the experience easier to get a handle on. At the top of the list is the game's Aim Assist box. When you're playing, there will be a yellow box on screen that's pretty large. As long as you get the enemy in this box, the crosshairs of your gun will automatically leap to your foe so that you can run and gun without having to awkwardly nudge the crosshairs on top of your target. It's a simple system that makes the game considerably easier and faster, but you can turn it off if you like.  Although cover has always been a big part of Bend's PSP outings, the developer has put an extra layer of polish on Retribution. When you walk up to a doorjamb or box, Grayson will stick to it automatically much like Logan would in the Syphon Filter games, but now there's no blind fire or convoluted process of holding a direction, leaning out and firing. Here, Grayson sticks to the object, you move the crosshairs into position, and tap or hold R to fire. When you stop shooting, Grayson moves back to cover. There's no need to tell him to crouch because he'll understand when he needs to do what and you can hurdle over an object from cover without having to stand up like Logan did.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the Syphon Filter games, but they always felt very robotic in movement -- moving Logan from cover, through an enemy, into lower cover and over an obstacle felt slowly paced and input-heavy. That isn't the case in Retribution. Grayson will fly around levels blasting bad guys and you'll love every second of it.   However, what I will say about Logan's Shadow compared to Retribution is that I remember feeling challenged in the last Syphon Filter. That isn't the case in Resistance. Don't misquote me; there are challenging parts to Retribution and I'm comparing the titles on normal difficulty, but I never really felt like the enemies were offering up that much of a fight in Retribution. Hell, there were times when a Boiler (a Chimeran female whose head explodes if she gets too close to you) would pop up and scare the hell out of me and the final mission has two tunnels that are literally filled with every enemy you've faced and very few health packs, but I always felt like I could get through it with ease. Obviously, you could crank the difficulty up to try and get a better challenge out of the title, but even then it didn't seem like insurmountable odds.  Even weirder can be the feeling that you're entering these really big, important Chimeran facilities, but you're not seeing the same type of resistance you found in the PS3 titles. Yeah, I know the PSP can't handle that many things on screen, but why aren't the Chimera defending these positions better?  James Grayson is an awesome dude.  Still, don't let those minor criticisms scare you off. Resistance: Retribution is a hell of a ride and packs a lot of punch -- especially in the firepower department. There are a dozen weapons in Retribution and each is integral to your survival. My favorite part of the game was one of the most frustrating. Remember that tunnel I was talking about a while ago with every enemy? There wasn't a checkpoint in the middle of that tunnel, so I had to make it from one end of the road to another. This meant that every time a wave of enemies popped up, I'd hold right on the D-Pad and cycle through my arsenal for the right weapon to take out the bad guys. The chaingun and its movable shield was perfect for the massive Titans that stomped down the hall and fired explosive energy blasts, the shotgun was made for taking out Leapers that hatched from gooey eggs and being able to shoot through walls with the Auger made my life so much easier when I was on my last bit of health. Toss in the Razor -- and energy blaster similar to the Bullseye where the secondary fire sends a charged blade that ricochets around cleaning out the bad guys -- and you've got a weapon collection that's fun to use.  I legitimately enjoyed myself the entire way through Retribution; I even found myself doing something I rarely do and that was daydreaming of my second playthrough while I was still in the middle of my first. See, there's a ton of replay value to this title. For every section of a level, there are three Skill Point objectives. These vary between feats such as getting nine headshots with the sniper rifle to killing three Titans with only the rocket launcher to killing a handful of leapers without them attacking your comrade. You play the level, try to hit these \"achievements,\" and if you unlock them all, you get one of six locked files such as movies, music and more. Sadly, you can't check the Skill Point requirements when you're in a level. The only way to scope the requirements is to choose the level after having already played it once; you then have to remember the requirements while you play. Meanwhile, there are 67 pieces of intel hidden throughout the game. If you find all of the pieces in one of the three categories, you'll unlock a weapon assigned to that category. These pieces include the XR-004 Allure, Plasma Grenade, and Longbow 1S-1K. If you unlock everything, you'll get the explosive-shooting magnum.  However, there is a way to get the magnum without unlocking any intel. It's called infecting your PSP and it's pretty awesome. See, Resistance: Retribution and Resistance 2 have this private dance called PSP Connectivity. Basically, you put Resistance 2 in your PS3, go to the options menu and select Connect PSP. From there, you need to have you PSP plugged into the PS3 via the USB cable and Resistance: Retribution's main menu active. You'll have two options on your TV screen -- Infect Resistance: Retribution and Activate Resistance: Retribution Plus.   I hate Boilers. The first one basically changes everything you know about James Grayson. Rather than being a normal human out to fight the Chimera, he'll be infected with the same virus Nathan Hale struggles with on the consoles. Grayson will be able to breathe underwater and regenerate his health meter, but he'll also get a spiffy Spectre suit like Hale's from R2 as well as that sweet magnum I mentioned earlier. Now, this change will only last as long as Retribution is being played after being Infected; that is, if you quit back to the XMB and then restart the game, you're going to have regular ol' James Grayson at your disposal. When I first heard about this Infection angle, the coolest thing to me was that some of the in-game dialogue would change when Grayson's eyes went yellow. In practice, however, the changes are super-minor. The full-on videos still show Grayson in his trademark leather jacket, but then anything using in-game assets will show him in the Spectre suit with just the occasional line of dialogue changed to reflect the infection.  I guess I was expecting more because after doing a straight playthrough of the title, I got to see how cut and dry things are for Grayson when someone's infected. I figured that infecting someone who hated the infected so much would lead to at least one cutscene of him struggling with the idea, but that never happened. Instead some soldier asks why James looks jaunty and our hero nonchalantly tells him that he's infected. It's still cool that they changed the dialogue at all, but I could've gone for more. Thankfully, Grayson looks slick in black and regenerative health will be a lifesaver to anyone struggling with a certain part of the title.  Activating Resistance: Retribution Plus is probably a nifty add-on most have heard about. When you select this option from the R2 menu with Retribution plugged into the PS3, you'll transfer your PS3 controller to the PSP. That's right, you'll be able to control the Retribution action on your PSP via your SixAxis or DualShock 3 (rumble included). The controls carry over pretty much button for button, except that you can now use the second analog stick to control Grayson's POV rather than the PSP's face buttons. The major change, however, is that this method of control eliminates the Aim Assist box you find in the original game. Now that you have complete control, you're on your own to aim. This actually makes the game quite a bit harder. Without the Aim Assist, you now have to line up each shot rather than just getting the giant window around a target. It slows down the action to something more akin to a PS3 third-person shooter.  The switch even eliminates one of my concerns with the original control method -- if you're using the PSP, you can only cycle one way through your weapons; with Retribution Plus, your shoulder buttons allow you to cycle both ways. Personally, I found the default DualShock controls a bit sluggish, but Sony Bend thought that through and movement speeds can be easily adjusted from the options menu. All in all, this is another great addition to the replay value of Retribution -- you figure that this marks a third way that you can play the same single-player campaign.   If you move beyond the stuff you can do solo, you'll find that Resistance: Retribution keeps on giving. Packing both an ad-hoc mode and infrastructure option, Retribution has one of the deepest online communities I have ever seen on the PSP. Infrastructure is set up for eight-player matches (four people as the Cloven and four as the Maquis) in one of five modes. There are clans, voice chat, 12 ranks to achieve, a friends list, unranked matches and more. I mean, there are 22 medals in this online -- each with gold, silver, and bronze rankings -- that are attached to your profile so that voyeurs can see that you've raked in 200 kills with the Storm Rifle or that you've been awarded the \"Helping Hand\" medal for 300 kill assists (quick aside: kill assists rock. After playing a few rounds of R:R, I was getting mad while playing Killzone 2 and not getting credit for helping teammates kill other people).  In short, this is a PS3-like multiplayer experience in the palm of your hand. The gameplay itself works just like it does in the single-player campaign but now you can taunt fallen foes . The taunt you choose is random, but as you rank up from a lowly private, you'll have access to more and more of the library that includes dancing over bodies while a techno beat blares and kicking dirt on downed opponents; there's even a \"Teabagger\" medal to get by taunting. If you come across a downed teammate, you can also use down on the D-Pad to revive the player.  Multiplayer mayhem.  In terms of the five modes, you should be familiar with the majority of them. Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag are self-explanatory, while Free For All is just a regular deathmatch. Still, Assimilation and Containment might require a bit more explanation. Assimilation starts one player as a member of the Cloven and the other players all start as Maquis members. As the Cloven kills people, they are assimilated into the Cloven brood so that the Maquis unit gets smaller and smaller. The twist on this mode is that whichever group has the least amount of people is the more powerful squad. So, when the game begins the single Cloven is going to be able to take more damage and eliminate foes with ease and in the end, the single Maquis will reap these benefits. Meanwhile, in Containment, squads battle to capture and hold coolant nodes for as long as possible.  These modes are simple and familiar to anyone who has played some multiplayer matches in recent memory, but they feel fresh thanks to Retribution's five maps that hearken back to environments from the campaign. When I first played this, I got excited thinking about finally having a super-solid multiplayer community on my PSP, but that feeling waned a bit when I thought about the lackluster amount of WiFi on Bay Area public transportation. If I'm sitting at home, wouldn't I rather play Killzone 2 multiplayer rather than Retribution? Well, the answer is probably yes, but I think Retribution fills another important multiplayer gap in my life -- something cool to play while my wife watches crappy television. I love ranking up and shooting people in the head, and if Katie's watching something I'm not interested, why not do it on my favorite handheld? Retribution has some awesome options -- there are 60 clan patches to choose from, you can leave messages of the day for your clan mates, all the stats can be tracked on MyResistance.net and you can import PSN Friends who have played Retribution -- and the gameplay is great. I can honestly see me playing this.  I can't believe I just said that about online multiplayer on the PSP.  I realize I'm writing a book here, but there's just so much to say about this game. Before I go, I'd be a fool not to mention the music and the graphics. The voices here are great, but the orchestra Sony brought in for the musical score steals the show. When you're in a heated battle -- taking cover behind crates while the gunfire of Hybrids rains down on you and some ugly Boilers shamble toward you -- the music is right there with you perfectly accompanying the moment. You owe it to yourself to play Retribution with headphones. On the other side of the coin, I was never impressed with the graphics. The movies look great, but the in-game stuff only looks good for a PSP game. The characters are more realistic than Syphon Filter, but other than that there isn't much of a jump -- just some new environments and animations.  Oh, I'm going to win! "

        "Content": "Pity the poor flight sim. Once a staple ingredient of any PC gamer's diet, these incredibly complex pieces of software have since become a rare delicacy enjoyed by a hidden audience. Once upon a time every second game on the PC was a flight sim, but their limelight slowly petered out as more accessible genres engulfed the PC. Yet there's still a sizable audience of virtual Mavericks out there, eagerly waiting for the latest virtual cockpit. Sadly though, this large yet quiet audience doesn't justify the development attention it once did, and the result has been a dearth of sims. Simmers have watched in horror as their beloved genre gasped its dying breath over the last few years, with only re-releases of older games, and the promise of a handful of titles, to keep them going. Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark (BS) was one of those titles, and has been in development for what feels like decades.  Built by the same team who released the critically acclaimed Flanker series, and its follow-up, the gorgeous but not so well received Lock On Modern Air Combat, BS has pedigree simming DNA. These crazy Russians \u2013 now known as Eagle Dynamics \u2013 have been guided by an ex Ubi-producer to go it alone for this title, releasing it online via their site for US$49.99. Once you've read the review, you can pop over here to purchase it if the score to your right gets your joystick all tingly. And yes, that price stays the same regardless of which region you purchase it from, unlike certain other digital distribution services.   The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.  Enough about the genre and the developer though, let's dig into Black Shark, the finest flight simulator to hit the PC since IL2 graced our screens back in 2001. Dammit, I've already given away how amazing this game is. Black Shark's like that though \u2013 it's one of a select few games that make lovers of aviation blabber on to the closest poor soul about how cool it is that somebody has modelled the vortex ring state in a chopper sim.  So, the Black Shark. Otherwise known as the KA-50, it's an odd looking attack chopper by Western standards. It doesn't have the usual tail rotor thanks to its contra-rotating dual rotors on top. It's a single-seater, and has an odd mixture of analogue and digital controls. Deadly by day, but crippled at night, she's a hard bird to tame thanks to the quirks of helicopter flight. And it's the only chopper you'll fly in this game, as BS is what is known as a study sim. Unlike titles such as IL2 and LOMAC, where there's a whole airport worth of aircraft to fly, BS sticks to one aircraft, but models it to exacting detail. The 380 page manual is evidence of just how much info the developers got when they worked with Kamov (the makers of the real chopper).  Like the magnificent Falcon 4, the KA-50 in this game has a fully clickable pit. Nearly every single one of the hundreds of switches in the cockpit actually works. Simply starting the engines and taking off takes 51 different switches and buttons. The ABRIS computer within the cockpit even goes through a full boot up process when you switch it on (according to the BIOS boot screen it's powered by a DX4 CPU and 2GB of RAM \u2013 this is 90s technology at its best). Blades ice up if you forget to turn the deicing on at high altitude; blades come into crunching contact if you flail about at high speed.   Landlubbers off the starboard bow cap'n! Oh, is that not helicopter lingo? Ah. Sorry.  Mastering all of these systems is one thing, but then there's the complexity of what is quite possibly the finest flight model we've ever piloted. Both Flanker, and the LOMAC expansion Flaming Cliffs, were known for their impressive ability to recreate the way a plane handles, taking the airborne rollercoasters seen in other sims off their virtual rails. Black Shark goes one further, modelling precisely how these birds handle. We should know, as we took our first chopper lesson a month before buying the game. But if you don't believe us, the dozens of real life pilots on the official forums, all singing praise for how accurately this virtual KA-50 handles, should convince you.  Combine the dozens of different systems with this amazing flight model, and you end up with one incredibly hard game. It makes Eve Online's economy look shallow by comparison. And that's the point of this game. The more you put into it, the more satisfaction there is when all of these complex systems come together to turn that enemy tank into a smoking pile of slag and meat. There are options to set the game up in easy mode for novice flyers, but you're missing out on 90% of the fun if you fly it that way. And if you want an arcade sim, BS can't compete with the graphical delights of the likes of Ace Combat.   It might not be quite up there with Ace Combat in the visual stakes, but looking at the screenshots, you can see just how beautifully the KA-50 has been modelled. Everything down to the last rivet is in place, and the damage effects are equally impressive. The gorgeous visuals don't stop with the chopper though. Considering the view distance is in the hundreds of kilometres, the terrain detail is meticulous. Forests and mountains are stunning, though cities could still do with some work, especially considering how much performance they zap from this CPU-bottlenecked game. Sadly most trees don't have a collision map, so you can fly right through 'em Slimer style, but it's a performance trade-off you'll soon come to accept. Ground and air units, both friendly and the unkind type, are generally stunningly rendered, though there are still a few nasty leftovers from this game's LOMAC origins.  Overall it's a very pretty picture, and thankfully running these stunning visuals are nowhere near as demanding as this game's LOMAC predecessor. We averaged a frame rate of around 35 to 50 fps using a Core2 Duo processor overclocked to 4GHz, 4GB of RAM, an 8800GTX and Vista 64-bit edition. In extremely busy scenes, it would dip to 19fps or so, adequate for the slower pace of a sim. Note that this game is a CPU pig, and also gets a sizable performance increase when the combination of Vista and dual cores is applied. Ok, so our system isn't exactly a slouch, but LOMAC ran like a pig on high end systems of its time. A 3GHz CPU, 2GB of RAM and a mid-level graphics card should give you more than playable performance.   Hey, can we play SpaceWar on this thing?  Considering the campaign has a hell of a lot more going on in it than LOMAC, this smooth performance is no mean feat. Unlike the sterile \u2013face it, tedious \u2013 campaign of LOMAC and IL2, BS has two epic yet linear campaigns which are a perfect blend of action, set pieces, variety and random elements. Thanks to the inclusion of new random triggers in the mission editor, there's always a random element to how a mission will play out, so even though it's fairly linear, you'll still be surprised every now and then. The mission editor has been given a huge overhaul and given its own 180 page manual. We're pretty sure the thriving community will have delivered many more campaigns by the time we beat the one included with the game sometime in a few months.  UPDATE: since posting this review, the game's producer dropped us a friendly note to let us know that the campaign isn't as linear as we'd thought. Depending on how you go in a mission, you can be served up one of four different follow-up missions, each of which has random variables. So once you've completed the campaign, you'll be able to play through it many times and not have the same mission set twice. Nice.  Though we've only played online as two player co-op, we're happy to report that it was a flawless experience with very little lag and no crashes. Taking almost three hours to finish a single mission, the handful of missions included will give you and a buddy at least ten hours of fun, but there are already stacks of co-op missions available online. Having said that, it would have been amazing if the campaign was fully co-op compatible, but it seems that a patch is in the works which will make it easy to convert the single player one into one.  If there is one issue with BS, it's that old simming bug bear, AI. Unfortunately the AI of the game hasn't advanced as far as the other systems. In the case of ground units, it's very predictable, tending to drive in straight lines, if it takes evasive action at all. In the case of friendly wingmen, it can be idiotically stupid. Generally your wingmen will manage to stay alive, but far too often they'll zoom into the hot zone to attack rather than deploying weapons from stand-off range. Having said that, we're only a month into playing this game, so perhaps there are intricacies to the datalink system and radio commands which can change all that. DCS is the kind of game that takes years, rather than months, to master.   Black Shark, eh? Quite an evocative name. Certainly better than the Tawny Labradoodle, which, I believe, was the other name under advisement. "

        "Content": "War, as Fallout 3 so famously puts it, never changes. While the weapons and tactics may differ, it's still about chaos and fear and the overwhelming of the senses as adrenaline surges through your veins. That's a hard experience to capture on a screen, but the Call of Duty series comes close thanks to its constant redefinition of what \"11\" is in terms of intensity for first-person shooters. Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare delivered an awesome and varied single-player experience that was matched with an even better multiplayer suite, and it made for some really big shoes for Call of Duty: World at War to fill.  If you've been living in Antarctica the past year and haven't heard, then yes, World at War returns back to the series' World War II roots.  This has caused no end of grumbling from fans of Modern Warfare's contemporary setting, as well as the fact that this installment was done by Treyarch , a sister-studio to Call of Duty-creator Infinity Ward. Treyarch did the somewhat-maligned Call of Duty 3, but the studio looks to atone for that by delivering a game with an impressive amount of content. There's a solid single-player campaign, co-op play, a huge multiplayer suite, and even a fun, silly mode featuring zombies.   Video Review - Watch or download here (HD available).   It certainly helps that World at War focuses on the less popularized theaters of World War II. Instead of serving up Normandy and D-Day for what would have been the umpteenth time for World War II shooters, the game covers the island hopping campaign in the Pacific as well as the Red Army's reversal of the tide at Stalingrad all the way to the Fall of Berlin. This provides some interesting new battlefields set on sun-bleached coral atolls in the Pacific. You will see some more familiar spots with the bombed-out cities and farmlands ofthe Eastern Front missions, but it's still well done.   Collector's Edition Content The Collector's Edition offers up the metal tin container that we've come to expect from collector's edition these days. There's also a miniature canteen that comes with the package, however it's not intended for drinking, so it's more of a trinket. Users also get a special gun for multiplayer. For a collector's edition it definitely falls on the skimpy side in terms of extras. For instance, there is no art book or \"making of\" DVD to speak of, which is disappointing since it retails at $20 more than the regular edition.   War tends to be a savage affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers swarm out of the brush, erupting out of spider holes to charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Though set outdoors, it feels like close-quarters combat much of the time. Meanwhile, the Russian Front is full of merciless moments; there's plenty of gunning down of wounded and unarmed soldiers by both sides, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself.   War is hell. Again. This remains a Call of Duty game through and through. What that means is that the action is fast and fluid, as well as rigidly scripted. The success of the franchise proves that there's a vast audience for that, and this won't change anyone's mind. Enemy soldiers and your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessly until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop reappearing. Then you advance to the next firefight and repeat the process over again. The thing is, you're far too busy shooting and ducking and dying to really notice much of the time. The sense of immersion is pretty complete.  There are plenty of deafening, large-scale set-piece battles, but there's also variation to change things up. Case in point is the PBY mission, where you man the guns on a Navy aircraft. At first glance, this seems to be a mirror to the Spectre Gunship mission in Modern Warfare; in both missions you rain fire down from above. But the Spectre Gunship mission has a cold detachment to it; those tiny blips on the screen that are human beings die from a foe that they cannot see and fight back against. In World at War's PBY mission, you're in the midst of a raging air and sea battle, taking damage and fighting for your life. Or there's a sniper mission to whack a German general that doesn't quite have the cat-and-mouse feeling of Modern Warfare's sniper level.   Tanks are in one Russian level. The campaign does suffer a bit due to its broad scope; the narrative skips over months at a time, showcasing the major battles of the war. The result is that the sense of story doesn't seem as strong as it did in Modern Warfare. It probably doesn't help that we all know how the war eventually turned out; Modern Warfare had the advantage of a fictionalized story with plenty of shocking twists and turns.    All told, the single-player campaign is about as short as that in Modern Warfare, but it doesn't drag on. Plus, there's considerably more replayability here because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode with up to three other players. I say the bulk because a handful of missions are missing, notably the sniper mission and the PBY mission; the former wouldn't make sense with four snipers, while the latter doesn't have enough room in the narrow PBY for more than one player to scamper about. Not only is the campaign in co-op, but there's also a Death Card system reminiscent of Halo 3's skull system. Scattered throughout the campaign are death cards that you can find. Each one unlocks a different capability, like Sticks & Stones, which only gives you a knife and dud grenades. Sure, it might seem strange, but it lets you have fun if you want to challenge yourself.  Multiplayer is definitely an area where World at War shines. Modern Warfare had arguably one of the greatest multiplayer suites in recent history, and World at War builds on it. There remains the create-a-class and rank system that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and upgrades that you can then mix-and-match to create different load outs. Many of Modern Warfare's perks are here, adjusted for the earlier age. For instance, what used to be the UAV Jammer is now Camouflage to keep you from being spotted by any spotting planes the enemy calls in.   Not what you want to see. There are also about a dozen new perks, about half of which are associated with vehicles for the four huge vehicle-enabled maps. And while tanks can deal out a lot of punishment, they're also very vulnerable to infantry antitank weapons and other tanks. Driving around in a tank is cool, but you'll realize just how slow World War II-era tanks are. Just like in real-life, you need to coordinate infantry and armor together for maximum effectiveness, and it's nice that the PC version has built-in voice chat. Fans of Modern Warfare on the PC had to set up third-party voice systems out of game to talk to one another.  The reward mechanic in World at War is also similar, but it does have a nice twist. Three kills in a row gets you a spotting plane rather than a UAV, five kills gives you an artillery strike instead of an air strike, and seven kills without dying lets you call in my favorite new feature: dogs. Yes, you unleash the hounds of war, a pack of killer dogs that will make a beeline to the enemy (helpful in spotting where they're hiding) as well as tear their throats out if they can. The dogs are difficult to take down, because they'll swarm you, and if you're busy shooting at the dogs you're often not paying attention to the fact that an opponent is lining you up in his sights.   Good thing that PBYs float. All the popular modes from Modern Warfare return, like Headquarters (each team battles to seize a point on the map; the team that does doesn't gets to respawn if they die), search and destroy, team deathmatch and the like. There are also two new modes, war and capture-the-flag. The former is similar to Battlefield's conquest mode; there are five points on the map that must be seized. The kicker is that only one point is under contention at a time, so it focuses the action. (And, yes, Call of Duty 3 fans will recognize that it had war mode as well.)  And then there's the icing on the cake, a silly-yet-fun bonus co-op mode called Nacht der Untoten, or Night of the Undead. It's also referred to as Nazi Zombies, and it's a last stand against waves of oncoming zombies. You and up to three others are holed up inside a bunker; the zombies try to break down the barricades at the doors and windows and you have to kill them. Each wave becomes harder by throwing more zombies at you or making the zombies faster or both. You gain points for killing the zombies and for rebuilding the barricades, and these points can be used to purchase weapons, ammo, and access to other parts of the bunker. There's even a mystery box that can serve up a ray gun straight out of 1940s pulp fiction. Still, eventually the zombies will kill you, and the goal is to survive as long as possible to compare your performance on the leaderboard.  Given that it uses the Modern Warfare engine, World at War looks every bit as good on both the PC and the Xbox 360. I've always been impressed with the level of detail on everything; walk up to a fellow soldier and you can see the seams in their clothing. The most memorable visual in the game for me has to be the arterial blood spray that happens when a human body gets torn apart by explosions and gunfire. The dark red of the blood is in stark contrast to the dust and smoke in the air. And the frame rate is Call of Duty-smooth on both platforms from that I saw. (For comparison purposes, the PC I used had a Core 2 Quad processor with an 8800GTX and 2GB of RAM. All detail settings were set to maximum at 1920x1200 resolution.)   The death cards are like Halo 3's skulls.  Activision tapped Hollywood's top talent for the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does his part for the Marines, while Gary Oldman is the main voice for the Russians. Sutherland's voice is so distinct that it's easy to imagine him in the recording booth, bellowing his lines into the microphone (that must have been some recording session). Oldman, who has made a career out of being an utter chameleon, is almost unrecognizable in his role, and he delivers a convincing Russian accent. The rest of the sound effects are as authentic as we've come to expect; when you hear the metallic thunk of various machine guns you know that the sound guys spent a lot of time shooting and recording those World War II guns in a desert somewhere. Yet it's the mixing of all these elements that makes a Call of Duty game; there's so much audio erupting all over the place, from gunfire, explosions, guys yelling out commands or warnings, the whistle of artillery above, to the rumbling of vehicles nearby. It all combines to create a rich soundscape comparable to those in movies."

Sutherland's voice is so distinct that it's easy to imagine him in the recording booth, bellowing his lines into the microphone (that must have been some recording session). Oldman, who has made a career out of being an utter chameleon, is almost unrecognizable in his role, and he delivers a convincing Russian accent. The rest of the sound effects are as authentic as we've come to expect; when you hear the metallic thunk of various machine guns you know that the sound guys spent a lot of time shooting and recording those World War II guns in a desert somewhere. Yet it's the mixing of all these elements that makes a Call of Duty game; there's so much audio erupting all over the place, from gunfire, explosions, guys yelling out commands or warnings, the whistle of artillery above, to the rumbling of vehicles nearby. It all combines to create a rich soundscape comparable to those in movies."

        "Content": "Fable II is designed to be all things to all players. The game has the same lofty ambition at its foundation as the original - to allow you to be the character you want, with the world changing in response to your actions. Good, bad, man, woman, gay, straight, pure, corrupt \u2013 it's up to you. The sequel, however, also wants to be accessible, eschewing the original's reliance on the mini-map and its clunky combat mechanics. Fable II instead streamlines everything \u2013 a glowing trail directs you to your next quest, while combat has been drastically simplified, theoretically making this a game that even non-gamers can play.  It's bold stuff, but not entirely successful. Don't get us wrong, Fable II is a wonderful game - and we'll continue to play it long after this review has hit teh intrawebs \u2013 but at the same time we can't help but feel that Lionhead has held back in some departments and made the wrong decisions in others. We'll get to all that soon ( 'oh you tease' \u2013 readers), but first, let me tell you about a little place called Albion (abridged version).  The age of heroes has passed. Industry has arrived in Albion and most of the people no longer believe in magic. They're idiots. Magic is alive and well, and while you may start out as a street urchin, your destiny is to unite 'the four' \u2013 your character plus three other heroes representing Strength, Will and Skill respectively, and bring about the downfall of the game's Big Bad; Lucien.  And that's all we'll say about it \u2013 the story doesn't do anything all that new, but does feature some memorable and idiosyncratic characters, so we'll leave that for you to discover. In terms of the structure, you start out as a child, and move through to adolescence and beyond. The early portion of the game sees you starting to shape the character you want to be and the world that you'll inherit later in life. It's all pretty black and white stuff \u2013 a series of good-or-bad, help-or-hinder options, with only one \u2013 whether you give back a set of warrants to the guards or instead pass them on to Arthur, one of the town's criminals - having any real ramifications later.   Go on, guess what the caption is going to be. If you guessed  The game proper really starts once childhood has passed. Now you can take on true quests, start interacting with NPCs, start earning EXP and leveling up, go out hunting for collectibles, and start earning gold and spending it on an incredible wealth of options. This really is a massive world, and while you're not given great gobs of freedom to go off the beaten path, Albion has numerous bustling towns, villages and encampments to explore, heaps of stores, stalls and wandering traders to do business with, and a varied bestiary to slaughter.  Fable II is nothing if not a sandbox, and it's a huge and multifaceted one. Mucking around with the many simulations and systems in the game is hugely compelling, and one of the chief reasons that the experience is so powerful. It's the sense of being a kid in a candy store, with a bounty of options; so many varied and exotic flavours to sample that you're often not sure what to try next.  For starters there's the distinction between being good or bad, pure or corrupt, and this can change the game in ways both subtle and drastic. If you're an evil mofo who goes around killing civilians, they'll run screaming in the opposite direction whenever you go near them, whereas if you're loved, people will mob you and cheer. Your alignment ties into thornier morality choices than those in the game's opening too \u2013 what are you prepared to give up to do the right thing? And for that matter, how far are you prepared to go to be evil?  There's a complete economic system in the game too. Stalls and shops are worth more in a town that's thriving, and you can influence this \u2013 go around killing people, for instance, and you'll drive the local economy down, invest in a place, on the other hand, and maybe that's what it needs to get back on its feet. Not only do your wider actions influence prices, but so too do your direct relationships with NPCs - a store owner that loves you will give you a discount\u2026 as will a store owner that fears you. Prices change (shops with sales on or goods shortages are well worth looking out for), and you can buy every building in the game, whether residential or commercial. Buy a shop and you'll have a steady income from it (influenced, of course, by how you set the prices and how good the local economy is), not to mention a massive owner's discount. Buy a house and you can either move your family in or rent it out.   So how is it that I\u0092m diving in a lake and coming up with a steak and kidney pie? Aah, the wonders of loot.  One of the coolest things about the Fable games is the fact that NPCs aren't just window dressing or quest dispensers; they react to your presence. Wander into a town waving your sword around or casting spells and they'll freak out. Play your lute, do a dance or show off a trophy and a crowd will gather. Visit a town where you have a family and your child will likely follow on your heels, nattering the whole way, while villagers make comments like \"your daughter is an absolute nightmare.\" This is by far the most reactive RPG yet, and it makes the world that much more interesting.  Then there's getting married and having a family, interacting with your dog and teaching it new tricks, learning new expressions, customising your clothes, your hair and the furniture in your house(s), getting tattoos, taking on jobs (bartender, blacksmith and assassin, to name a few), joining cults, finding gargoyles and statue plinths, solving Demon Doors and Expression Statues, discovering silver keys and silver key chests, unlocking honorifics, playing co-op with friends and more.  There's just so much to experiment with, and your options only increase the more you play. By a few hours in you'll have a long list of 'what if?' questions to be checked off before the end of the game. What if I kill my wife? Will my child become an orphan? What if I sleep in someone else's bed? What's the worst that can happen? What happens if I resist arrest after committing a crime? What happens if my character is entirely evil and corrupt, but also incredibly attractive? How will people respond to me?   It's all great stuff, but at its core, Fable II is still a pretty traditional RPG. That means wandering about the wilderness on quests, killing almost anything that moves. That means leveling up your abilities and weapons. That means exploring the world and finding loot. In these traditional RPG departments, Fable II is a whole lot of fun, but certainly has its issue.  On the positive side of the fence, the simplified combat is really entertaining. It doesn't offer quite as much depth as we might like, but it is easy to use, and having melee, ranged and magic all assigned to a button, allowing you to switch between them easily, is a good system. As you level up in Strength and Skill, you'll unlock flourishes and counters in combat, you'll gain in strength and in speed, and you'll unlock body part-specific targeting for ranged weapons. It's leveling up Will, however, that is the highlight, with a great selection of spells on offer. Each type of magic can unleash an area of effect attack or a targeted attack, and you'll soon be attacking with flame, lightning and vortexes, as well as force pushing enemies, confusing them, slowing time and raising the dead (having fresh corpses around will raise more powerful specters), among others. The downside of the magic system is that it's not until many hours into the game that you'll have true, dynamic options in battle.  The way the system works is that holding down B charges your selected level one magic attack. Release it to unleash or keep holding down, as the game will then charge your selected level two attack, and so on. It's great when you've leveled up a couple of spells to the forth tier or higher, because you can have a number accessible from the chain, but when you're toiling away with first and second level spells, only having instant access to a couple is a pain\u2026 although thankfully your selected spells can be changed quickly either by holding down the right trigger or by going into the Abilities menu.   Lute players were the lead guitarists of their day.  It's worth persisting of course, because it won't be all that long before you'll have real power at your fingertips. At the first sign of battle, for instance, you might charge your level four raise the dead spell \u2013 sending out four specters to battle your enemies and keep them off your tail, before charging your level two time slow spell, allowing you to pepper the enemies with targeted level one lightning and area of effect level three inferno while they move in slow-mo. You get the idea.  Transitioning between melee, ranged and magic is simple enough \u2013 although the game sometimes won't register a press when you switch, which can be a pain. While the melee and ranged combat feels a little vanilla \u2013 and the flourish system means pauses in the action as opposed to slick, flowing combos, it's still great fun. You'll get experience boosts for mixing up your attack style, not taking damage and using the environment \u2013 such as knocking an enemy off a ledge, but this isn't as interesting as it could be. Still, when you enter the Crucible \u2013 gladiatorial combat in eight successively trickier arenas, the game's combat more than holds up\u2026 even if unleashing high level undead on your foes as a distraction does make combat a little easier than it should be. More on that later.  So, we mentioned that the game has a few issues. The first is that the HUD for Fable II has been streamlined considerably from the original game's, but to be honest we really don't think it works that well. As stated in the opening paragraph, the mini-map is gone \u2013 the team felt that players spent too much time playing on the map rather than playing in the world, but the reality is that players will now just blindly follow the glowing trail, which still isn't really playing in the world. \"Just turn it off then\" you say. Well, that's all well and good, but there is no adequate map replacement. Sure, if you pause the game you'll get a tiny map of the region you're in, and sure, if you go down to the 'Regions' section of the pause menu, you can bring up tiny maps of the other areas in the game, but there's no indication of how these fit together \u2013 you have no idea where they are in relation to each other. There's no decent overall map, and even these piecemeal maps aren't much good.   Flames in the (na)palm of your hand.  Yes, you can see where houses are and where paths are, but there's very little fidelity in showing where your quests are (i.e. you can't zoom in) and in other areas it's entirely deficient. You'd think that coming across a Demon Door or a Silver Key Chest that you can't yet open would see those locations pop up on the map, but no. You've either got to try and remember the location, write it down or hope you stumble across it again later. This simply isn't good enough. It's fine to take the mini-map off the HUD, but to not have workable maps anywhere ? That's crazy. Instead of playing on the in-game mini-map, you'll be playing on the pause screen mini-map, constantly cross-referencing where you are against it. And the much appreciated ability to auto-travel to any major destination you've already been to is great, but it does mean you'll only piece together where a few things are in relation to each other.  The other thing on the HUD that is meant to streamline the gameplay but ends up taking power out of the hands of the player is the context-sensitive D-pad commands. The idea is this. When you're near your dog, the commands available to you will be related to the dog \u2013 hit left to admonish, right to pet and up to play fetch, for instance. Or if you just picked up a book that can teach you a new expression, you can read it by just hitting down, instead of searching through the oh-so-clunky pause menu (more on that in a minute). Other context sensitive selections include food for when you're low on health, or expressions for when you highlight an NPC. It sounds good in theory, but in practice it's just too finicky. Trying to get the dog options to display when your dog is moving around is harder than just bringing up the expression wheel, and if it steps away you'll end up eating a steak and kidney pie instead of patting them damn thing. We do like the way the hotkeyed expressions change on the D-pad when you're interacting with someone \u2013 so you're not just doing the same expression over and over, but given that it's more efficient to check out what expressions that particular person likes (hitting Y brings up information about each NPC) and then just manually selecting them, that's still not a massive plus.   So the HUD is a little too minimalist to be useful, but the options in the pause menu go in the opposite direction \u2013 it's incredibly cluttered and unwieldy. RPG veterans will get their heads around it quickly enough and will put up with it, but we'd hate to think how difficult newcomers to the genre may find it. In fact, so much stuff is buried so deeply in the pause menu that unless you really go exploring, you may not even stumble across it. A few examples\u2026  Why is the Books and Documents section of my inventory such a dog's breakfast? Seriously, there's like, 50 items in there, all in a row with no way to sort them. I've got 20 pages of Lucien's diary \u2013 all listed separately and not even in the correct order! It's a nightmare to try and sift through. Why is it that when I've found a dog training manual out in the world it's still for sale in the town bookstore? And why does the game let me buy it, even though when I 'read' it, it will have no effect and disappear from my inventory?  Why is it that when I'm buying a weapon I can't see at a glance whether I have one in my inventory already, or how the weapon I'm thinking about buying compares stat-wise to my current weapon? Why do I have to back out of the shop interface, into my inventory, check, then back out and go into the store interface again? Clunky stuff.  The game also doesn't put quite enough power in the hands of the player. Yes, your actions determine the alignment of your character, how his or her physical appearance evolves and how he or she is seen by the world, but the actual character customisation options are quite thin on the ground. There really aren't that many different types of weapons you can buy (although the Augment system helps give them some variety), nor are there that many clothing options, which is surprising given the emphasis on choice. Yes, you can customise their colours by finding and buying dyes (the best one? 'Indigo of the rare Montoya genus. You have crushed its flowers. Prepare to dye') but that's a bit of a hassle. The basic clothes available are pretty sparse to be honest, and sadly, because many have stat boosts (or losses) associated with them, you'll more often than not go for the clothes with the right stat boosts as opposed to the ones that best represent your character.   Dude! Don't kill the Rockbiter! What did he ever do to you?  I guess the one other gripe we should mention is the notion of consequences. By and large your actions do have both short term and long term impacts upon the world, but every so often the curtain is pulled aside to reveal the artifice of the world. One example is a mission for the Temple of Shadows where you're asked to slaughter the entire population of a town. This wasn't a quest I took lightly. I assumed that I would have to live with serious consequences from the decision. Perhaps I would no longer have access to quests in the town? Perhaps it would become overrun with criminals in the wake of my murderous spree? Not so. After callously shooting down the villagers as they ran screaming from me (rather poetically in the shadow of a sculpture of myself in the midst of the growl expression I might add), they were all back two days later. Yes, there were some lasting repercussions \u2013 the Temple of Light became a smoking crater and more Temple of Shadows members were wandering around the town, but part of me hoped that an act like that would have serious consequences that I'd have to live with. Oh, and my comeuppance for killing 37 innocent peasants? Yeah, just do some community service.  You'll also notice NPCs that you kill re-appear in their former spots (perhaps with a change of name, but still the same character model), and also that NPCs will often just disappear after you've completed their quest. Albion, then, lacks some permanency, but honestly, we're only holding it up to this level of scrutiny because it gets so much other stuff right.  In fact, I really should underline that none these issues are deal breakers. They're absolutely worth mentioning, but at no stage did they reduce our stinging compulsion to keep playing. Fable II is easily one of the most enjoyable games we've played this year.  Before we wrap things up, a few quick comments on other aspects of the game. The art design is fantastic \u2013 part Dickensian, part fantasy, with plenty of personality. One moment you're in urban slums, surrounded by vagabonds and prostitutes, the next you're amongst rich dandies strolling the more affluent streets. One day you're running through an idyllic rural village, the next you're taking a tall ship out to Lion's Head island in search of treasure. From the intensely green rolling hills and forests through to creepy marshland pocked by rotten, abandoned houses, Albion is a place you'll want to explore.  It has plenty of character in other areas too. Dialogue and voice acting is consistently excellent, and you'll overhear some hilarious conversations if you hang around certain NPCs after you're expected to. Even item descriptions and the quotes from Albion citizens on the (frequent) load screens can be laugh out loud funny.   Heal your dog you bastard. "

        "id": "3fe4109bb90836664c12ff87b8dfd6f0",
        "Content": "On the surface, LittleBigPlanet is all about jumping and stickers and rainbows and ponies and having a good time with friends. But if you delve deeper and look past the infectiously approachable presentation, there's something far more curious at play. LittleBigPlanet is actually all about the fundamentals of cause and effect relationships, man in his environment and how we relate to the world around us. Anyone at all familiar with programming will see this as the classic 'IF/THEN' structure of coding, too. IF you drop the rubber ball, THEN it bounces. IF you push the ball down the ramp, THEN it rolls with increasing momentum.  That's LittleBigPlanet. IF you have patience and creativity, THEN LittleBigPlanet is thoroughly fantastic, rich and deep. IF you have a net connection, social skills and like to share and rate content, THEN you'll be delighted. But this works conversely too; IF these ideas don't appeal, you're easily frustrated by complex controls and occasional physics quirks, THEN LittleBigPlanet might not be your thing.  Developer Media Molecule has a technical achievement disguised as a sandbox-platformer on its hands. This is the single most accomplished integration of physics into gameplay that we've encountered -- showing up the much-touted Digital Molecular Matter in one deft stroke.    The small team -- only a fraction the size of your average development crew on a AAA game -- had big ambitions. They drafted a scenario of three distinct and entirely linked paths for gamers to play: the single/co-op game, a workshop stage and an online community to pull it all together. All three modes are cleverly modelled around planets in the fabric and cardboard solar system, and your Sackboy or girl, who amusingly operates a PS3 controller onboard their cardboard spaceship, navigates the cursor over the surface of each planet.  Initially, only the LittleBigPlanet itself is available to be played upon; you're led into the basics of jumping by the golden-voiced Stephen Fry, who does his best to liven up what could've been a dry hand-holding instructional process. After mastering grabbing, manipulating switches, jumping and transitioning into the background, you're free to begin the adventure -- and it's definitely an experience that benefits from having a few friends to join in the fun alongside. With four players all jumping, jetpacking and stickering around you, things can get a little bit scattered at times. The camera is generally up to the task of tracking and pulling out far enough to keep everyone in the picture at all times, and the framerate never drops.  Progressing through the Media Molecule levels isn't just a good idea simply to unlock that coveted Zebra-stripe pattern or new car, rocket cart or lamp post -- it also gives you a great idea of exactly how far you can push LittleBigPlanet's toolset in the right set of creative, patient and dedicated hands. Those worried that the game couldn't possibly offer enough variety beyond basic platforming can sleep sound; the game tosses some very original concepts your way. We came across street racing, jump ropes, ball-in-a-maze puzzles, quirky foot races and even a mission where you have to drag a fat Mexican wrestler by his hair down a mineshaft to a (presumably illegal) wrestling match. Brilliant.   Some of the preset themes you can choose from. All that's missing from this one is an ageing Harrison Ford and George Lucas eating a chocolate donut.  Being based on the earth's continental layout, each stage takes place in a visually varied location. Japanese gardens filled with mist, dry South American deserts, New York City streets and icy Arctic stages are just a handful of the places you'll visit. Each is populated by a quirky cast of marionette characters, usually there to provide some sort of framework for what you're doing in each stage. Some, like the skeleton wedding, look as if they've been pulled from a Tim Burton production, while others like the Japanese garden, play with mythology. Every object you unlock in each level relates directly back to the objects around you, too.  The developer clearly understood how potentially daunting an immediately-accessible list of objects, options and locations would be to a first-time player and wisely drip-feed you new items as you progress through the single-player game. If you beat the initial stages, set in a sunshine-and-gumdrops cardboard kingdom, you're given a sampling of each material type and structure to get you started down the path of user-created content. Each level, however, contains between 30 and 80 hidden items to be collected, many of which are only accessible if you trigger sticker-switches (apply the right shaped sticker to the right blank space) or if you bring a pal along for some co-op play. The cynic in us can't help but question if it's fair to make large portions off-limits to people without a second controller, however. A separate one-player-friendly way of getting to this content would've been thoughtful -- though, we're sure Sony's accessories department are plenty happy about this decision.   The Popit menu system, touted as being an innovative item selection and customisation tool in one, is what links your Sackboy to the world; it's also the source of every item, sticker, tool, and device and a self-destruct option at your disposal. The hovering 2D rectangle is linked directly to your Sackboy by a glowing coloured filament, keeping your menu distinct from your friends'. In a multiplayer scenario, the smaller, vertical-oriented shape of the Popit means that everyone can have their menus open at once without filling the whole screen. The lack of transparency in these boxes and in text bubbles does make it feel a little claustrophobic though. Also, in one-player mode, the set size of the Popit is frankly too small; an option to rescale it and change the opacity is sorely needed. As such, it's not too much of a hassle to flick between pages in the Popit or scroll up and down, but you'll be doing it a lot, and the more objects visible at once, the better, we think. It's just not quite as intuitive as it needs to be.  Regardless of how you feel about your screen real estate, nobody in their right minds could fault LittleBigPlanet's presentation. This is the first game on the PlayStation 3 that truly looks like it could only operate with significant parallel processing, provided by the PS3's Cell architecture. While the 360 could arguably pull off the physics or the engine itself, LittleBigPlanet combines incredible physics processing with stunning 1080p clarity, rich colours, HDR lighting and light bloom, depth of field, enormous scale, particle and refraction effects and a laundry list of lush textures, shades, maps and animated details. Load times are minimal and content sharing takes up no space, since every texture and object is already stored on your copy of the game, outside of PSEye-original textures. It's arguably one of the best looking games available right now, hands down. Michel Gondry would be proud.    The soundtrack also stands out with its bubblegum acoustic pop music, playful electro-rock from Battles (nice choice) and some grand orchestral music for the epic final levels of the story mode. All of these songs can be unlocked for use in the Create mode too, for an added touch of atmosphere.  More impressively, LittleBigPlanet gives players the keys to the castle, allowing you to take apart every object in the world, create raw 3D shapes with physical properties imbued, link them together with basic programming and put together incredible user-created content. This is where LittleBigPlanet kicks two very important goals -- one, with wholeheartedly and correctly embracing community-created content to keep players hooked, and two, thereby extending the game's lifespan near-on indefinitely.  If the backbone of LittleBigPlanet is the creator mode and the single/co-op mode is where you flesh out and the creator mode by unlocking new parts, then this community element is the third pillar of LittleBigPlanet's design -- the arms and legs of the game if you will.  By signing into your PSN account, you're given access to your own Home Planet, a place that tracks your creations, your stats and records. More importantly, you can also now access a globe crisscrossed with a constellation of user-submitted content that you can instantly download, play through, copy back to your custom-content planet for safe-keeping or to break down and redo. You can also submit one-word-reviews from a selection of descriptors, such as 'easy', 'beautiful', 'clever, 'points-fest' and more. This feedback is tracked at all times, and 'hearting' the best creations you've stumbled across pushes them into the spotlight on a global level, YouTube or Halo 3 style.   Sackboy onboard his space vessel, surveying planets to destroy. Here, you can see Alderaan.  This would all be nearly useless if it wasn't presented in such a perfect and intuitive manner. LittleBigPlanet's planet-surface interface allows you to quickly spot the biggest, most interesting levels at a glance, with custom circular labels created by users (either using the PSEye to take a photo or from a vast selection of symbols or designs). In a game that will ultimately live or die by the level of community participation, it's a big relief to see that the community pillar doesn't just work, but works flawlessly. Bravo.  There are a few rough edges and words of caution that we really wanted to turn a blind eye to but couldn't. Sackboy spends a good deal of his time jumping. As such, you'd really want to make sure that the jump-mechanic works perfectly the first time, and that transitioning between different planes (the foreground to the background) is 100% reliable. Unfortunately, we found that judging a jump's distance wasn't always as concrete and definitive as it should be; the Sackboys are a little bit 'floaty' at times, and you'll end up over or under compensating mid-air, which might frustrate some players. Then there's the automatic detection of which plane you're trying to access; mostly the game gets it right, but sometimes -- more often than is healthy -- you'll struggle to get your character to pass behind a plane or leap onto the right ledge.   The checkpoint system also swings between well-placed and unforgiving; given that your health is tied to whatever checkpoint you've just crossed, sometimes you'll have three tries to complete a section of the level yet others will give you a dozen. During a multiplayer game, if you're playing with someone who's a little green around the gills at their platforming, that could mean a lot of restarting the whole level from scratch.  LittleBigPlanet's physics are perfect to a fault, too. There were five or six separate occasions where essential game objects would sometimes get wedged at awkward angles in the environment and impede progress. For example, we were racing in the hotrod in a later level and we went down a slope and the nose of the car hit the ground but the lead axel stayed on the level above, keeping the car wedged diagonally, with none of the tyres making contact with the surface. We had to jump up and down underneath the car for five minutes in order to very slowly pry it off the edge above and continue to point the car in the right direction in order to trigger an event so we could finish the level. That was one example of a time when we prayed for a quick object-reset option, much like the provided quick Sackboy-reset.    Finally, with so much depth to the creation mode, the Popit menu system and controls are a tad convoluted. Moving between different depths on the plane (creating the background, mid-ground and foreground) is handled by the shoulder buttons, rather than by using the thumbsticks to orient the object in 3D space. What that means is that you really need to be paying full attention to how you're  lining objects up, gluing them together and how everything is going to come together with physics activated. It's complex stuff, but made trickier by the feeble rewind system that spends more time looking funky than being a practical rewind option. We don't need to see a cool VCR-style effect just to undo our last move; just let us jump back a few stages with a few quick taps. Hopefully an update will allow for users to choose how they prefer to rewind. "

Below the surface, it\u2019s the same story. I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for some of the downright disturbing (in a good way!) buried biomes I came across, and I\u2019d rather not spoil them for you here other than to say to expect the unexpected. It's fully possible to land on a frozen world and drill down to a liquid ocean, beneath which is a temple made of bones, which in turn hides a steampunk mineshaft leading even deeper to a lava-filled mini dungeon. And that's just in one vertical slice of a single planet. Exciting, randomized locations, hidden ruins, new crafting resources, and quests round out these worlds and help them come alive. Other than gathering resources, the main way you interact with these places is by killing their inhabitants. The side-scrolling combat, whether you prefer a melee weapon or slightly more thematically appropriate firearms, is tactical, responsive, and at times intensely challenging. Diverse enemies and fighting styles allow experimentation and prevent battles from becoming stagnant and repetitive. Meanwhile each weapon type has a specific niche and encourages a different style of fighting, to the point that switching from a sniper rifle to a sword and shield made me feel like I was almost playing a different game. Starbound Official Screens 9 Images I especially loved the story-based chapter bosses. Each of them is very distinct from the next, and some of the later ones are a serious challenge straight from the old-school Mega Man playbook, ranging from massive, skeletal dragons to lightning-quick swordsmen with complex attack patterns to learn. The frantic, retro-hardcore difficulty left me craving more. It's easy for its risk-reward systems to catch you in a death spiral.Starbound did manage to frustrate me a few times, in that it\u2019s a bit too easy for its risk-reward systems to catch you in a death spiral. Dying in most areas means dropping all of your crafting materials, food, and consumables. If that happens to be in the depths of an ice world past several fathoms of respawning enemies, getting back to your stuff intact can be a huge problem. That in itself is fairly standard roguelike gameplay, but the hitch is that healing items become absolutely critical in the late game, and sometimes I found myself in a vicious cycle where multiple deaths depleted not just my supply, but my ability to acquire more of these necessary provisions by draining my bank account. Farming resources to recover from that was some of the least enjoyable time I spent with Starbound. label=A%20New%20Frontier The story itself isn\u2019t the most complex or mind-blowing, but the universe that developer Chucklefish built to tell it in is overflowing with character and detail. Each of the six sentient races has a unique culture, architectural style, and ongoing conflict that must be resolved in order to save the galaxy. From ferocious plant people struggling with a subculture of cannibalism to self-aware robots stuck in a humorously medieval mindset due to a glitch in their programming, there\u2019s plenty of it. Books and other documents hidden throughout the sprawling levels provide details on everything from political history to hunting rituals, and the inventive, scripted dungeons at the end of each chapter let you interact with these hinted-at elements up close and personal. A major highlight of the story quests was a full-on castle siege, in which my NPC crew and I had to defend a batty nobleman\u2019s destructible keep from waves of enemies armed with catapults. I also really enjoyed the chapter dungeon for the super-smart primate Apex species, in which I infiltrated an underground facility run by their Big Brother-esque government to open the way for friendly rebels fighting a real-time battle, which was visible on the surface above me. It's clear the level designers weren't afraid to push the boundaries of what a side-scrolling dungeon can be, and it paid off beautifully. Yet they weren\u2019t vain enough to force us into it, so all of that story is optional. There\u2019s nothing to stop you from going off and setting your own exploration or building goals in traditional Minecraft or Terraria fashion. If you just want to make an underwater Viking fortress on a remote planet with trophies of all the space sharks you've killed, you can be on your merry way. But if you choose to let the story guide you, it interweaves itself with the non-story-based progression paths in a way that made me feel like I didn\u2019t need to pick one or the other. In between chapter bosses, I was often prompted to travel to new worlds, contact a new race, discover new resources, and craft better equipment \u2013 all things I would have been doing anyway. By the end of the story quest chain \u2013 around 40 hours later, granted I spent a lot of that time doing non- story related things \u2013 I had a good grasp on what further adventures were available to me, and how best to prepare myself for them. The story supplements the core gameplay, rather than merely sitting on top of it. I've never felt quite so much stylistic freedom in a 2D crafting game before.If building is more your thing, there are hundreds of structural and decorative blocks that can be collected and crafted to create exactly the look you\u2019re going for. From the various alien styles you can deconstruct and rebuild to craftable statuary and scores of available materials available across countless planets, I've never felt quite so much stylistic freedom in a 2D crafting game before. Even something as simple as a two-room A-frame shelter can be built a thousand different ways, to say nothing of planet-spanning fortresses that take multiple players multiple days to assemble. Small, personal outposts can grow into full-blown colonies, as you purchase charters that allow NPCs to move into the makeshift neighborhoods you\u2019ve created. They\u2019ll even pay you rent for your trouble, and more elaborate and embellished settlements will attract higher-paying clients. This creates a compelling reward loop for what would otherwise just be a freeform decorating minigame."

        "Content": "There\u2019s incredible power to Bloodborne. It\u2019s not just an amazing dance of dodges and swipes through encounters that often push the limits of reflexes and endurance, it\u2019s a thought-provoking experience that\u2019s wormed its way into my mind and melted my resolve. But through perseverance, patient growth, and determined skill, it\u2019s proved itself an unconventional adventure that ultimately gives much more than it takes \u2013 which at times can be a staggering cost. By the end, the only frustrations that don\u2019t turn to triumphs are the technical ones. After more than 60 hours of grappling with its terrors, monsters, and the environment itself, I\u2019m left dumbfounded by Bloodborne\u2019s capability to draw powerful emotions from me, and make me earn the successes that I\u2019ll remember for years to come.  Its unconventional approach to action-RPG gameplay walks a fine line between utter elation and despair as it takes us on an awe-inspiring journey through the highest peaks of satisfaction and the deepest, blackest pits of exhausted desperation. Developer From Software chooses to tell us little about how to survive its gauntlet, and yet expects feats of intelligence and perseverance in the face of its brutal, unrelenting difficulty. That balance is slightly upset by painfully long loading screens upon death or travel to different zones, but the highs of taking down one of the many intimidating bosses make up for those chunks of downtime.  Bloodborne\u2019s semi-open world structure and hard-earned progression draw heavily from the Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games that made From famous, though the aggressive new pace of combat is all its own. These diving, rolling melee battles with an awesome arsenal of transforming melee weapons and tactical sidearms chiseled away my calluses and made me form new ones, even as a hardened Dark Souls veteran. Switching weapons between their light and heavy modes on the fly to string together combo-like attack chains in an engaging way injects a newfound versatility, even if it\u2019s a less calculating kind of battle than we see in From\u2019s earlier games.  That doesn\u2019t make it any easier, though. Being overwhelmed by enemies is commonplace, but thanks to your ability to leech back lost health with quick counterattacks and to stun opponents with secondary weapons, I found it\u2019s possible to sustain a constant onslaught when I\u2019d built up enough skill.  And these tools are absolutely needed, as Bloodborne\u2019s horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends. Creature design strikes terror in many ways \u2013 enormous axe-swinging skeletons, peculiar semi-transparent childlike creatures, and subtle creepiness, like a coven of wailing, cleaver wielding hags \u2013 but each entity is well-crafted and triumphantly threatening. That\u2019s best exemplified by the bosses, which have the power to mystify, terrify, and infuriate. I ultimately found many of those big fights much simpler than getting past the trial-and-error battles with dozens of smaller enemies I fought to reach them, but the satisfaction in each and every victory was huge.

Bloodborne Brendan Graeber + 1 more  The progression that follows those hard-fought wins is a carefully doled-out treat in Bloodborne. For one thing, the glowing pale purple lamps that serve as its version of checkpoints are scarce. Surviving long enough to reach the next point is rarely an option you can count on, but delving out of your comfort zone to find a secret shortcut back to safety brings a wave of comfort. Unfortunately, the inability to warp between these lamps without a layover back to the Hunter\u2019s Dream (your ethereal-feeling home base) is a needless annoyance that exacerbates the issue with the extended load times.  After arriving at a destination, nearly every careful, blood-soaked step through the consistently stunning environments reveals something new about Bloodborne\u2019s vague and cryptic lore. Whispers and clues are everywhere, begging to be interpreted. Despite a frame rate that all too often buckles under the strain of loading new areas or heavy action, the atmosphere retains its full effect. There\u2019s a sense that this strange and dark place is alive. You could find a subtext of criticisms on real-world concepts like faith and worship in the understated dialogue, but taking each outrageously odd story point at face value is the more enjoyable path.  Yet your personal story will be created on your own terms, as you explore the spiderweb of paths and secrets that crisscross Bloodborne\u2019s potent world. Everything is packed with hidden meaning, and spending time speaking with the forgotten citizens of the eerily rotting city of Yharnam yields new ways to interact with the world. At one point, I spoke with a victim of these dark circumstances who gifted me a family heirloom that seemed inconsequential at the time; it wasn\u2019t until I took the time to read its description that it suddenly became a vital tool in a battle to come. Rewards in Bloodborne come with careful examination and curious effort, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.  There\u2019s so much to do and see and try here that I obsessed over finding every secret, which greatly extends Bloodborne\u2019s already lengthy playtime \u2013 though that number can easily be extended in a New Game Plus, or the refreshing procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons . These areas aren\u2019t just more of the same \u2013 they\u2019re loaded with items that can be carried back into the main story, exclusive weapons and bosses, and the player-versus-environment replayability that the Souls series was always missing.  And though Bloodborne is mostly an isolating and solitary experience, subtle cooperative elements enhance that in fascinating ways. Spotting (non-interactive) ghostly shades of other players passing through your area, reading warnings and tips left by people who have come before, and studying reenactments of player deaths by activating prompts on the ground all serve as cautionary tales \u2013 immensely helpful in avoiding surprises that would otherwise leap out and kill you.  Though these features are all mostly identical to their earlier iterations in Dark Souls, some things have improved. The best addition to the messaging system is the inclusion of emotes that spring to life like a hologram when someone reads the message. On the lowest rung of Old Yharnam , in a grimey alleyway corner, I used the available pick-and-choose word selection to lay down the message: \u201citem waits ahead, but beware ambush,\u201d then aimed and added the \u2018point\u2019 emote for a visual indicator to point to where a killer waited in the shadows. According to the rating system, it\u2019s been very helpful to others, and that\u2019s a great feeling. I saved lives.  As far as cooperative multiplayer, Bloodborne is every bit as obtuse as Dark Souls ever was. It allows you to call for help from another player when you need it most, such as a boss fight that feels like a brick wall or a group of enemies you don\u2019t feel confident in taking on alone, by ringing a Beckoning Bell; any players ringing a response bell in the area will warp into your world. The catch (since there\u2019s always a catch in Bloodborne) is that at the same time, you open yourself up to invasion from hostile players that are actively seeking to hunt and kill other hunters. In a rare move of compassion, this time around From has wisely included a password-protected game feature so that you and a friend can connect deliberately, removing some of the ambiguity of anonymous cooperation."

        "Subtitle": "Avengers, assemble your gems!",
        "Content": "A game titled Marvel Puzzle Quest has a lot to live to up to. Not for the Marvel part, but instead due to the deserved respect and love that Puzzle Quest received for successfully creating a hybrid RPG/Bejeweled-style match-three game. Marvel Puzzle Quest has taken the idea of a puzzle game with with a strategic/role-playing element overlay, and turned it into an intricately crafted, remarkably deep experience. Beware fust icons - they do damage over time. In Marvel Puzzle Quest, you control three superheroes who fight against up to three other supervillains/heroes (or goons, in some of the plot missions). When matched, the six colors of gems on the board grant energy that can be used for special moves, like purple matches helping Hawkeye use \u201cTake Aim,\u201d a skill that ensures a critical hit. Every match also serves as an attack, but the amount of damage depends on individual characters' affinity with the color \u2013 which also gives combo attacks a nice superhero fight feel to them, where Iron Man lands a punch and then Black Widow jumps in. Meanwhile, skills that offer buffs to defense/strength, or do damage over time, manifest as changes to tiles on the board, which can be matched and eliminated. Thus, the board becomes amazingly tactical \u2013 there are up to half a dozen potential considerations beyond \u201cbest match\u201d at any given point. These considerations also make each of the characters, and their combinations, much more interesting. The initial three demonstrate how \u2013 Storm has powerful skills, Hawkeye can clean up the board, and Iron Man does high damage and has a lot of hit points, making him a great tank (and who could have even expected a match-three game where having a tank is relevant?). Acquiring more characters and seeing how they work together adds another layer of experimentation, and becomes necessary especially while team members are healing over time.  Marvel Puzzle Quest's strategic layer is just as intricately interconnected as its combat. There are two main modes, story and an asynchronous multiplayer, where you fight against other players' teams being controlled by the AI (the multiplayer must also be the reason that it's always-online). The story is a bare-bones affair, about a powerful new substance called Iso-8 and Norman Osborn's attempts to supplant S.H.I.E.L.D, while there are also a cycling group of multiplayer tournaments to join. These are interconnected like everything else in Marvel Puzzle Quest: you play a few story missions to unlock skills for characters, then play a few multiplayer battles to get the game currency to gain levels for them. This combination of different game modes, ways to upgrade, and forms of currency all fits in with the monetization strategy of the free-to-play Marvel Puzzle Quest. If you're careful about spending your currency, you can play entirely free, although there can be a bit too much repetitive grinding when redoing plot missions. Spending money may be unnecessary, but its time advantages are readily apparent. Storm's sexy stats.",

        "Content": "Write it and they will come. Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure gives you the power to summon almost any hero or villain from DC Comics\u2019 nearly 80-year history to help solve puzzles ranging from simple to deviously clever in this endearing, kid-friendly adventure. Its total freedom to create almost any object or character out of thin air emphasizes that your greatest superpower is your imagination.  Solving puzzles as Maxwell, the Scribblenauts series\u2019 rooster-haired protagonist, tests not only your creativity but your knowledge of the DC universe and its vast array of characters. It doesn\u2019t require that you know the difference between the Golden Age Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel) and the modern android Red Tornado, for example, but familiarity with their existence and powers can enhance your experience exponentially. If a citizen needs medical assistance, why type in \u201cdoctor\u201d when you can summon the sorcerer Doctor Fate instead? (Doctor Mid-Nite works, too.) Extra creativity will be rewarded with more reputation points that can be used to unlock new areas, superhero outfits for Maxwell, and origin stories for DC\u2019s most famous heroes.  In fact, Scribblenauts Unmasked\u2019s database is so packed with DC characters and iconic items - over 2,000 of them - that just browsing through the lot can be daunting. I\u2019ve always considered myself to be a walking repository of useless DC trivia, but Unmasked showed me what a chump I am. There are characters in here so obscure that they may have only ever appeared once in the comics. Some available characters, like lovable rugrats Sugar and Spike, were published by DC Comics but aren\u2019t even a part of its superhero universe. As a hardcore DC fan, I absolutely loved the incredible diversity and staggering breadth of DC toys to play with in this sandbox. (Fun Easter egg: Type in \u201cJim Lee\u201d or \u201cGeoff Johns\u201d and you\u2019ll summon DC\u2019s creative bigwigs.)  That said, there are some odd exceptions. Due to licensing issues, DC\u2019s Milestone comic book characters like Static Shock have been excluded from the fun. The weirdest omission for me was when I needed the perfect hero to counter a villainous rampage by the frigid Killer Frost and attempted to call upon Sun Boy, one of the Legion of Super Heroes\u2019 most prominent members, only to find him missing. The Legion is represented (heck, even L.E.G.I.O.N. is in there - remember them?), but poor Sun Boy got left out. That might sound pretty nitpicky to those of you unburdened by longboxes full of comics cluttering up your closets, but it means something to us geeks!  Of course, in the greater scheme of Scribblenauts Unmasked, a missing character here and there is pretty minor because there\u2019s so much to work with. The appropriately cute story hinges on Maxwell and his sister Lily traveling to the DC Universe, where their world-hopping globe gets broken, releasing all its energizing starites into the hands of super-villains. It\u2019s an excellent excuse for a team-up, as Maxwell meets Batman and joins up with the rest of the Justice League. Bats seems a little too quick to accept help from a preteen interloper with near limitless power for my jaded eyes, but - as is clear from Scribblenauts cutesy art style and presentation - this is a friendly adventure that\u2019s fit for kids and adults alike. Even bloodthirsty killers like Doomsday and Mr. Zsasz are gosh-darn adorable.  Longtime Scribblenauts fans shouldn\u2019t be put off if they're not experts in DC lore. Solving Unmasked\u2019s puzzles, which range from the mundane to the madcap, can often be accomplished through non-superheroic means by modifying an existing object or character in the world with an adjective or summoning a common item. For example, when tasked with helping Commissioner Gordon repair his police car, you can type in \u201cwrench\u201d and give it to him or tap on the car and add the adjective \u201cfixed.\u201d And if there is a puzzle that tests your DC knowledge, such as a request from a citizen to meet a winged hero, the Bat-computer\u2019s database helpfully allows you to scroll around until you spot one (like Hawkman). Unfortunately, the index doesn\u2019t allow you to search by attribute or power, but you can create and share any homemade hero or object with the easy-to-use Hero Creator in the Wii U and PC versions. Also, some adjectives that you might expect to find - like \"toothless\" for defanging a snake - are missing. That one's especially confusing since \"toothed\" is in there.  As you visit iconic destinations like Metropolis, Arkham Asylum, and Atlantis, the complexity level of an area\u2019s puzzles ramps up considerably if you accept a challenge from the magical imp Mr. Mxyzptlk. He\u2019ll set random restrictions such as only being able to use words that start with the letter \u2018N\u2019 or only typing up female heroes. Mxy\u2019s kooky challenges are optional, but following his rules will reward you with double reputation points, and they definitely increase Unmasked\u2019s replayability factor. The downside is that because of the dynamic puzzle system, his restrictions may make some puzzles in an area virtually unsolvable. But that\u2019s the chance you take. And, hey, you can always return later - the puzzles will be different!  The three versions of Scribblenauts Unmasked are virtually identical across the PC, Wii U, and 3DS, with the notable exception that the 3DS doesn\u2019t include the Hero Creator but does have Streetpass support to unlock select hero costumes. Controlling Maxwell is a little bit easier on the Wii U and 3DS due to the D-pad, while the PC\u2019s mouse-based movement proved to be clunkier (though you can also use WASD keyboard buttons, or plug in a gamepad). Targeting a specific character can also be troublesome when several are on screen at once, or obscured by text bubbles or other objects."

Would you kick back, ease off the gas a bit, and set the cruise control? Would you keep the pedal to the metal anyway? Or would you drop the top, start turning down new streets, and see where the open road takes you? NBA 2K13 unquestionably takes the latter path, lacing the latest version of its annual basketball simulation with wild features that, rest assured, take nothing away from the already stellar pro-hoops gameplay. Some of the new additions are great, while others you can live without, but, in the end, 2K13 is the pinnacle of basketball gaming on this generation of consoles. A Court Fit for a King 2K13 has the cajones to mess with its tried-and-true simulation gameplay a bit. The pacing, flow, and feel all remain impeccable. The post-up game is not only playable but enjoyable. The big change is the right thumbstick-based Dribble Stick, which marries the Freestyle controls of last generation\u2019s NBA Live titles with the existing NBA 2K Isomotion control scheme. Shooting is now accomplished by pulling in ZL in combination with a right stick directional press. It certainly takes getting used to given the years of shooting without an additional trigger pull, and odds are you will, like me, occasionally forget and fail to take a wide open shot you meant to attempt. But you\u2019ll eventually get used to it and grow to like the added dribble controls, as they\u2019re not nearly as arcade-y as they were in NBA Live\u2019s heyday, but still add an extra layer of player control to the gameplay. 2K13\u2019s biggest problem \u2013 particularly with the Dribble Stick \u2013 is that none of its new features are explained well, if they\u2019re explained at all. You\u2019re never given a proper tutorial on the critical new dribble moves. Rather, the first time you start up the game, you\u2019re treated to a screen that essentially says, \u201cYou can control your dribble with the right stick now. Wiggle it and see what happens!\u201d So too are Signature Skills practically kept shrouded in secrecy unless you study the list of them in the main menu. Signature Skills assign star players up to several of a couple dozen \u201cplus\u201d traits, be it Corner Specialist (added accuracy when shooting threes from the corners), Finisher (better chance of making shots with defender contact), etc. Because they\u2019re passive and mostly invisible, you probably won\u2019t notice them unless you play MyCareer, where you\u2019ll spend your VC points \u2013 credits earned for anything you do in the game \u2013 to add them to your budding pro baller. Speaking of which, the series\u2019 interface continues to be an archaic, convoluted mess. Some menus can\u2019t be backed out of, while save screens stupidly leave you at the save menu even after you\u2019re done saving \u2013 rather than taking you back to a menu where you can actually do something. Better to enjoy 2K13\u2019s commendable gameplay and suffer through a poorly designed interface than vice versa, but still, how many years has it been like this now? Barkley. Bieber. \u2018Bron. It\u2019s the NBA on NBC! Yes, I did in fact invoke Justin Bieber\u2019s name in the context of a basketball video game review. And it\u2019s not a joke. The teen pop star leads a 2K13 Celebrity team that includes JB Smoove, Bow Wow, and others. They\u2019ve got a ridiculous 97 team rating, and so you can take the 1992 Dream Team \u2013 a glorious addition \u2013 head-on and give them a run for their money, as odd and completely impossible as that sounds. Meanwhile, MyPlayer has taken on a slightly more personal, RPG-like role. It\u2019s as engaging as last year, with your custom baller able to participate in a rookie game, get drafted (complete with a David Stern handshake at the podium), and develop your skills with experience. But now you can even request sit-downs with your general manager, in which you\u2019re free to be good (i.e. compliment the organization) or evil (request that your coach be fired). Your choice of words can be hilarious, and depending on what you say, your standing amongst your teammates, the media, and the fans will be positively or negatively affected. Ah yes, and I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Jay Z \u2013 particularly since his name is in large font on both the front of the box and the main menu title screen. The Brooklyn Nets owner is credited as the game\u2019s executive producer, and, like Bieber, his presence is also not a joke. The soundtrack is of Hova\u2019s choosing, and while I won\u2019t go so far as to say it actively makes the game better, it certainly fits. What does make 2K13 legitimately better is Jay\u2019s pre-game intro packages, which mix music videos with slick gameplay footage to get you hyped up. It works \u2013 these impressively produced segments lend each on-court match an added importance and enthusiasm. Game On The NBA 2K series is also slowly evolving into a virtual hoops museum, too. Not only are NBA Legends teams like Jordan\u2019s dynasty-era Bulls, Magic\u2019s Lakers, Bird\u2019s Celtics, and now Iverson\u2019s 2000 76ers in the game, but so too are both the 2012 gold medal-winning Team USA basketball squad and the original 1992 Dream Team. Even Charles Barkley \u2013 who hasn\u2019t licensed his likeness to a video game since the Sega Genesis days \u2013 signed up. It\u2019s an appealing inclusion, though it begs for a full-blown Olympic tournament mode for both the 1992 and 2012 Summer Games. Even if you ignore 2K13\u2019s weird sideshows and look past its convoluted menus, its core beats with the heart of a champion. With such smooth, realistic gameplay held together by truly astounding presentation \u2013 meaning Jay Z\u2019s intros, the series\u2019 dead-on perfect animations, and note-perfect commentary \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to love and appreciate NBA 2K13 if you have any affinity for pro basketball whatsoever.  So what can you expect on the Wii U? Visually, it\u2019s completely on-par with the already released Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Feature parity is a plus, too, and it\u2019s quite nice \u2013 as with most Wii U games \u2013 to be able to play on the Gamepad screen without the need to turn on your TV at all. The few Wii U-exclusive options are hardly worth double-dipping over if you\u2019ve already bought it for another console, though, and odds are you won\u2019t use them much regardless. Tilt the Wii U Gamepad towards you so that the screen is parallel to your body to activate the \u201cGatorade Biometric Scan\u2122,\u201d which gives you a Predator heat vision-esque look at the players on the court. The redder they are, the hotter they\u2019re shooting, and the more empty their heat map, more fatigued they are (read: time to send them to the bench to rest). Tap on any player from this view to get a detailed look at each hoopster\u2019s physical state. Finally, a tap to the upper right corner of the Gamepad screen brings up some quick coaching options, which only prove more convenient than using the D-pad if you happen to be playing off of the Gamepad screen to begin with. Otherwise, it\u2019s not worth taking your eyes off the TV."

        "Content": "Competition, according to free market economic principles, makes the dueling products better as each pushes to outdo the other. And thus, we consumers are the ultimate winners. But what if your chief \u2013 and really, only \u2013 rival kept finding new and astounding ways to spin out, leaving you as the only car on the road? Would you kick back, ease off the gas a bit, and set the cruise control? Would you keep the pedal to the metal anyway? Or would you drop the top, start turning down new streets, and see where the open road takes you? NBA 2K13 unquestionably takes the latter path, lacing the latest version of its annual basketball simulation with wild features that, rest assured, take nothing away from the already stellar pro-hoops gameplay. Some of the new additions are great, while others you can live without, but, in the end, 2K13 is the pinnacle of basketball gaming on this generation of consoles. A Court Fit for a King 2K13 has the cajones to mess with its tried-and-true simulation gameplay a bit. The pacing, flow, and feel all remain impeccable. The post-up game is not only playable but enjoyable. The big change is the right thumbstick-based Dribble Stick, which marries the Freestyle controls of last generation\u2019s NBA Live titles with the existing NBA 2K Isomotion control scheme. Shooting is now accomplished by pulling in LT/L2 in combination with a right stick directional press. It certainly takes getting used to given the years of shooting without an additional trigger pull, and odds are you will, like me, occasionally forget and fail to take a wide open shot you meant to attempt. But you\u2019ll eventually get used to it and grow to like the added dribble controls, as they\u2019re not nearly as arcade-y as they were in NBA Live\u2019s heyday, but still add an extra layer of player control to the gameplay. 2K13\u2019s biggest problem \u2013 particularly with the Dribble Stick \u2013 is that none of its new features are explained well, if they\u2019re explained at all. You\u2019re never given a proper tutorial on the critical new dribble moves. Rather, the first time you start up the game, you\u2019re treated to a screen that essentially says, \u201cYou can control your dribble with the right stick now. Wiggle it and see what happens!\u201d So too are Signature Skills practically kept shrouded in secrecy unless you study the list of them in the main menu. Signature Skills assign star players up to several of a couple dozen \u201cplus\u201d traits, be it Corner Specialist (added accuracy when shooting threes from the corners), Finisher (better chance of making shots with defender contact), etc. Because they\u2019re passive and mostly invisible, you probably won\u2019t notice them unless you play MyCareer, where you\u2019ll spend your VC points \u2013 credits earned for anything you do in the game \u2013 to add them to your budding pro baller. Speaking of which, the series\u2019 interface continues to be an archaic, convoluted mess. Some menus can\u2019t be backed out of, while save screens stupidly leave you at the save menu even after you\u2019re done saving \u2013 rather than taking you back to a menu where you can actually do something. Better to enjoy 2K13\u2019s commendable gameplay and suffer through a poorly designed interface than vice versa, but still, how many years has it been like this now? Barkley. Bieber. \u2018Bron. It\u2019s the NBA on NBC! Yes, I did in fact invoke Justin Bieber\u2019s name in the context of a basketball video game review. And it\u2019s not a joke. The teen pop star leads a 2K13 Celebrity team that includes JB Smoove, Bow Wow, and others. They\u2019ve got a ridiculous 97 team rating, and so you can take the 1992 Dream Team \u2013 a glorious addition \u2013 head-on and give them a run for their money, as odd and completely impossible as that sounds. Meanwhile, MyPlayer has taken on a slightly more personal, RPG-like role. It\u2019s as engaging as last year, with your custom baller able to participate in a rookie game, get drafted (complete with a David Stern handshake at the podium), and develop your skills with experience. But now you can even request sit-downs with your general manager, in which you\u2019re free to be good (i.e. compliment the organization) or evil (request that your coach be fired). Your choice of words can be hilarious, and depending on what you say, your standing amongst your teammates, the media, and the fans will be positively or negatively affected. On the Xbox 360 side, there\u2019s even Kinect voice support. It proves most useful for substitutions; just say, \u201cBring in Bryant\u201d and you\u2019ll see Kobe get up off the bench and head to the scorer\u2019s table to check in at the next dead ball. I couldn\u2019t, however, get a technical foul called on myself no matter how off-the-handle I flew after a questionable foul call. Ah yes, and I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Jay Z \u2013 particularly since his name is in large font on both the front of the box and the main menu title screen. The Brooklyn Nets owner is credited as the game\u2019s executive producer, and, like Bieber, his presence is also not a joke. The soundtrack is of Hova\u2019s choosing, and while I won\u2019t go so far as to say it actively makes the game better, it certainly fits. What does make 2K13 legitimately better is Jay\u2019s pre-game intro packages, which mix music videos with slick gameplay footage to get you hyped up. It works \u2013 these impressively produced segments lend each on-court match an added importance and enthusiasm. Game On The NBA 2K series is also slowly evolving into a virtual hoops museum, too. Not only are NBA Legends teams like Jordan\u2019s dynasty-era Bulls, Magic\u2019s Lakers, Bird\u2019s Celtics, and now Iverson\u2019s 2000 76ers in the game, but so too are both the 2012 gold medal-winning Team USA basketball squad and the original 1992 Dream Team. Even Charles Barkley \u2013 who hasn\u2019t licensed his likeness to a video game since the Sega Genesis days \u2013 signed up. It\u2019s an appealing inclusion, though it begs for a full-blown Olympic tournament mode for both the 1992 and 2012 Summer Games. Even if you ignore 2K13\u2019s weird sideshows and look past its convoluted menus, its core beats with the heart of a champion. With such smooth, realistic gameplay held together by truly astounding presentation \u2013 meaning Jay Z\u2019s intros, the series\u2019 dead-on perfect animations, and note-perfect commentary \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to love and appreciate NBA 2K13 if you have any affinity for pro basketball whatsoever."

        "Content": "Chrono Trigger is something of a myth for most Australians. It was originally released for the SNES in 1995, but never made it to our shores. In 1999, it was rereleased for the PlayStation with additional content \u2013 specifically, a few cinematics, the ability to listen to the (superb) soundtrack, view the art and other little extras. Again we missed out. Then other games that were given a very similar treatment by Square \u2013 FFIV, V and VI \u2013 began to appear in our local game stores, and for a glimmering, shining moment, we thought we might see this gem too. Alas, it was not to be.  Almost fifteen years after its original release, Square Enix has finally picked up that ball it dropped so long ago, and passed it overseas. For many, this will be their first experience with Chrono Trigger, and they are people to be both envied and forewarned - for although they are lucky enough to experience the magic for the very first time, it has been fifteen years, and the technological gap is something that must be addressed. As such, it is necessary to explain what Chrono Trigger is, before we can discuss the specifics of Chrono Trigger DS.    The game's premise, as spoiler free as possible, is this: Crono , played by you, wakes up on the day of the Millennial Fair \u2013 a celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the Kingdom of Guardia. His mother tells him that his friend Lucca \u2013 a brilliant female inventor \u2013 is already at the fair, waiting for Crono's late (not in a dead way) ass. He hustles his way over, plays some fair games, and ultimately runs into a blonde-haired girl called Marle, inadvertently knocking her to the ground and dislodging her pendant from her neck. He makes it up to her by guiding her around the fair, and eventually the two meet up with Lucca, who wants to display her newest creation \u2013 a teleportation device.  Having never seen \"The Fly\", Crono jumps aboard without hesitation. Sparks fly, things float around, and he is whisked away... five feet to the right. It seems the teleporter works. Naturally Marle wants to try it for herself, and Lucca is more than happy to oblige, but things go awry when her pendant reacts strangely and a massive, swirling, blue gate opens up and sucks her 400 years into the past. Crono jumps back aboard the device and follows after her in the hopes of bringing her back, and what unfolds is a massive tale of time-travel, intrigue, magic and a healthy dose of Japan's big-scary-monster obsession.  Honestly, Chrono Trigger's story is probably its strongest point, and this version \u2013 with rewritten dialogue that is closer to the Japanese original \u2013 really does keep you emotionally involved.  The game tracks your actions in many sequences (the fair especially), and depending on what you do, or even what order you do things in, will alter things later on down the road. Some of these have an effect on which (out of 13!) ending you get. The battle engine is turn-based like much of the Final Fantasy series, however, battles aren't random. Usually Most of the enemies you encounter can be seen on-screen before you initiate battle, and confrontation can sometimes be avoided altogether. Other times, the battle is scripted to start when you walk over a certain area, so you have less time to prepare.   While not the technically most proficient game on the DS, Chrono Trigger still holds up well. It also has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history.  The battles also aren't static. Whereas the usual turn-based RPG battle pits your guys against the enemy like two teams at the start of a soccer match, in Chrono Trigger, your characters are typically sort of scattered, and enemies are constantly moving. This actually has a very large impact on how battles play out, too, because your characters' special attacks (or techs) may affect enemies in a certain radius around you, or around your target, or perhaps it will hit all the targets in a line. This means that, rather than choosing your attack the moment your turn comes up, it may be beneficial to wait until the enemies are clumped together. Thus, Chrono Trigger plays further with the element of time.  Techs come in a few varieties \u2013 single, double, and eventually, triple techs, which involve one, two and three characters respectively. Which techs you learn and which are available for use depend on who you level with and have in your party. It's a pretty simple system, and switching characters in and out to learn all the techniques adds a layer of variety that most other RPGs still lack.   Chrono Trigger DS looks much the same as the original almost a decade and a half ago did. The graphics were considered stellar back then, but having seen what the DS is capable of, it is starting to show its age. It contains the cut-scenes from the PlayStation version (albeit on a smaller screen) and this is perhaps the biggest letdown, because although the cinematics look smooth, the sound is distorted and crackly. It's a real shame, too, because even in those short cut-scenes, the soundtrack stood out.  Luckily, the sound problems are isolated to the cinematics alone, and the rest of the game's stellar soundtrack remains undamaged. Sure, it sounds very MIDI, and there are dozens of DS games out there with better sound quality, but Chrono Trigger's soundtrack is widely considered by game-music aficionados to be one of the absolute best. Listen to the full piece of music in Guardia Forrest, or Zeal, or the Trial, or the Chapel, or dozens of other places, and try to tell us otherwise.  So then what's new? Well, there's the Arena \u2013 a fairly simple little minigame where you choose a monster, give it an item, and tell it to train somewhere (or is that some when ???). Then you go off, play the main game, and come back a while later (or at that same exact moment ???) to find the cute little blob-thing a wee bit stronger. You can then take the beastie and do battle with others for prizes that you can carry back to your main game. The arena battles are all automatically played-out ala FFXII, and the only real input you have is in passing your monster a choice item to hopefully swing things your way. It's not super involved, but it's not really meant to be, either. It's a little distraction that you can partake in when you want a few minutes rest from the main quest.   The inclusion of multiplayer doesn't add much to the experience, but new areas and a new ending add a bit of flavour.  There are also two new areas added to the main game \u2013 the Dimensional Vortex and the Lost Sanctum. Neither of these are particularly game-changing, nor are they particularly stand-out (although they do build on the story and help link Chrono Trigger to its sequel, Chrono Cross ), but they do add some extra life (and an extra ending) to the game.  Lastly, there's the touch-controls, and the use of the second screen. It may not be revolutionary, but having a screen for menus, moves and numbers, and a screen for the graphics helps keep the screen uncluttered. The touch-controls, however, are mostly there \"just because\". 90 percent of the time you'll find it easier to navigate the world and fight battles with the D-pad and face buttons, although it does speed up aspects of menu-navigation.

        "Content": "I must confess it took me a while to get my head around how Valkyria Chronicles works. Much of the blame lies with my own ignorance: before playing I had only the vaguest understanding that it occupied similar SRPG (Strategy Role-Playing Game) territory to the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics (FFT). Once inside the opening tutorial missions however, a critical reassessment was in order. SEGA has instead uncovered the missing link between FFT and -- please bear with me here -- Full Spectrum Warrior; with the characters and aesthetics resembling the former, while the core combat mechanics borrow from the latter. The end result is a beguiling and deep combination of story-driven, turn-based and real-time tactics.  It was the real-time nature of the combat that initially left me bewildered. In a conventional SRPG, when it's your turn it means exactly that: you select your unit then move, attack, heal, cast spells, equip items or whatever you like without having to worry about the enemy intervening. Here, they can. During a selected unit's turn, you move them in real-time from a third-person view a million miles away from the isometric grids common to the genre.  When attacking, the camera zooms in over-the-shoulder and you can flick between auto-locked targets or aim manually to get a headshot. If you move into the enemy's line of sight, they'll shoot you; if you attack them, they can counter-attack. Of course, you're able to return the favour when it's their turn, meaning that effective positioning of your squad -- ensuring you're behind cover (which is often destructible) and facing the right way -- is absolutely critical. And thus the stage is set for an atypically intense, immersive and at times stressful theatre of (SRPG) war.   You named your gun Rosie? Methinks you've been at war too long. Ah well, at least it hasn't mussed up your hair.  The Chronicles of the title refers to the historical account of a war between the East European Imperial Alliance and the Atlantic Federation. Set in the 1930s of a fictitious Europe, this is essentially an alternate history WWII with the Alliance playing the Nazis and the Federation cast as the Allies. The tale unfolds across the pages of a book entitled \"On the Gallian Front\", focusing on the exploits of the Gallian army and militia to defend their tiny nation from attack.  The resource-rich Gallia may be neutral to the conflict, but it swiftly becomes a strategic focal point thanks to an abundance of \"ragnite\", a mineral of considerable power and value. Gallia is also home to Welkin, son of a renowned army general and -- as the lead playable character -- soon to be a military hero himself.  The storybook presentation of the war is a delightful conceit. Each chapter is laid out on a two-page spread with sepia hand-drawn pictures of future events waiting to be coloured in as you progress. And when they do, they literally come to life, leading you into superbly animated cutscenes and -- every now and again -- an actual mission. Although often brief, there are an awful lot of cutscenes here; many chapters will sit you through half a dozen cinematics and conversations before you are able to engage the enemy.   War is hell. In this case it's also very very pretty.  Yet, patient players will be rewarded: the story is quite charming and deftly told despite needing to support a hefty cast of characters each with his or her own journeys to take. Better, the art direction is exquisite, with its watercolour and pencil techniques conveying a pastoral romance to proceedings that contrasts poignantly with the machinery of war. You'll soon grow to adore these breaks between combat.  There's also plenty to actually do away from the frontline. Experience points can be spent on the Training Field to level up the five main characters classes -- and cleverly, all characters of the same class maintain the same level regardless of whether they were used in battle, meaning you never have to grind certain characters to catch up. New weapons and upgrades, as well as a host of modifications to Welkin's command tank, can be purchased from the R&D tent -- and, also cleverly, there's plenty of scope here to personalise your approach given the diversity of upgrades and the scarcity of resources.   Inside the Barracks you can learn more about each character before recruiting them to your squad. In a nice RPG touch, everyone has \"Potentials\", innate abilities that serve as combat bonuses or penalties and do much to inject personality into characters who may otherwise be viewed more as a collection of stats. A particular favourite is Ted, a Scout who both \"Fancies Women\" and \"Fancies Men\", a pair of Potentials conferring a small boost whenever he's fighting alongside either sex. Further, you even have to worry about who likes who, as again more bonuses can be achieved through teaming up different squad combinations.  Once on the battlefield, your tactical repertoire extends to managing 20 characters drawn from the five specialised classes, only some of whom can be deployed at any given moment while the remainder wait in reserve. Fallen units can be rescued by a medic and replaced by a reserve, but you also have the option of retreating any unit and replacing it with one more useful to the task at hand. You might opt to drop your anti-tank Lancers once you've cleared out the enemy tanks, and bring in an extra couple of Shocktroopers to mop up the ground troops. There's a tremendous scope for flexibility, not just in your initial squad selection but to decide its make-up on the fly.  The Command Point (CP) system, wherein the act of selecting a unit for their turn costs you points, provides an extra layer of complexity by not forcing you to move each unit once. Instead, you can sacrifice one unit's turn and let another unit move twice -- or as many times as your CP allows. It's a welcome option and one that will have you pondering the Command Map, weighing up the various CP permutations as you plan your attack.   Move over crates, the next big videogame innovation is here - sandbags!  What's truly gratifying about each battle is that it feels like you emerge victorious because you made some smart decisions and adapted your strategy to the situation. Battlefields start small and confined in the early chapters, but soon open up into expansive fields brimming with tactical opportunity via an assortment of criss-crossing paths, back alleys, sniper towers and various war-torn debris.  What's less impressive is the overt scripting that sees something of a puzzle element creep into play, diluting the otherwise sound strategic base. Often, a scenario relies on catching you out with enemy reinforcements after a set number of turns have passed. On some occasions you'll even see enemy troops essentially wasting their turns (moving pointlessly from one sandbag defence to another and then back again) because their script for this mission isn't to attack you, but rather defend. Ultimately, though, such incidents are a minor blemish and, despite the nagging sense that you're solving the designer's puzzle, accomplishing a mission remains hugely satisfying.  Of course, with XP bonuses on offer for attaining a higher rank completion of each encounter, there's always incentive to replay a scenario and reveal a more efficient method (again betraying that puzzle factor). Elsewhere, you can take your squad into the separate Skirmish mode, which repurposes campaign maps with all-new objectives and pleasingly lets you retain all the XP you earn from completing them. On the flipside, a character killed in a Skirmish will remain dead upon returning to the campaign, giving yet another tactical imperative.   STOP! In the name of the law, before you break my heart. "

        "Content": "We really feel for developers working on first-person shooters these days. It's getting harder and harder to please gamers -- just to keep them interested, let alone surprised or impressed. It's a genre that's awash with me-toos; games that are built on the shoulders of geniuses that aim only to capitalise on a trend or successful predecessor. Then there's a game like Far Cry 2 -- a shooter that really does try and do something new with the formula (and its namesake), giving it a mostly untapped setting and a fresh game structure that actually sidles up closely to an open-world RPG at times.  In the original Far Cry, players were thrown into an idyllic tropical island chain, progressing through lush jungles and dunes and hillsides until the big twist midway through the experience. It was a twist that soured the experience for some players, and it was a divisive decision for the developer too -- should it try something new and risky, or stick with the generic conventions?  Far Cry 2 pushes players into places they've rarely trodden in a traditional action-focussed shooter -- with the exception of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., perhaps. Set in Saharan plains, thick jungles and sandy dunes of Africa, Far Cry 2 immediately stands out from the pack. Africa isn't glamorised here; if anything, it's reminiscent of Edward Zwick's 2006 film, Blood Diamond -- a bunch of satellite shanty communities and hamlets strung together with dirt roads, divided by gang warfare, violence and political upheaval. It's a desperate, dark setting for a game, and you're a gun-for-hire on the heels of The Jackal -- a major reason for the spread of illegal arms sales and the chaos that creates.    So The Jackal is your 'why' -- but more important than this is how you'll find him. The game opens with your character (chosen from a list of character portraits and biographies before you start) in the back of a Jeep, barrelling down a dustbowl stretch of road, driven by an African guide to your contact in the region. The on-rails scenic tour is a great way to introduce you to the environment and story; you pass by groups of armed villagers, tin-walled shanties and over bridges drenched in the noon sun. African Baobab trees dot the plains, while the jungles are draped in vines and arboreal plants, alive with movement and casting some outstanding shadows under the HDR-affected light.  Pretty soon, it becomes apparent that Far Cry 2 tries hard to distance itself from its predecessor -- so much so that we wonder if this wasn't worthy of an all-new brand unto itself. Regardless, you no longer just have your sole pursuit mission guiding you from waypoint to waypoint with naught but a thousand grunts to take down. Rather, being a hired gun, you now work for anyone who can pay your fee -- cashed out in diamonds, since the local dollar has no true value out there. Accept an assignment, get your up-front fee of a few dozen diamonds, get outfitted and you're on your way.  Getting geared up isn't as simple as just grabbing any old gun you find lying around. Well, actually -- it is , but weapons retrieved from the cold, dead hands of your enemies have a nasty habit of malfunctioning, jamming, fizzling or sometimes exploding in your face. Ideally, you need to spend some diamonds on new weapons purchased at one of a handful of weapons stores dotted around the land. After logging onto a delightfully monochromatic PC and flicking through dozens of semi-autos, pistols, rifles, rockets and other things that go boom, you can tweak your purchases with upgrades -- improving stopping power, reload, ammo count, reliability and more.   Lonely Planet didn't tell me about this place. Glad I packed my gun, then.  In practice, malfunctioning weapons are just enough of a hassle to really compel you to get your hands dirty with missions to keep the weapon-sales economy clicking along. Ironically, you're probably just putting more dough into the Jackal's hands directly, since he's a weapons smuggler after all. The other way to procure weapons is from buddies -- meeting up with other private guns in safe houses (which serve as save points). You can also adjust the time of day and therefore light conditions by sleeping in these safe houses.  That's the basic structure behind the game. Of course, things are a little more complicated than that; particularly when you consider the scale of the game -- hundreds of kilometres of roads, paths, grassland and jungles to explore as you please. The main mission dealers come in several forms; three different pro and anti-political factions that dominate the social structure in this faux-African landscape. Representatives of each faction, the APR, the UFLL and the Underground, can be found in so-called 'safe zones' -- towns that enforce a no-gunfire policy within city limits (though, this can be broken if you're feeling particularly bloodthirsty).   Initially, there was some hype surrounding the 'buddy-system' in Far Cry 2. The idea was, you'd go out on a mission and someone you've met along the way would tag along to bail you out if you got into trouble. This is still how it works in practice, though the integration of these characters during combat leaves a little to be desired. For instance, you touch base with a buddy character before each mission, usually by cell phone. They don't ever actively join you in battle unless you're critically wounded -- at which point they inexplicably appear from nowhere and drag you to safety. Then, it's up to you to press forward alone again, since the AI characters don't actually follow you into battle, enter vehicles or do a whole lot of anything, other than occasionally return fire and get themselves into strife. It's a tad disappointing. Also, if a buddy dies, that's it for them. They're kaput. Therefore, unless you really harbour a grudge for the fact that they don't really proactively help you out, it's always a good idea to use a spare Syrette to save their lives.  Hey, at least you get an achievement for your troubles.  The buddy system does open the door to interesting mission design, though. Much of the time, you'll get your primary objective from your client, then en route you can meet up with a buddy who might very well give you an entirely different, game-altering objective. Wanna rip off a cache of gold bars, rather than helping reset the social order? That's an option. A lot of the time, the results are kind of arbitrary -- you'll get a positive or negative reaction from who you're helping or hindering and that's that. But once in a while -- and we won't spoil anything here -- you'll have a far deeper and long lasting impact on the surroundings. Mission structure is a little repetitive though, and that's a bit of a sticking point for the game, unfortunately. While gunfights are fantastic thanks to great AI and environmental effects, mostly you're retrieving, killing, blowing things up and escaping. Those looking for complexity in mechanics should look elsewhere.    In terms of raw shooting mechanics, Far Cry gets it mostly right. The D-pad is your weapons hotkey, the face buttons are reserved for jumping, activating objects, reloading and crouching. All pretty standard stuff. Unfortunately, although the machete is a very effective weapon, there's no dedicated quick-melee as such, and in times of crisis, such as when you're struggling with a jammed rifle or you're out of ammo, there's just no way to slam the butt of your gun into someone's forehead. Instead, you have to actively bring out the machete, which proves more cumbersome in the heat of conflict than it sounds.  Driving mechanics return in fine form, supported by a little Jeep product placement. There are some cool hidden buggies and Hummers to stumble on, and if you work your connections, you can have cool rides delivered to your safe houses, too. However, there's an obvious advantage to simply scavenging for the Jeeps with mounted machine guns that enemy troops use. They're plentiful, relatively sturdy and plenty fast, given the windy, narrow roads and terrain thickly covered in foliage. This devalues special rides, since guns end up being far more important mid-trip than speeding along in a jalopy.  Speaking of trekking by car, Far Cry 2 is damned big for a shooter. Within the 50 square kilometres of jungle, river and desert, there are more than 80 different missions to complete between buddies and the various social and paramilitary groups. Then there are more than 200 diamonds to find hidden throughout the game world in briefcases, trackable using your GPS map system. However, much of the play time is also admittedly spent to-ing and fro-ing from different waypoints on your GPS -- something that players of RPGs like Oblivion and Fallout 3 can appreciate. The legwork is mostly essential -- you need to plough down paths inside a Hummer or other set of wheels if you're to make the best use of your time. There's a bus system between certain points in the land, but just getting to these depots takes time.   *insert your own explosion sound effects here*  No loading while you're travelling around is a bit of a half-truth. While we definitely think that Ubisoft Montreal mostly got the monumental task of landscape streaming right, and the draw distance and detail level is consistently very good, there is a fair amount of pop-in that occurs when travelling at speed or when turning corners around cliff-faces or in ravines. There were even a couple of instances where whole enemy-occupied settlements would pop-in as we were speeding around a bend, leaving us exposed and vulnerable to gunfire from all sides.  Still, it's impressive and, importantly, fun, to grab a hang glider and leap off a tall point, swooping under the tree line and careening into the tangerine afternoon sky. Truly, this is a game that rewards experimentation too, from that end. Using a glider to gain higher ground, you can turn a confrontation to your favour by playing with enemy AI; scouting out key landmarks with your spotter-lens before sniping from a distance and gliding back down to ground level.  It's funny, but you really begin to value those moments of quiet exploration between battles. They're so infrequent that you sometimes feel like you're constantly in someone's crosshairs -- which is fine to a point, but in a game that requires you to do so much raw travel between points, it does get tiring. A major reason for this is that enemies unfortunately respawn in any area you return to -- regardless of how efficiently and thoroughly you've cleared it. On one hand, the argument is that a shooter could get mighty boring without plenty of enemies to be fought all times. But on the other, you never feel like you're making a dent on the enemy numbers. What's the point of stopping and shooting when you know they'll just respawn anyway? A better compromise would've been a semi-permanent peace-zone in regions you've cleared, as there are in the main towns. Perhaps gang wars and militias might require you to push back their presence, but as it is, you'll be under fire almost constantly.   The engine powering Far Cry 2's graphics is something of a lighting and effects marvel, sporting the best, most convincing use of high dynamic range lighting we've seen. The shadows are black, the harsh midday sun washes the colours out of reflective surfaces and your 'eyes' do adjust and react naturally between indoor to outdoor transitions. Wind rustles the individually rendered blades of grass, spreading the propagating fire effects onto anything that can burn until all the fuel is spent. Rain pours down, the tree branches animate individually, can be shot to pieces, burnt and blow up. Buildings have a fair degree of destructibility too; lob a grenade into a iron-clad shanty and the planks and panels will blow far into the sky. Propane tanks become stationary flamethrowers if you puncture them in a few places, while ammunition caches go apesh*t if you set them alight.  The result of all this attention to detail is a game that immediately impresses on the surface, but genuinely has gameplay altering depth to the engine to back it up. Daylight fighting is a totally different experience to the challenges of near pitch black night fights, for instance. Using physics and environmental layout to your advantage is always an option, as is corralling the enemy with fire or startling a herd of zebras into their path. The only place the engine disappoints is in the aforementioned pop-in, which does spoil the illusion of immersion from time to time. Other than that, watching your character dig bullets out of his hand with a knife or blowing oil canisters into the air never gets old. Very impressive.    The voice acting and sound work also rightly deserve a separate mention. It's a delight to hear a cast of African (or imitation African) voices in a game set in this country, rather than some shoehorned American actors filling in the roles. The quality is consistently excellent, and the AI is reactive and intelligent enough to chatter to each other appropriately during firefights, depending on how you're playing. The environment is filled with the chirping of birds and insects, the rustling of leaves and rush of flames as it engulfs the landscape; all of this is offset by tribal drums and occasional thumping rock that fades in and out depending on the level of action on screen.  Two other aspects complete the Far Cry 2 package -- both fairly well realised and certainly increasing the game's longevity considerably. The first is the map editor -- selectable from the front menu in the Map Community option. The editor itself is very robust, offering a radial menu that takes you through every aspect of the map creation process. And what a process it is. There's no tutorial as such -- just a lot of symbols, trial and error. Thankfully, people who invest more than a few minutes into learning how to adjust the landscape, weather the surface, texture, colour, foliage, objects, water level, lighting, weather and scale will discover about the best console map editor out there. It really is impressive -- but community-oriented features such as this really live or die by the community itself embracing them, and the jury is out on that one.   Genocide and attrocities for everyone, thanks to the wonders of online multiplayer.  Still, with just about every single object from the single player game at your disposal in the editor, the potential for creative map design is evident. You can't create your own rules or game modes, however. Instead, you must choose one of the four game types available in multiplayer -- which we'll delve into now.  For gamers spoilt for great online shooters, here's another one to add to the list. In addition to standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, Far Cry 2 also introduces 'Capture the Diamond' (take a guess on how that one works) and more interestingly, 'Uprising'. Uprising is easily the most interesting of the four modes, pitting teams with a captain each against each other. You must support your captain as he captures each checkpoint before heading off and assassinating the opposing team's captain. It's tricky and really requires some serious team work to succeed. Whether such a thing is possible over an anonymous Xbox Live or PSN game is another question entirely. "

        "Content": "This has been a hard review to write. Not because I don't know what to say, but because every time I dip back into Satisfactory to look up an item name or confirm some detail, I find myself checking in on the state of my workshop, just for a moment, and then several hours have suddenly flown by. That\u2019s the magic of this seemingly benign, inexplicably alluring factory simulator. Whether I\u2019m pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot a problem on the factory floor or running away from very disrespectful fireball-spitting aliens, every moment spent on this beautifully complex world has been rewarding. Combining the creativity and exploration of Minecraft with the spreadsheet-inducing planning and optimization of Factorio, Satisfactory is not only the best game I\u2019ve played this year, but my favorite automation game of all time \u2013 and after over 130 hours, when I finally rejoiced amid a rat\u2019s nest of machines after besting the most daunting of engineering demands, I felt a sense of achievement unlike any other. Even if you\u2019re skeptical of mercilessly intricate builders, this one stands far above the crowd. Satisfactory is an immediately compelling factory simulator where you and up to three friends are dropped on an alien planet and told you need to establish a base and produce increasingly complicated materials, then launch them into outer space to appease your faceless employer, FICSIT Inc. In order to do so, you\u2019ll need to harvest natural resources, develop new technologies, and become a master of conveyor belts, pipelines, and eventually even locomotive operations as you triumphantly grow your tiny headquarters into a sprawling labyrinth of moving parts. There isn\u2019t much in the way of story, but the thin veil of its \u201csave humanity by building factories\u201d premise served as reason enough to keep my head in production plans \u2013 plus there are a few good jokes along the way, like how your AI assistant constantly reminds you just how expendable you are. More and more is asked of you as you progress, and what starts out as a simple process of gathering leaves and mining iron to make basic tools quickly spirals into a convoluted whirlwind of refineries, manufacturing plants, nuclear power grids, and even reality-bending alien technologies that will produce everything from computer chips to interdimensional storage containers.

But in the same way that something like No Man\u2019s Sky gives you a ton of creative freedom while providing irresistible goals to chase along the way, Satisfactory never stops providing exciting new reasons to keep playing. I cannot fathom the number of times I promised myself I\u2019d log off after I tweaked just one more thing only to find myself still tinkering away hours later. Each breakthrough moment, like figuring out how oil refineries work so you can start the production of plastic, organically leads to the next mountain to climb, like crafting a rifle and producing ammo with the byproducts of said refineries. Before you know it, you hear those morning chirps from birds outside your window and realize you might have made a mistake. Satisfactory does an absolutely stellar job of nudging you to take small, manageable steps. \u201c Managing ever-more-complex factories can be pretty intimidating at times, but Satisfactory does an absolutely stellar job of nudging you to take small, manageable steps with its checklist of projects to tackle, and in no time at all you and your friends are managing sprawling operations that would have seemed unfathomable at the start. The earliest factory I built began as a few buildings scattered about the untainted wilderness, which rapidly devolved into a horrendous and disorderly web of nonsensically crisscrossing conveyor belts that looked like a bowl of wet noodles (naturally, I dubbed the settlement Spaghettysburg). That amateurish anarchy might be unintuitive and less than optimal, but hey, it gets the job done, and I victoriously delivered my eminent Spaghettysburg address to my co-op partners as we launched the fruits of our labor into space amid the mess of mechanical pasta.

The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve as you solve progressively more difficult engineering challenges, such as optimizing and expanding your power grid to fuel newly unlocked facilities that can produce more complicated parts, or running the math on the ideal ore output of a mining rig to figure out the most efficient way to smelt it into ingots. And you don't have to be a spreadsheet geek like me or dive deep into third-party wikis to simply see a conveyor belt full of unused materials backing up and feel the irresistible urge to do something about it. The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve as you solve progressively more difficult engineering challenges. \u201c As you\u2019re required to make dozens of different components and juggle a large number of demanding processes in order to complete the Milestone deliveries that make up Satisfactory's larger progression, you\u2019re constantly switching to wherever your attention is needed most, solving problems and using the new technology you create along the way to make your life easier. For example, early on, I built comically long conveyor belts to move resources from other parts of the world to my main factory, but after unlocking additional options and manufacturing more advanced parts, I was able to automatically transport resources with trucks, trains, and even flying drones, making things faster, cleaner, and frankly, less chaotic in the process. Going from an unwashed, melee-swinging, conveyor belt-abusing troglodyte to a jetpacking, gun-toting man of tomorrow is immensely satisfying, and makes each hard-fought battle of electrical wiring well worth the trouble.

Continue playing See results When you\u2019re not juggling the hundreds of things to do with your factory operations, you\u2019ll take to a vast open world to explore the map, battle beasties, evade poison gas and irradiated zones, find hidden treasures, and befriend gross-looking lizard doggos to serve as your loyal companions. Opting for a single, impressively hand-crafted world instead of the more common procedurally generated areas found in some of its peers, Satisfactory\u2019s map has a diverse set of regions with their own vibes and valuable resources to plunder that are awesome to explore and even better to colonize with your hungry machines. As you gain access to new tools, you\u2019ll get better equipment to take out into exploration, which then gives you access to even more areas. For example, crafting a gas mask lets you navigate zones overrun with poisonous clouds, unlocking the jetpack allows you scale cliffs that would otherwise be difficult to climb, and researching explosives allows you to blast through troublesome rocks so you can delve into caves and other blocked off areas. Each of these developments completely changes what\u2019s possible while out in the world, which in turn allows you to acquire better materials to bring back to your base, creating a loop of building and exploration that just doesn\u2019t quit. Combat clearly isn\u2019t the intended focus of Satisfactory. \u201c Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be much of an alien planet if there weren't hostile critters who are quite interested in seeing your violent demise \u2013 be that boar-like creatures who charge at you or large glowing plants that spit out stinging fireflies. You\u2019ll unlock a few melee weapons and some basic guns and ammo, but combat clearly isn\u2019t the intended focus of Satisfactory, and it isn\u2019t anything special as a result. It only took me a few hours before I realized I\u2019d seen just about everything combat had to offer, and while it\u2019s not actively bad, it\u2019s just a bit forgettable when the building and exploration are so great. The alien wildlife provides a touch of danger whenever you go looking for new resources, but it's still a bit disappointing that there only seem to be four types of creatures to encounter, each with a few different variations that make them more deadly but not any more interesting to fight. TieGuyTravis' Favorite Games That Are Way Too Complicated Sometimes it just feels good to sweat all over your keyboard with beautifully convoluted mechanics. These are the best games to play if that mood strikes you.

Not only does building with friends allow you to get things done more quickly and bounce ideas off one another, but you can each take off to a different part of the map and still work towards shared goals by building infrastructure to transport goods and players from place-to-place. One especially cool aspect is that, once you unlock supernatural alien technology that defies the laws of physics (which happens surprisingly early rather than being wasted on the endgame alone), you can begin sharing resources with one another remotely by uploading your bounty to the Dimensional Depot, which anyone can then pull items from at any time. This creates a really cool dynamic, where a player you haven\u2019t seen in the world for several hours can pipe up to ask for help with something, and you can virtually hand them the resources they need to solve their problem. If there\u2019s one real issue with Satisfactory, it\u2019s that sometimes its ambition exceeds its grasp, leading to a pretty steady stream of obnoxious performance issues and bugs. Crashes were a regular occurrence for my crew, especially for those joining my world for multiplayer, and as your factory grows to an absurd size and complexity, you\u2019ll start to see pop-in, weird textures, and framerate dips with increasing frequency. I played on three separate PCs of varying levels of power for this review, and though each could run Satisfactory fine at the outset, by the end only my Ryzen 9/RTX 4090 system could run it without at least moderate issues. You\u2019ll likely need a fairly powerful rig to run this one with true consistency \u2013 but the good news is that even when it was struggling, those problems were only ever an annoyance rather than anything so severe that they made us want to stop playing."

And while I've certainly had a bit of a love-hate relationship with it, I think I can confidently say that The War Within represents the best it's ever been. From the story, to the environments, to the music, to the new features, this is WoW firing on all cylinders. The biggest improvement, philosophically, is that Blizzard seems to actually want everyone to get to see the whole expansion this time around. As someone who began my journey with this series in Warcraft II and is very invested in the story, but doesn't really like to interact with randos and doesn't have any friends left who still play this game from the group I started out with in 2004, this has never previously been the case. Every IGN World of Warcraft Review 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask All the juicy plot stuff was locked behind either joining an endgame guild, which can be like a part-time job, or queueing for pick-up-groups which, let's be honest, has almost always been a terrible experience, and I don't even know if it's fixable. Random groups always want to finish a dungeon as fast as possible. If there's a dumb shortcut where you have to jump across a one-pixel ledge to skip one pull, they expect you to do it. And they assume everyone should have already studied every mechanic in every boss fight before even attempting it, ruining any surprises if it's your first time through. It's kind of a rancid culture, and WoW's game design has unintentionally encouraged it. In contrast, the first time I ran through one of The War Within's follower dungeons, which let you take in the story solo at your own pace with a group of NPC helpers, I am not playing it up to say I almost cried. As a type of player who feels like they've been left behind for twenty years, this is the most listened to I've ever felt by these devs. It's not just the repeatable follower dungeons, either. Some of the five-man instances even have a separate, tailored story version with tweaked mechanics and bosses that you play through with important lore characters at your side, and you might even be treated to a well-produced cutscene at the end. As a type of player who feels like they've been left behind for twenty years, this is the most listened to I've ever felt by these devs. \u201c I can't overstate how much World of Warcraft is completely transformed for me now that, if I see something cool on the wall of a dungeon that an artist worked really hard on, I can stop and look at it for as long as I want and I don't have to worry about four other people getting mad at me. I can pause and casually read through a boss's journal entry when I get to them, instead of having to spoil the entire instance before I even go in by familiarizing myself with fights I haven't seen yet. If I do want to eventually run with other people, I can practice these fights on my own, as many times as I want, without ever getting yelled at or wasting anyone else's time. I can get up in the middle of a dungeon to make a sandwich, or use the restroom, or take the dog for a walk, or go get a beer at the bar. I'm living every Hunter's dream: pulling every trash group when I feel like it and knowing the tank will happily just go along with whatever I want and make it work. Because she's not real. I'm the main character. Also Azeroth's favorite princess, and the most interesting girl in the world. This is, simply put, a vastly more enjoyable way to play a video game for me. And it might be the biggest step WoW has taken forward design-wise in the two decades I've been playing it. They're even adding a story mode for raids in a later patch, and while I'm a little bit disappointed it will only feature the final boss instead of the whole instance, at least it will let you see the goddamn ending. In almost every previous expansion, I've had to look that up on YouTube, which is absurd considering I paid for the whole expansion. I think the main reason I didn't like Dragonflight as much as a lot of longtime WoW players did, is that it was an expansion for people who already liked what WoW has always been. The War Within is an expansion for people like me, who have always wanted to love the endgame but never quite could. For people who adore these characters and this world, and may have bonded with them back when they were introduced through a single-player RTS, but don't have the ability or desire to weave a raid schedule into all of our other responsibilities or put up with the stressful, fun-ruining ordeal of pick-up groups. The blatant catering to my playstyle continues with Delves, the new solo dungeons that are meant to be something of an alternative to raids and Mythic+ in the endgame. They feature the same kinds of silly and ridiculous temporary power-ups I adored from Torghast, including one that gives you a double jump and another that greatly increases your damage as long as you never fall below half health. If Torghast has only one fan, it is me. If Torghast has no fans, then I am gone from this Earth. So it's great to see some of the things that worked about it coming back. Delves get really, satisfyingly hard at the highest tiers. \u201c One Delve I played has what are effectively the jump mushrooms from Sonic the Hedgehog, allowing you to explore vertically in a new way, and another features wall-mounted ledges you can zip up to with a grappling hook. They get really, satisfyingly hard at the highest tiers, too \u2013 though I think certain mechanics, like unavoidable AoEs that can one-shot less tanky characters are a bit annoying, since they're purely a gear check and don't care about player skill. But clawing my way up the gear ladder to the point that I could do high-level Delves more comfortably felt extremely rewarding. I pushed myself to the limit and took on something that was intended for players well above my item level, got better gear, and was able to then do it more comfortably. This is what top-level content should feel like. At least, that's how it works in theory. As I'm writing this, Blizzard just pushed a hotfix that broke scaling in high-level Delves for everyone and made them almost impossible to complete. And this is only one of many bugs I've encountered. Unfortunately, this isn't a highly polished endgame experience. From missing voice lines in some cutscenes to max-level world quests with spawn rates so low, they have flocks of players circling the area on flying mounts like condors and rushing in to fight over one objective, there's a lot that feels like it could have used more testing once you hit 80. Some or all of this may be resolved by the time you're reading this, but I think it's important to point out that the state it\u2019s in around launch is disappointing. Calling All Hunters On the class design side, obviously I can't speak to every specialization as a single human being with limited time on this Earth. But I can speak quite intimately to the Marksmanship Hunter, which has been my main spec since 2018's Battle for Azeroth. And we're lucky in that I don't think we've ever been really let down by the devs, at least since I joined the archery team. The reason I've stuck with it so long is that it's consistently one of the most fun and thematically cool specs in WoW, and The War Within isn't an exception. The fundamentals are still strong. As for our hero talents, I've tried out both the night elf-themed Sentinel and the tortured soul, Sylvanas-inspired Dark Ranger, and I'm not in love with either one yet. Dark Ranger is the stronger of the two thematically, and if you've always wanted to play as Sylvanas, I think it scratches that itch really well. But it adds a new single-target attack, Black Arrow, which honestly makes the rotation just a little too complicated for my taste. The 20th Anniversary patch later this year is tying it to Kill Shot and also making Precise Shots a single-charge ability, which I think are great changes to streamline the rotation. But for now, it can be a lot to juggle. Sentinel doesn't add any new attack buttons, but rather relies on passive effects that change how I think about my existing ones. So far, so good. In theory, that's exactly what I'd like hero talents to do. And the capstone, Lunar Storm, puts a sparkly circle at your target's feet when you cast Rapid Fire that increases your damage toward anything inside of it. This has been a template for endgame Marksmanship abilities in previous expansions, and overall I think it works great. You call out an area and say, \"I'm going to kill those fools right over there.\" The issue with Lunar Storm is that it's tied strictly to Rapid Fire, and the area it creates is fixed to wherever the target was standing the moment you used it. This gives me very little control over where that area of increased damage is going to be. It's basically going to end up wherever my target happened to be standing when Rapid Fire came off cooldown, because it's rarely worth it to delay casting Rapid Fire to position Lunar Storm better. That can be a noticeable DPS loss, and it's assuming that there's even an enemy you can tag in an ideal spot anyway. What feature in The War Within are you most excited about? Delves Warbands Earthen Allied Race Story Mode Raids New Zones Xal'atath Hero Talents Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results I can't plan ahead and place it where I know my target is going to be in a few seconds to maximize its effect. It also doesn't come with the multitarget utility of my beloved Faerie Death Circle from Shadowlands, which allowed me to entirely ignore the idea of having a separate talent build for trash fights. I'll never forget you\u2026 I know I said I didn't want more buttons. And you could say that Lunar Storm's inflexibility increases the skill ceiling for the spec, which is generally a good thing in my opinion. But in this case, it's only in the same way that using toothpicks instead of chopsticks would increase the skill ceiling of eating a bowl of noodles. It's kind of disappointing and annoying, and I don't find that it leads me to making interesting tactical decisions. It works great in boss fights where the boss stands still for long periods of time, and in no other situations. As the lesser of two evils, I kind of do wish Lunar Storm had its own button, and I could place the area wherever I wanted. In a perfect world, maybe it would just replace an existing targeted area ability like, say, Binding Shot, and add that utility to its effects. Okay, if you don't play Marksmanship Hunter, you can rejoin us now. Whatever class you play , the new Warband system is excellent. \u201c As for the other classes I play, Retribution Paladin is also in a good place. The auto-attack haste build has never been more hilarious, for if you really don't want to push any buttons at all. I've been leveling a Resto Shaman for the first time since Cataclysm, and I haven't gotten into a good groove with it yet, but I also haven't hit 80 to try out their hero talents. Arcane Mage, if I'm honest, isn't where I'd like it to be this time. Fans of damage meters should have no issues, since they're doing great DPS, but as much as I don't mind them being the \"PhD spec,\" I don't think you should need a PhD just to optimize DPS when so many other classes can do comparable or better numbers with their far less complex rotations. In my mind, the big brain theming and high skill ceiling of Arcane should be expressed in its utility. I want to be like Doctor Strange, using teleportation and crowd control and time travel to make ingenious plays that don't purely rely on big damage numbers. Whatever class you play though, the new Warband system is excellent, including a shared bank between all characters on the same realm, and shared reputation tracks for all of The War Within's factions. Setting the Stage If you missed the big announcement last BlizzCon, The War Within is intended as the first part of a trilogy of expansions that aim to tell a larger, complete story. This is something WoW has never done before, and I'm pretty excited about it. Without spoiling too much, the first hour of that story definitely feels like we're going full speed ahead into something sweeping and epic. Some major sacred cows in the lore are actually on the chopping block (not literally \u2013 Baine is fine, don't worry). And Xal'atath is a compelling new nemesis. The first of The War Within's zones, the verdant and picturesque Isle of Dorn, which exists on the surface just above where the other 80 percent takes place, feels very familiar to a long-time WoW player in a lot of the same ways the Dragon Isles did. And basically all of the best features from Dragonflight are back. You get Skyriding (what used to be called Dragonriding) almost immediately, which I'm still conflicted about just because I think exploring new zones for the first time on the ground gives you more of a sense of place and grandeur. But I'm not conflicted at all about the return of thrilling aerial race courses and the fantastic expanded profession system. Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls.

It's also quite a bit more organized and easier to navigate than the sometimes disorienting vertical layout of Valdrakken. Though performance has gotten pretty rough around here, at least during peak times, even on my 4070 Super. Down below, the Ringing Deeps is maybe the least impressive zone so far, with a theme that could best be described as \"big cave.\" But that's only in comparison to the Isle of Dorn and the show-stopping Hallowfall. I know people throw around poetic words like \"breathtaking\" a lot. But what I want to stress to you is, when I saw Hallowfall for the first time, I actually stopped breathing for a couple seconds at least. It might be the most unique, awe-inspiring zone Blizzard has ever designed, with a complete underground sea stretching out into the misty depths, beneath a colossal crystal embedded in the cavern's ceiling that serves as a subterranean sun. The scale of it is hard to get my head around. The War Within has some of my favorite WoW music since Wrath of the Lich King. \u201c Going even further down the rabbit hole, Azj'Kahet, the seat of Nerubian power, is like a whole other capital city, and the game board for a fascinating spy thriller power struggle that evokes some of the best parts of Suramar from Legion. The way the entire expansion is designed is kind of a photo negative of Dragonflight, in which you were slowly climbing the island to get to Thaldraszus at the top. Each of The War Within's zones takes you deeper into the bowels of Azeroth, which gives it some of the effective feel of a classic dungeon crawler. And the music! I can easily say The War Within has some of my favorite music in WoW since, dang, Wrath of the Lich King maybe? Since Blizzard\u2019s composers always kill it with their orchestral excellence, it's really something when they release this many tracks that stand out even by their high standards. Lorecraft Just like Dragonflight, the smaller zone quests are often memorable and touching. I think the one everybody's going to be talking about this time involves one of the semi-immortal Earthen realizing that his mind is starting to deteriorate, and asking you to help him set his affairs in order as he plans to end his own life instead of undergoing a hard reset to continue his duties without any of his prior memories. I never get tired of being reminded that, for all the world-shaking, high-fantasy shenanigans driving World of Warcraft at the plot level, these kinds of heartfelt and relatable tales are what actually make it special. As far as the plot is concerned, there have been plenty of exciting and significant moments already. I've enjoyed adventuring with Dagran Thaurissan II, the boss's kid who insisted on coming with you to the war, and who clearly shouldn't be here, but that's an argument I didn't have the time or energy for so now I just have to make sure he doesn't die. I was worried about Alleria Windrunner, who has been one of my favorites since she first appeared in Warcraft II. The whole edgelord vengeance thing has been done so many times before, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the writers have made her very much her own person, and chosen to highlight what makes her different from her sister Sylvanas instead of retreading tired tropes. What we said about World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Dragonflight reignites the sense of wonder and exploration that originally drew me to World of Warcraft, for about the first 30 or 40 hours. Beyond that, it definitely starts to feel a bit threadbare. Dragon riding is fun as hell, and I love the design of the new zones. But this expansion's back-to-basics approach is very much a double-edged sword. I probably won't burn out as fast because there aren't a million things to do every day just to feel like I'm keeping up like there were in Shadowlands. But at the same time, I don't feel like there's enough to do that's genuinely interesting once I've cleared all the very well-written side quests. An excellent new crafting system is gated behind mind-numbing amounts of mindless grinding for resources, in addition to weekly caps, which feels like a double jeopardy situation. I like Dragonflight, but I fell out of love with it not long after hitting max level. I really hope Blizzard looks at this as a rebuilding year for WoW, and doesn't hesitate to iterate on some of the inventive ideas in Shadowlands that were maybe only a step or two away from being great. - Leana Hafer, December 15, 2022 Score: 7 Read the full World of Warcraft: Dragonflight review . As much as I adore the new solo content, the group stuff is pretty strong this time around, too. The five-man dungeons, overall, are a step up from Dragonflight, which I thought played it a bit too safe and delivered some unmemorable adventures. There are a couple duds like that. The Rookery \u2013 which, to be fair, is the introductory dungeon \u2013 is about as simplistic as modern WoW dungeons get. There are some that took big risks and maybe didn't stick the landing: The Dawnbreaker is a swashbuckling action movie that has you flying between different airships, and while I think it's a bit janky in execution, I would always prefer them to try new stuff like this rather than play it safe. Then you have some that hit just the right spot. Cinderbrew Meadery comes to mind, where one fight requires your group to serve drinks to angry patrons or they'll pound on the tables harder and harder to deal AoE damage to the whole group. Not every boss in every dungeon is unique or exciting, but there are plenty that are. I really like the pacing of the endgame season so far. \u201c The raid, Nerub-ar Palace, is a satisfying capstone to the Queen Ansurek storyline with some tricky but not overly annoying bosses. The vibes and area design are creepy and epic. Even on Raid Finder, the encounters don't feel like totally mindless DPS races. This extends even to normal difficulty dungeons, too, where it seems like Blizzard has opted to include less punishing versions of mechanics you'll see on Heroic and Mythic from the very start instead of surprising you with new stuff as you climb the progression ladder. Instead of going, \"What is that?\" you'll be going, \"Oh, I've seen this mechanic before, but it's killing me a lot faster now.\" And that makes the learning process so much smoother. I also really like the pacing of the endgame season so far. It feels like there's just enough for me to do without ever feeling like I have to put in dozens of hours a week to maximize my progression. Eight max-level Delves will give you three pieces of vault gear that are basically equivalent to what can drop in a Heroic raid, which is much more generous than I was expecting. And the refresh rate on daily quests means that if you want to log in once a day, you can clean up your map in about 20 minutes, or play for an hour or so every three days, which is just about right."

        "Content": "Editor's Note: This review takes a fresh look at Fortnite in 2024, replacing our previous review from 2018 . You can read more about our review policies and philosophy here . It\u2019s wild to think about how much of gaming culture over the last decade has been defined, at least in part, by Fortnite. This is a game that began humbly before expanding wildly into a juggernaut of an online sandbox, where somehow Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender can crash a sports car into a Stormtrooper outpost before popping out and shooting Family Guy\u2019s Peter Griffin with a neon assault rifle and then gliding away on a Cacodemon from Doom. But despite the absurdity of that sentence, Fortnite isn\u2019t just a collection of branded cardboard cutouts scattered throughout a cartoony island: It\u2019s managed to grow to this level because it\u2019s also an enduringly fun battle royale shooter, and its momentum has been built on by season after season of updates that go all-out to pull you back in right when you thought you were done. Whether you\u2019re playing in Fortnite\u2019s signature mode that allows you and up to 99 others to mine resources and then magically build structures like ramps and walls for cover on the fly, or the more traditional building-free battle royale mode that\u2019s all about smooth moving, punchy shooting, and fun vehicles, its bounty of extra objectives, smattering of NPCs and named locations, and in-game missions set it a cut above other games in the genre. Each match starts even before the Battle Bus drops you from the sky, as you pick out a quest from dozens of different missions and objectives that infuse each of the roughly 15-minute rounds with extra purpose and direction. Maybe you want to take care of some daily missions to jump a few levels ahead in your battle pass, or maybe you want to find a specific NPC like Centurion, who can help you in battle by either selling you powerful weapons and healing items or squadding up with you to help stack up some eliminations and chase the number one spot. Fortnite Gameplay Screenshots (2024) 65 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Regardless of where you choose to land on the island or why, Fortnite\u2019s mission structure cleverly guides you towards engaging with its large, interestingly laid-out map by peppering locations and quests throughout the island and naturally encouraging you to discover things off the beaten path as you run, drive, or glide from objective to objective. Stumbling upon a character who can help you hide or a vault with extra gold that you can use to buy items and services from NPCs is more rewarding than simply running to find loot and staying alive the longest within an ever-shrinking safe zone. When you land, your priorities might immediately be influenced by a mission or even a randomly selected match quest, which prompt you to do weird things like emote at a named location or eliminate an opponent with a specific type of weapon in order to earn experience points for your battle pass. Of course, the catch is that everyone else is trying to kill you as you do this, so you have to balance it with the task of gearing up with a healing item and guns. Naturally, everyone knows the best of those items will be at defined spots like The Underworld or Doomstadt\u2026 and the fact that people know this makes those landing zones riskier to explore because you\u2019re all but certain to run across others straddling the line between brave and stupid, which leads to scrappy, no-holds-barred showdowns. But Fortnite lets you play it safe as well, so if you prefer to land somewhere less contentious you\u2019ll still be able to find weapons and other helpful tools like shield potions off the beaten path. Epic isn\u2019t afraid to mix the balance up with more creative ideas. \u201c Either way, few players will have a fully stocked and organized arsenal at this point, making these early moments especially tense and tough unless you beat others to a treasure chest or good weapon that tips the odds in your favor. Sometimes that weapon isn\u2019t immediately available \u2013 I\u2019ve landed at a hotspot only to have to slowly chip away at an opponent\u2019s health and shields with my pickaxe before I even got the chance to loot anything plenty of times. This exchange of blows is a lot slower than the gunslinging Fortnite usually expects from you, but it\u2019s not so much bad or boring as it is a goofy byproduct of you and your opponent looking each other dead in the eye after realizing you\u2019re both out of options and hoping you come out on top. Thankfully, weapons are plentiful on the island, with several types designed for different situations stashed in every chest and building. The main guns are pretty typical: Assault rifles are reliable in most skirmishes, but less useful in a close-quarters encounter than a shotgun or submachine gun would be. Alternatively, the DMR and sniper rifle outpace all of those in long-range combat. However, Epic isn\u2019t afraid to mix the balance up with more creative ideas, and so it also includes a ton of cool one-off weapons themed after its many regular events. For example, during the annual Star Wars event for May The 4th you can wield Stormtrooper blasters, Chewbacca\u2019s bowcaster, and even a lightsaber if you get lucky and find one randomly on the map or defeat a formidable Darth Vader NPC. How often do you play Fortnite (battle royale)? All the time! Somewhat regularly I dip back in around new seasons or events I used to play but don't really anymore I don't play Fortnite at all Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results These days, a nearly non-stop rotation of different crossovers bring new types of mythic weapons and tools to the table, with several additions being made specifically for one season or event before being shelved indefinitely. Logging in on a random day could land you something as silly and mundane as Peter Griffin\u2019s Pump Shotgun (which is just a normal shotgun that deals extra damage) or as useful as the explosive Kamehameha from Dragon Ball Z and the deadly and accurate power of Waterbending from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Even when they\u2019re especially powerful, event items and weapons are easy to come by, meaning you\u2019re a lot less likely to lose to another player just because they had a super-powered weapon that your normal gun couldn\u2019t compete with \u2013 that includes this season\u2019s Marvel-themed pickups like Doctor Doom\u2019s Gauntlets, which let you pelt opponents with powerful blasts of energy, or last season's jet-powered Nitro Fists, which rocket you up into the air before slamming down to create a shockwave around you . Instead, you\u2019re more likely to lose because they\u2019re better at building than you are. The fine art of creating structures in combat is as definitively Fortnite as it is divisive, with detractors often complaining that shooting at an opponent prompts them to explode into an instant Eiffel Tower as they turtle up and erect a sniper\u2019s nest to shoot back from. It\u2019s absolutely absurd, but I like that building adds a literal depth to combat that takes Fortnite\u2019s already engaging, tense shooting mechanics and knocks the skill ceiling up a few notches as you learn to juggle the usual dance of aiming, dodging, and reloading with quickly laying down cover and managing your limited resources. This battle royale can still be enjoyed without mastering building. \u201c Epic has made it pretty easy to wrap your mind around the building controls, with quick shortcuts on both keyboard and controllers that make it simple to build a ramp to help climb a hill or set up a wall to defend yourself while you reload. It\u2019s not mandatory, though: As an admittedly weak builder, I can confidently say that I\u2019ve managed to eke out wins without much reliance on ensconcing myself in wood, stone, and metal, so it\u2019s not like this battle royale can\u2019t be enjoyed without mastering that skill, either. You can learn to take advantage of high fire-rate weapons like SMGs or the drum gun to quickly dismantle an opponent\u2019s creation before sniping them through the holes you made, or just rush them down with a shotgun and take them out where they thought they were safe. The main difference when you join a No Build match, which trades the ability to build for extra shields, is the flow and pace of combat. In the default mode, shootouts between equally matched players often last longer as both parties scramble to out-build, out-heal, and out-shoot each other in climactic moments that always push me to the edge of my seat before ending in either a frustrated groan or a sigh of relief. In No Build, combat is much tighter and leaves less room for missed shots as there are fewer places to hide. Since building takes extra cover out of the equation, these fights are also more often locked to the close quarters areas already on the map, and reward those who rush down their opponents rather than trying to snipe them from far away.

Continue playing See results In either mode, plenty of chokepoints and events pop up randomly to force confrontations or provide an extra advantage for those willing to seize it. Maybe the train\u2019s passing by where you landed \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky, you can snag a ton of goodies from its chest before someone else does. From there you might head toward some NPCs that you can see in the distance, who will open fire at you with the kind of flailing aim that would make a Stormtrooper look like a deadeye. After clearing their camp, you could be rewarded with an early forecast of where the safe zone at the center of Fortnite\u2019s deadly storm will head next, which is the kind of intel that can give you the jump on the other remaining players and be waiting when they rush to what they think is safety. Other optional events, such as NPC bosses with substantially better aim, pepper the map and offer useful rewards and nominal challenge, but chasing those also makes your location known: echoing gunfire and the enemy\u2019s health bar popping up on nearby players\u2019 screens exposes you for others to swoop in and capitalize on your being distracted. Meanwhile, friendly NPCs offer something completely different: You can buy worthwhile items like guns, healing items, hints, and sometimes even disguises that are reminiscent of the popular Gary\u2019s Mod game Prop Hunt which you can activate and use to camp out as a chair, barrel, or other piece of furniture you might find scattered around the island. You can also hire certain NPCs to help you out in a fight, which can make a difference in team-based modes where a shootout is more chaotic than just two people unloading their weapons at each other. All these options means there\u2019s always something interesting to do beyond simply looting and shooting. Moving around the map feels incredible, too. You can sprint, crouch while sprinting to go right into a slide (ripped straight out of Apex Legends), jump farther than normal, and even mantle while running. This may not sound like a lot compared to the aforementioned Titanfall spinoff\u2019s acrobatic movement, but Fortnite\u2019s current movement options are just enough to keep combat dynamic and challenging. You aren\u2019t so mobile that fights become frustrating, but there are still cool opportunities for some daring escapes after a showdown gone awry. There\u2019s just a dizzying amount of things going on in every match. \u201c And when running around on foot just doesn\u2019t cut it, there are plenty of cars and motorbikes scattered around the island like ride-sharing scooters for you to find. Each produces a brain-ticklingly satisfying purr as you zoom around and rock out to in-game radio stations with a diverse library of licensed tracks from the likes of Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, AC/DC, BLACKPINK, and more. Even if you\u2019re not necessarily going anywhere specific, it\u2019s hard to resist the thrill of jumping a car off a high bluff to get some air time backed by an energetic track, which last season not only enabled but encouraged thanks to its beefier and more customizable vehicles that would make George Miller Swoon. There\u2019s just a dizzying amount of things going on in every match, and because of that Fortnite accommodates so many different playstyles. Whether you\u2019re vying for the top spot, jumping a sports car off a ramp with your friends in a parking lot, or checking off story missions, it rewards your time with XP for doing just about everything. Sure, some activities offer more points than others \u2013 being the last person or team standing at the end of a match will always be the most important objective \u2013 but Epic goes out of its way to let you have a blast even if you don\u2019t place in the top 50. Experience points help fill out levels in the battle pass, which has both a free and paid tier and unlocks various cosmetics like skins for your character, weapons, pickaxe, and glider, as well as provides some in-game currency, called V-Bucks. That battle pass and its rewards have all but set the standard for how free-to-play games turn a profit, and while it\u2019s fun to unlock outfits that let me dress up like Kratos from God of War or Indiana Jones, I don\u2019t like how commonplace the almost compulsive nature this monetization strategy encourages has become. Microtransaction Reaction Microtransactions make the multiplayer world go round, and the free-to-play Fortnite is no different. Its monetization strategy is relatively inoffensive compared to other battle pass-driven games when you look at it in a vacuum, as it can be actually completed without any real-money buy-in, but it takes advantage of its notably young audience with a store set up in a way that still feels pretty uncomfortable. Fortnite\u2019s shop is explicitly designed to encourage impulsive buying thanks to its false scarcity. The skins and other cosmetics you have the option to purchase arbitrarily rotate, limiting their availability if you aren\u2019t always checking in \u2013 some popular options do show up in the shop more frequently, but with months between each seemingly random pop-up, it\u2019s an obnoxious system if you are just looking to buy one item you are interested in. Most individual skins will run you anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 V-Bucks (roughly USD $10-20), but character packs that come with emotes, backpacks called Back Bling, a skin, a harvesting pickaxe or other similar tool, and a glider can set you back much more, with most multi-skin packs costing at least 3,000 V-Bucks. Let\u2019s say you want to earn The Battle Pass itself without buying into Fortnite. At 950 V-Bucks, it\u2019s easily the best low-cost option to beef up your skin library, but with each season\u2019s free Battle Pass tier typically netting you 300 V-Bucks, you\u2019ll need to reach level 100 in at least 3 separate seasons and earn at least one V-Bucks unlock in a fourth. With each season lasting around ten weeks a pop, it would take you the better part of a year \u2013 about ten months \u2013 before you could unlock a Battle Pass for free. At that point, Epic\u2019s earned your $10 whether you like it or not. I did this grind over the course of about three or four years, hopping back in when friends wanted to play or a specific event seemed cool and collecting a few V-Bucks here and there. It\u2019s not super difficult to reach a high level on the Battle Pass since each week offers new quests with most being fairly doable within a handful of games, but it\u2019s still demanding as it asks you to come back for a couple of hours back week after week. And much like the Item Shop\u2019s false scarcity, most Battle Pass unlocks will never be available for purchase after the season is over. Thankfully, Fortnite doesn\u2019t lock anything that impacts the actual gameplay of a match behind premium purchases, and even allows you to earn enough V-Bucks to purchase optional skins through grinding alone. With years of big crossovers under its belt, the store has become a modern gallery of sorts. Painstakingly created emotes that replicate moments from rich and influential works like Alien, Metal Gear Solid, Marvel, and Star Wars are immortalized next to silly bits of internet culture ranging from the Orange Justice dance to the Stonks meme. Fortnite is the only place where you can see Darth Vader throw up a Wu-Tang W and rock out to C.R.E.A.M., or taunt other players with John Cena\u2019s iconic \u201cYou Can\u2019t See Me\u201d gesture as Goku. It\u2019s by no means the museum-quality homage to its source material the way the Super Smash Bros. series is to Mario, Zelda, or Donkey Kong, but it\u2019s an impressively curated collection of culture all the same. The Indiana Jones content from Chapter 3, Season 3 in the Summer of 2022 is a great example of how Fortnite often makes its crossovers feel like more than just a cosmetic cash grab. Its special limited-time mission asked you to explore the ruins of an ancient temple and find four runes, then organize the same symbols to open a door to a long corridor with a ton of loot at the end and a golden figure on a pedestal\u2026 but pilfering the idol will have exactly the result you expect. It\u2019s not just for show either: You could die from attempting that heist. It\u2019s impressive that such an iconic movie moment can be so seamlessly integrated into a completely unrelated game without missing a beat. Not every crossover gets a location on the map or special mission like this, but most will at least see some kind of cool inclusion like an emote and a skin or two that lovingly capture a character\u2019s image and presence within Fortnite\u2019s cohesive, cartoony style. For example, last season added Fallout\u2019s iconic Brotherhood of Steel T-60 Power Armor to the mix, which worked perfectly in its Mad Max-like apocalyptic wasteland. Somehow the T-60, Darth Vader, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Jill Valentine all look right at home next to one another, as if they were action figures on a shelf. It\u2019s a showcase of Unreal Engine 5\u2019s high-fidelity lighting effects. \u201c With Unreal Engine 5 powering everything, it\u2019s no surprise that they look as good as they do: waving fabrics, shiny metals, and a bold cel-shading style adorn these skins with a punch that hits the sweet spot between cartoonish and hyper-detailed. Even on the less powerful Nintendo Switch, Fortnite runs surprisingly well with a mostly steady framerate and consistent look \u2013 though that comes at the price of a really low draw distance, making anything but a small spec of movement hard to sus out from even moderately far away. Of course, on other consoles and PCs, it runs like a dream. It\u2019s also a graphical showcase with Unreal Engine 5\u2019s high-fidelity lighting effects on full display as the time of day changes, bathing its levels in harsh sunlight, golden evening rays, and glowing street lights. Most of the skins you unlock in battle royale transfer over into the other games found within Fortnite\u2019s main menu, each of which is chock-full of its own stuff to do. Lego Fortnite , for example, is a full-scale Minecraft-style co-op survival game with its own story and quests to explore and complete, while Fortnite Festival harkens back to the days of Rock Band. Even if I wasn\u2019t as interested in playing them, it\u2019s cool that the shared battle pass and cosmetics make your efforts in one impactful to the others. There\u2019s also a staggering amount of stuff that other players have made within Fortnite, and opening up the infinite tunnel of user-generated content reveals even more fun to be found. Like any game with creative tools that allow you to share your work, it\u2019s a literal mixed bag here with Epic Games\u2019 curation efforts doing some heavy lifting to help the cream rise to the top. One of my favorite user-generated game modes serves as a firing range of sorts that lets you try out any version of each weapon available in Battle Royale with unlimited ammo. But there\u2019s tons of other stuff, with whole worlds inspired by games like Phasmophobia that are so popular they have their own followings on Twitch. Charlie's Favorite Multiplayer Shooters I've been playing multiplayer shooters for about as long as I've been playing video games. From Halo and Black Ops II to Kid Icarus: Uprising and Splatoon, I've sunk a ton of time into the genre. Here are some of my favorites! See All Fortnite Epic Games Call of Duty: Black Ops II Treyarch Titanfall 2 Respawn Splatoon 3 Nintendo EPD Halo: The Master Chief Collection 343 Industries Kid Icarus Uprising Sora Ltd.. Halo Infinite 343 Industries Somehow, nearly all of these disparate ideas work together seamlessly, with only a few exceptions for what you can bring where depending on what mode you\u2019re playing \u2013 for example, you can only wear the Xenomorph skin in game modes with a \u201cT for Teen\u201d ESRB rating or higher \u2013 but most carry over, which makes even the fun diversions from the battle royale grind feel worth your time. That said, Fortnite\u2019s wide range of universes don\u2019t always collide gracefully. Watching characters who would never wield a gun \u2013 let alone kill someone \u2013 do both of those things in Fortnite is equally silly and a bit gross, because it often completely betrays the defining characteristics of their source material. No matter how funny it is to see Batman unload a clip into his foe before hitting The Griddy, it just doesn\u2019t feel right. By cementing itself as the place for titans of various mediums and industries to cross over, Fortnite has transformed into more than just a game, whether we like it or not. It\u2019s become the modern water cooler, as both a shared social space and the kind of rare cultural monolith that helps create connections thanks to its seamless crossplay and built-in voice chat \u2013 which is so well-supported it\u2019s even one of the very few games that supports native voice chat on the Nintendo Switch. Playing on Xbox, I can easily squad up with my roommate on his Switch in the same room and my buddy playing on his PC across the country without a hitch, which is truly impressive given how much trouble some other games can have with that sort of setup."

There\u2019s never the openness found in the large-by-comparison Mario Odyssey levels, but enough nooks and crannies to get stuck into nonetheless. There are even whole extra levels to find within levels, with warp points hidden like buried treasure that jet you off to new locations in the \"Lost Galaxy\". I'm a big fan of this Russian doll structure and the way it introduces new lands. It ensures a constant supply of surprises throughout Astro Bot\u2019s roughly nine-hour duration. Some of those biggest unexpected treats are the new powers that Astro gets along his journey. The basic movement of our little robot pal is great, with his jump, double jump, and hover hitting that sweet spot between floaty and finely tuned. But it\u2019s the temporary abilities that come with each level that make things truly exciting. The Twin Frog gloves are a particular favourite, with their sticky tongues flinging out to provide a grapple swing option. They're also spring-loaded, meaning any incoming projectiles can be sent back from whence they came, exploding in an enemy\u2019s face. I also very much enjoyed the mouse mechanic, which reduces you down to a super small size, effectively turning on a \"Toy Story\" mode that lets you clamber up oversized shelves and leaves in search of secrets. Even powers from previous Astro adventures are reinvented to great effect. For example, the Monkey Climber is an evolution of Playroom's climbing ability, but the assistance of a small robotic ape with huge hands this time means rocks can be hurled and ground pounded to great delight. Laurels are never rested on either, with new ideas and gadgets introduced right up to the final encore. Although some mechanics are reused a little more than I\u2019d like, when such powers are recycled in later levels they're thankfully recontextualised and given slightly new uses. The aforementioned Twin Frog gloves, for instance, are reintroduced in a cave-like level, where their grapple-swinging ability comes into its own even further, encouraging you to pull worm-like enemies out of the ground from afar. Outside of bosses and minibosses, there initially doesn't appear to be a great range in enemy types. Sure, some are coated in different colours of paint or dressed to fit in with their surroundings, but they are all vanquished via the same few fundamental jump and hit combos. Later on, though, the design book opens up and introduces some of my favourite foes. These include an anthropomorphic playing card that flings a hand of clubs and spades your way, which you can then jump on to make your way towards the enemy to deal a killing blow of your own. It\u2019s light touches of irony and slapstick humour that keep Astro\u2019s playful tone going throughout. \u201c Much friendlier faces can be found frequently, though. Over 150 of them in fact, as characters from PlayStation's vast library of games have made their way into Astro's world in the form of other bots . There are the ones you'd expect like Lombaxes, tomb raiders, and a certain rapping dog but, delightfully, some are plucked from the more obscure end of the scale. Mister Mosquito, here\u2019s looking at you kid. You\u2019ll never know where you\u2019ll find them either. For example, you\u2019ll rescue everyone's favourite tactical espionage action hero from the unfamiliar surroundings of Creamy Canyon \u2013 a dessert-based land dressed in sprinkles that\u2019s a far cry from the steel and snow of Shadow Moses. It\u2019s light touches of irony and slapstick humour like this that keep Astro\u2019s playful tone going throughout. It really is just a delight from start to finish in this regard.

I won't spoil who gets the star treatment here, aside from one \u2013 the previously revealed Kratos. His introduction sees you wield his ice-infused Leviathan axe and take on the role of the exiled Spartan himself in a thrilling change of pace, the frosty blade boomeranging around the level. It's here where Astro Bot becomes truly magical, elegantly blending nostalgia with new ideas. Such moments essentially let you play these iconic games in miniature, lending Astro their powers and letting him loose in a level entirely built around familiar stories and settings, soundtracked by remixes of heroic themes. They're charming and often the real highlight of the experience. I just wish there were one or two more of them, but perhaps I\u2019m being greedy. It\u2019s clear from the very first frame of Astro Bot just how much love and reverence Team Asobi has for the history of Sony\u2019s consoles and their library of games. You choose a new save file by selecting one of three original PlayStation memory cards and are then thrust into a scene taking place on your PS5-shaped mothership. In terms of story, well\u2026 it's light. That mothership crash lands on a desert planet after an evil alien attack, and Astro must now travel the galaxy searching for its missing parts and crewmates. It\u2019s clear from the very first frame of Astro Bot just how much love and reverence Team Asobi has for the history of Sony\u2019s consoles. \u201c But a deep story isn\u2019t what you're here for, is it? Free from the now-standard PlayStation Studios themes of threatening apocalypses, familial woe, and coming-of-age pains, Astro Bot is all about following a cheery little metal bloke around on his adventures. That's not to say it won't spark an emotional response, though \u2013 not through any great feat of nuanced writing, but when bumping into ghosts of PlayStation past and greeting them like an old school friend you haven't seen in a decade. The crash site hub world has its own areas to explore and is packed full of quirks, such as eventually letting you customise your ship and outfit. The gacha machine mechanic makes a particularly enjoyable return, providing a satisfying way to spend the thousands of coins you'll collect. The way it builds out the hub with memorabilia and miniature dioramas for the PlayStation-themed bots to adorably call home again proves a fun, tangible way of visualising your progress through the adventure, rather than simply watching numbers tick up on a screen. It's not brand-new for the series at this point, but still hits all the right spots. Who is PlayStation's best platforming mascot? Astro Bot Crash Bandicoot Jak & Daxter Ratchet & Clank Knack Other (let us know in the comments!) Answer See Results I arrived at the end credits after nine hours but had only collected 206 out of a possible 301 bots on my journey. There\u2019s plenty to do after the main levels are done, including finding the remainder of the crew, building out the rest of the hub base, and unearthing new secrets among the stars. There\u2019s so much, in fact, that it took me another nine hours (so, 18 in total) to 100% Astro Bot and acquire the platinum trophy that comes with it. While I'd never say any of its main worlds ever approach being truly \"difficult\" in the pursuit of that 100% completion goal, some enemies or obstacles did take a few tries. Thankfully, checkpoints are often generously and frequently located, meaning you're only ever moments away from the spot of your previous demise. An extra level of difficulty can be found in the semi-hidden trial-like stages found by exploring among the overworld's stars, though. These short sprints are littered with fast-moving objects, numerous enemies, and precise gaps to hop across that are designed to trip you up. Throw a complete lack of checkpoints into the mix as well, and these are easily some of the toughest tasks in Astro Bot, with a final level that\u2019s a real tough nut to crack. It\u2019s a non-stop gauntlet of quickfire threats that made me piece together everything I had learned up until that point in a frantic, but still fun test."

        "Content": "Regularly playing Destiny for the past decade, through all its unforgettable highs and painful lows, has been a tremendous leap of faith for me and my fellow Guardians. This uneven saga hasn\u2019t always felt like it was leading somewhere worth following, but with Destiny 2: The Final Shape, our faith has been rewarded at last. The campaign ends a tale that started way back in 2014 on a high note, the new Prismatic subclasses are exactly the badass shock to the system its sandbox needed, the fresh set of weapons are a literal blast to mess around with, and the fearsome Dread enemy faction add welcome variety and difficulty to the battlefield. Even the raid, which I only managed to best after days of getting my teeth kicked in, is one of the most impressive and devilishly challenging activities developer Bungie has ever produced. Destiny 2 might still be quite messy, with its hodgepodge of long running issues and the Milky Way\u2019s most confusing RPG systems and menus, but it\u2019s also more fun to play than it's ever been right now, and that\u2019s just about enough to bring a tear to this veteran player\u2019s eye. Destiny 2: The Final Shape Launch Screenshots 177 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask If you\u2019re arriving extremely late to the space opera party, The Final Shape is the latest and greatest expansion in Bungie\u2019s ongoing, magically-infused multiplayer FPS. As an immortal and homicidally-inclined Guardian, I\u2019ve had the privilege of defending humanity against all manner of alien threats over the years, from evil sorcerer insects to an extremely boring robot army, all while looting cool weapons and armor, unlocking sweet space magic abilities, leveling up, and juggling so many currencies, menus, and ill-explained RPG systems that your head is liable to explode Arc of the Covenant-style if you don\u2019t have a friend to initially walk you through it all. After seven years of expansions, patches, and seasonal updates, Destiny 2 has grown into one of the best and twelve of the worst games you\u2019ll ever play, all wrapped into a live-service package unlike anything else out there. It\u2019s great; I hate it. This campaign finally sold me on the existential horror of The Witness. \u201c The Final Shape has the unenviable task of concluding the main story of good vs. evil that\u2019s haphazardly played out since the first Destiny. Although that story has mostly been a veritable jambalaya of overused tropes, sci-fi gobbledygook, and lore so convoluted one player had to make a ten hour YouTube video to explain it , it occasionally brings the heat with some genuinely compelling characters and meaningful moments, like those found in 2022\u2019s The Witch Queen . Thankfully, The Final Shape counts itself among those rare instances of solid storytelling, finally focusing on the big bad that\u2019s been alluded to from the very beginning for a showdown with the fate of the universe on the line.  Will you still play Destiny after The Final Shape? You must be logged in to vote Yes! More Destiny is a good thing! It depends on what comes after it... Nope. Ten years of Destiny is quite enough for me! Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results That archenemy comes in the form of The Witness, and although I wasn\u2019t impressed with the character\u2019s initial reveal or the setup that\u2019s taken place over the past two years leading up to this finale, The Final Shape\u2019s campaign, packed with hard-hitting cutscenes that explain a whole lot, finally sold me on this existential horror. I won\u2019t go into details to spare you any spoilers, but The Witness ended up being a much more interesting villain than I\u2019d anticipated, the threat humanity is facing finally feels real instead of like some distant shadow we have an appointment with, and I\u2019m thrilled we\u2019re finally getting some actual answers to the questions we\u2019ve had all these years. That said, there are still plenty of points in The Final Shape where Destiny\u2019s usually sloppier storytelling continues in that tradition, like when the middle act pivots to some drama with the stoic and stalwart Commander Zavala, who suddenly (and with only the scarcest whiff of justification) becomes an emotional loose cannon to add a bit of unearned tension into the mix. There\u2019s also some side stories with obscure characters returning from seasons you might not have played or lore entries you probably didn\u2019t read, which mostly pulls focus away from the conflict at hand without adding a whole lot \u2013 the kind of par-for-the-course wonky Destiny storytelling that\u2019s irked me since 2014. The Final Shape actually manages to deliver a satisfying end to this epic story. \u201c But The Final Shape manages to succeed in its most crucial mission: actually delivering a satisfying ending to this epic tale, and I\u2019m genuinely shocked by how well they managed to pull that off. There\u2019s still plenty of loose threads and unanswered questions that will presumably be addressed in whatever comes next for the series, but we finally got a proper conclusion to the main plot we\u2019ve been following all these years, with some really epic fights and emotional moments wrapping things up much more neatly than I thought possible. The levels you\u2019ll play and new areas you\u2019ll explore while enjoying the campaign are also some of my favorites yet. Delving into the body of a God, you\u2019ll explore The Pale Heart of the Traveler, a bizarre reality where one\u2019s memories, desires, and fears manifest themselves in the physical world. What starts as an idyllic but peculiar world begins to shift into a horrific landscape, as the twisted wishes of The Witness corrupt it, with a bunch of gross hands and faces filling up the environment. That gives it an uncomfortable and surreal quality that\u2019s a massive departure from the mostly grounded areas our Guardians have visited so far. It\u2019s also fantastic that we finally got a map that isn\u2019t just a loop with a few small areas to explore, instead favoring a fairly linear layout that feels like traveling from the Shire to Mount Doom on an epic quest to put the world right. I\u2019m still exploring its nooks and crannies, shooting and looting everything I can find, but it\u2019s already easily my favorite destination to date. Similarly, its missions follow in the fantastic footsteps of The Witch Queen by adding light raid mechanics and challenging combat encounters, which provide more than the mindless shooting hallways that Destiny sometimes finds itself reduced to. In one level, you\u2019ll hop between two realities to solve a puzzle in order to kill a massive boss, and in another you\u2019ll battle to the top of some icy peaks, taking advantage of gale winds to propel yourself across massive gaps. Each level does a great job of teaching you a new mechanic here and there, slowly adding to the complexity of gunplay and puzzle solving, until somehow you\u2019re juggling half a dozen things at once by the final battle, taking out an army of foes in one of the most badass showdowns so far. One of the things that makes these missions so enjoyable is the first new enemy faction Destiny has gotten in six years, called the Dread. Even the two other enemy factions added in previous Destiny expansions were mostly remixes of existing enemies, so one could argue that the Dread are the first fully original faction so far, and what a difference that makes. The Grim, batlike creatures that fly around pelting you with blaster fire and screeching at you to slow your movement are overwhelming in large groups, while the Husk are melee bruisers who rush in with deadly blades and send explosive creatures flying at you if you don\u2019t kill them in a specific way. Most of these additions are completely awesome, injecting some desperately needed variety into a sandbox that has stagnated over time. That said, there are a few that are less inspired: Attendants and Weavers, for example, appear almost as reskinned enemies from an existing race and pelt you with irritating abilities, including one that makes you move extremely slowly for way too long, which resulted in more than a few deaths that felt a bit cheap. Still, these are minor qualms I have with a faction that\u2019s been a ton of fun to fight. The Dread are awesome, injecting much needed variety into the sandbox. \u201c As always, the latest Destiny expansion comes with a whole arsenal of unique toys to loot and bring to bear upon your foes, and The Final Shape has some really nice additions. The Call, a small sidearm that shoots mini rockets, is absolutely phenomenal to goof around with, while Lost Signal is a grenade launcher that shoots a smattering of explosives that do damage over time. My personal favorite new item is an exotic called Hazardous Propulsion that launches a flurry of missiles from your back whenever you use your class ability, which has gotten me out of so many tight spots lately \u2013 I\u2019m completely obsessed. Destiny has always been renowned for its gunplay, even when other aspects of the shooter have come up short, so none of this is particularly surprising. But even for a game that\u2019s known for its great weapons and armor, The Final Shape is a standout in what it offers. They really cooked on this one, folks! The Final Shape also adds to Destiny\u2019s space magic repertoire with a new subclass called Prismatic, which allows you to mix and match certain Light and Darkness abilities found in other subclasses to create interesting combinations. It then adds some new abilities of its own on top of that, from grenades that combine different damage types and status effects in order to do things like suspend enemies in the air and electrocute everything in the vicinity, to new super abilities that might let you throw giant exploding axes onto the battlefield, then pick them up to wreak havoc on the enemy. Being able to wield a mix of elements and abilities that were previously locked behind their own specific classes is a major game changer, and takes buildcrafting to the next level in terms of customization and playing around with different possibilities. After many hours of trying out the subclasses and unlocking all the different customization options, I still feel like I\u2019m only just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible with this super unique and deeply configurable new toolset \u2013 that goes a long way in a live-service shooter that can often feel stagnant after so many years of lobbing the same sparkly magic abilities.

This raid is the most difficult challenge Bungie has ever created, and after sweating it out for over 25 hours in recent days to get my first clear, it easily tops my all-time raid list. The mechanics are complex and require intense precision and communication from those on your team, the constantly spawning enemies push your skills to the limit at nearly every moment, and for the first time in Destiny history, there\u2019s no room for a few players to take a backseat and get carried by their friends \u2013 if you don\u2019t have all six members of your fireteam playing their role to perfection, you\u2019ll find yourself repeatedly and utterly crushed by the enemy. As someone who really enjoys a challenge, mastering each encounter of this raid was a peak Destiny experience for me. Finally, there\u2019s the episodic content called \u201cEchoes\u201d that recently started rolling out, alongside more optional activities like Exotic Quests, which aim to keep you engaged well beyond the expansion\u2019s central campaign. The stuff that\u2019s currently available as part of the first post-Final Shape episode mostly follows the same tired model of running matchmade activities every week to unlock small bits of story and new loot, but the Exotic Quests and other surprises that have been added have really impressed me. I doubt any of this piecemeal content will keep me invested in the same way The Final Shape\u2019s campaign and raid have, but it\u2019s definitely a step up from the previous seasonal model that opted for more frequent, less meaty updates.

        "Content": "It feels like a thousand years have passed since Princess Peach first summoned Mario to the seedy city of Rogueport to hunt for the legendary treasure that sleeps beneath the town. In reality, it\u2019s only been 20 since Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door graced the GameCube, but it seems longer because the Paper Mario series has abandoned its traditional turn-based RPG battles ever since. The Thousand-Year Door rapidly faded into legend, kept alive by the spoken word of longtime Nintendo fans who clung onto hope that it would one day open again. Finally, that patience has paid off, as the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive version of this classic adventure. It unquestionably justifies why the original is so treasured, pairing a faithful recreation of one of Mario\u2019s most iconic quests with a set of welcome additions and modern improvements that keep it feeling fresh off the printing press even two decades later. Just as Princess Peach tells Mario he MUST come to Rogueport , I\u2019m telling you that you MUST play The Thousand-Year Door. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake Screenshots 27 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask From its opening moments to the end credits, it\u2019s still impressive how distinct this RPG feels from any other game in the wide Mario universe. The surprisingly gritty world of Rogueport and its surrounding towns, a lovable cast of offbeat partners Mario recruits along the way, and an Indiana Jones-style race between Mario and the scheming X-Nauts to unlock the secret behind the sleeping door give this journey an unforgettable identity that has passed the test of time with flying colors. It helps that the Switch remake is absolutely gorgeous, with lovingly redone character models and dazzling environments that fully commit to the original\u2019s papery, storybook aesthetic. It\u2019s always a joy to look at, and the lighting in darker environments like Hooktail\u2019s Castle, Boggly Woods, and Twilight Town is stunning. It maintains 30 frames per second very consistently, as I only noticed slight framerate dips in moments where the screen is flooded with hundreds of characters at once, but that doesn\u2019t happen often so it never really bothered me. The revamped soundtrack is similarly amazing, with outstanding updated versions of the original tunes and new battle theme arrangements specific to each location. The sharp, laugh-out-loud script is consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004. \u201c The exciting premise and artistic world are backed up by a sharp, laugh-out-loud script that\u2019s consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004. The Thousand-Year Door wastes no time setting its comedic, irreverent tone: Just minutes after Mario sets foot in Rogueport, he\u2019s witness to the town\u2019s high crime rate as members of the Pianta Syndicate get in a brawl with their rival Robbo Thieves in the background. Almost every character does or says something hilarious that also serves the excellent worldbuilding, like the evil, cackling spirits who are convinced they\u2019re cursing Mario for all eternity, when they\u2019re actually blessing him with a useful upgrade. Side characters like those from the Pianta Syndicate and Robbo Thieves constantly intertwine with Mario\u2019s journey, and some folks even email life updates to his Game Boy Advance SP-like phone with adorable photos of themselves attached. How thoughtful! Small interludes also stand out, like ones where you play as Princess Peach while she\u2019s held in captivity by the X-Nauts or as Bowser as he searches for the mythical treasure with his moronic band of minions. Some story elements from Princess Peach\u2019s segments haven\u2019t aged super gracefully \u2013 it plays up the fact that she has to take off her dress not one, not two, but three separate times across less than 30 total minutes of Peach gameplay \u2013 but it\u2019s still fun to see how she assists Mario from afar. The Bowser sections offer a glimpse of how the King of the Koopas comically mismanages his dysfunctional army when he\u2019s not getting tossed around by Mario. What's your favorite Paper Mario game? Paper Mario (N64) The Thousand-Year Door (GameCube) Super Paper Mario (Wii) Sticker Star (3DS) Color Splash (Wii U) The Origami King (Switch) Answer See Results Another clear highlight is bumping into Luigi throughout Rogueport, where he updates Mario on his parallel misadventures in the Waffle Kingdom. Mario can\u2019t even stay awake to hear the whole story (poor Luigi!), but I love soaking up every word of it. This remake enhances the endearing dialogue even further, as developer Intelligent Systems replaced the generic typewriter text sound from the original with an amusing Animal Crossing-like babbling noise unique to each character type. It\u2019s an impressive touch that shows a willingness to go above and beyond to polish this beloved tale. Mario\u2019s quest to collect the Crystal Stars before the X-Nauts do is the backdrop for each of the eight chapters, but some of the most unforgettable moments come from within the smaller stories that pop up. For example, one Crystal Star is the crown jewel of a wrestling championship belt, kicking off an incredible sequence where Mario \u2013 dubbed by his promoter as \u201cThe Great Gonzales\u201d \u2013 climbs the ranks in the Glitz Pit\u2019s cutthroat pro wrestling world. Every chapter has its own flavor like this, and it\u2019s always delightful to see where Mario and friends will end up next. It\u2019s Dangerous to Go Alone\u2026 Take Partners! Speaking of friends, Mario\u2019s party of seven partners is one of The Thousand-Year Door\u2019s greatest strengths. Each character you recruit has a well-defined design and personality: Koops is an insecure, shy Koopa who musters up the courage to travel with Mario to avenge his father, while Goombella is a smart, sassy student at the University of Goom who\u2019s interested in archaeology. Every chapter provides some backstory for the new companion it introduces that\u2019s generally very sweet and oftentimes strikingly mature and emotionally resonant, which highlights how the series hasn\u2019t managed to match their quality since. When exploring, each partner helps out in a unique way: You can kick Koops\u2019 shell to hit far-off switches, while Yoshi significantly increases your speed and can flutter across gaps. The remake\u2019s new Partner Ring lets you change characters on the fly in the overworld, making some late-game puzzles that require lots of partner switching much snappier. And, there\u2019s a robust new hint system you can access at any time where Goombella will tell you exactly what to do next. Some quests are a little bit obtuse at times, like when it\u2019s unclear who exactly you need to talk with to advance the story, so that was a nice fallback that ensured I never got stuck.

Paper Mario\u2019s trademark Action Commands are here, where you deal more and take less damage if you properly time the correct button presses. But The Thousand-Year Door takes it much further than basic jumping, hammering, and blocking, spicing up its battles with a great Badge-based upgrade system and electric live audience so I never got tired of fighting at any point during the 30-hour campaign. Collectable Badges \u2013 which are hidden throughout the world and on sale at Rogueport\u2019s Lovely Howz of Badges \u2013 let you customize Mario\u2019s abilities however you want as long as you have enough Badge Points to equip them. There are over 80 Badges to choose from: Some give Mario powerful new types of jump or hammer attacks, like the Quake Hammer, which attacks all non-flying enemies with one big smash. Other badges impact Mario\u2019s stats, like the P-Up, D-Down Badge that boosts attack power but sacrifices defense. I turned my Mario into a glass cannon, to the point where perfect Action Commands disposed of enemies in a flash, but any mistake led to him taking serious damage. As a Paper Mario pro, I loved turning up the heat with my Badge builds to create more of a high-risk, high-reward balance, and it\u2019s always fun to mix and match to try out different combinations if anything starts to feel stale. Pumping up the crowd is one of the coolest mechanics I\u2019ve ever seen in an RPG. \u201c It\u2019s the live audience, though, that truly pushes battles to the next level. Lots of Nintendo games are presented as stage plays (a tradition going back to Super Mario Bros. 3 and most recently seen in Princess Peach: Showtime!), but The Thousand-Year Door has my favorite implementation of this idea. When a fight begins, Mushroom Kingdom citizens frantically rush into an auditorium to watch it unfold on stage, cheering when Mario does well and leaving early when things go poorly (are they trying to beat traffic?). Hecklers threaten to pelt Mario with rocks and stage lights or fog machines might malfunction during the battle, requiring a timely block. Balancing fighting with appealing to the crowd is so dynamic, and it\u2019s even more entertaining when you pull off the Stylish Moves that add flourishes to attacks and make the crowd go wild. Mario can backflip after pulling off a Hammer attack, or Koops can breakdance after rushing through a line of enemies in his shell. Pumping up the crowd through well-executed Action Commands and Stylish Moves fills up Mario\u2019s special attack meter, and it\u2019s one of the coolest mechanics I\u2019ve ever seen in an RPG. The fights aren\u2019t especially difficult \u2013 with the exception of some late-game bosses and optional challenges like the returning Pit of 100 Trials \u2013 but keeping track of all the mechanics at play during battle meant I never fell into a repetitive rut where I stopped having to think. If you love punishment, the Double Pain Badge doubles the amount of damage Mario takes, but besides that there aren\u2019t traditional difficulty options to be found here. On the flipside, if you\u2019re a Paper Mario rookie and want to improve your skills, the new Battle Master Toad hanging out in most towns lets you practice your Action Command timing whenever you like with no penalty for messing up. What we said about the original Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door With Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga finished and stashed away, I was ready for another opportunity to venture into Mario's RPG realm. While there's plenty of room for better presentation, this game is an absolute blast to play. Get past the slow-moving first chapter and some clunky NPC path finding routines in chapter 2 and you'll be hooked. The story is funny, the gameplay varied, and the world so charming, you'll want to explore every last corner of it. Add to that plenty of playable characters and sidekicks, some great cameos, a memorable score loaded with classic melodies, and a quest that runs a good 30 hours long, and you've got another winning offshoot in the mighty Mario franchise. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door improves on its predecessor in every way and takes the cake as the best Mario RPG yet. Highly recommended. - Peer Schneider, October 11, 2004 Score: 9.1 Read the original Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door review . There and Back Again The Thousand-Year Door\u2019s one major flaw I wish this remake had done more to fix is the main quest\u2019s overreliance on backtracking. Most areas have two major points of interest separated by several linear pathways, and the campaign frequently forces you to travel back and forth between them multiple times over the course of a chapter. Adventures on the pirate island of Keelhaul Key and in the spooky Twilight Town are especially bad about this. These chapters make Mario travel all the way to the edge of an area, realize he doesn\u2019t have the means to progress further, walk back to the town he started in to get something, then return, and so on. It\u2019s about as much fun as realizing you forgot your wallet as you pull into the movie theater parking lot. The new Partner Ring means your trusty Yoshi steed is more accessible than ever, so at least it\u2019s quicker to run back and forth than it was on GameCube, but that\u2019s a half measure when it comes to fixing the level design, which is noticeably outdated in a remake that otherwise feels pretty modern. I do wish more had been done to fix the overreliance on backtracking. \u201c To its credit, Intelligent Systems made several changes to at least somewhat address the backtracking problem without fundamentally changing the original\u2019s design. In Keelhaul Key, a helpful new spring shortcut means you only have to do an annoying section of precise Yoshi platforming once, rather than every time the chapter asks you to go back and forth across its screens. So they removed the painful part, but not the actual trek. It\u2019s not as if major changes were unthinkable, because The Thousand-Year Door has some big ones elsewhere, the best of which is its revamped Warp Pipe Room. This fast-travel hub opens up underneath Rogueport a few chapters in, and it\u2019s a total game changer for quests that make you revisit previous locations. In the original, the only way to get to the Glitz Pit was to ride the blimp all the way on the far side of Rogueport. Now, there\u2019s a pipe that zips you straight there, and it\u2019s conveniently labeled in a room filled with pipes that lead back to the central locations from every chapter. Similarly, longtime fans will remember that Chapter 7 contains a particularly ridiculous quest that requires revisiting every major town in the world, but with the help of the new-and-improved Warp Pipe Room I was done with this mission in less than 10 minutes. It wasn\u2019t a particularly stellar 10 minutes in terms of actual entertainment, but it was a lot less tedious than what I\u2019d been braced for. What's the Best Mario Game of All Time?

Continue playing See results Even if solutions like this feel like putting makeup on a blemish that we all can tell is still there,  I respect the decision to keep this remake extremely faithful, and the combat, story, music, and graphics are so much fun that I really don\u2019t mind the back-and-forth exploration too much. And thankfully, you don\u2019t see any tedium in the fantastic dungeons, which are packed with interesting puzzles, collectibles, and epic boss fights that shake up the usual battle conventions in interesting, cinematic ways. Mario also learns clever paper abilities throughout the campaign, like turning into a paper airplane or rolling up into a tube, and those open up new shortcuts and secrets in the Rogueport Sewers to give exploration an almost metroidvania-like feel at times. Outside of the main campaign, the entirely optional side quests are your pretty standard RPG fetch-quest fare. Sometimes they\u2019re good for a laugh, like a mouse who asks Mario to whack him with his hammer over and over again until he remembers something important, but from a reward standpoint they\u2019re largely skippable because they mostly give you items or coins that can easily be found elsewhere. I also dislike the side quest system: Mario can only accept one at a time from Rogueport\u2019s Trouble Center, and you must solve or abandon it before taking on a new task. If this remake is already trying to make things more convenient, why not let us take on multiple quests at once to cut down on the number of times completionists will have to walk back and pick up a new one? As it stands, they don\u2019t seem worth doing\u2026 with the exception of one extremely worthwhile reward I won\u2019t spoil here.

        "Content": "Tamashii: Chronicle of Ascend is a high concept board game . It\u2019s a cooperative cyberpunk adventure game bathed in neon. You awake from a coma finding your consciousness inhabiting a foreign body. Your memory is clouded and nothing is familiar. The nearby city is in shambles. Machines and faceless agents begin to stalk you. A chance meeting with an underground faction opens an entirely new world. Towering above it all is a tyrannical AI known as Ascend. It\u2019s exceedingly cool. The large box is swollen with content. There are hundreds of cards that make up enemies, scenarios, and abilities. Large vibrant player boards host tokens and chits of various colors. Dozens of tiles are randomized to construct the post-apocalyptic city. Large standees - or lovely miniatures if you spring for the add-on - depict various bodies the protagonists pilot. It\u2019s a very attractive product that works an extra shift to sell its mysterious setting. Tamashii: Chronicle of Ascend 1 See it at Amazon IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Its style is not simply veneer, either. Vibrating beneath the surface of this handsome exterior are two prominent systems that work together to deliver an electric experience. The first governs the city itself. Each scenario contains a map of the environment, a collection of district tiles that are often semi-randomized. They are arranged in an overall shape to form an interconnected board. Players will traverse the map by flipping over unexplored areas and interacting with various location abilities. This portion of the game walks between the extremes of a fully detailed environment and a thin abstract space devoid of personality. It broadly mimics the style of adventure board games such as Arkham Horror and Return to Dark Tower , with characters navigating a zoomed out macro-level map. It doesn\u2019t quite manage a rich portrayal of the city itself, instead leaning into a more distant and lean depiction that provides context for the second half of the game. The bulk of play is contained on each player\u2019s personal board. This mat resembles a HUD of sorts, and it contains several systems that interlock to form the digital arena. The focus here is on the launcher, a large central area of the player board that hosts colorful data tokens of various types. Each turn, players draw these tokens from a bag and repopulate their launcher. They spend actions to move these tokens around, shifting them into new slots in an attempt to form various patterns. When you complete a pattern, the tokens are spent and a benefit is triggered, such as hacking an enemy drone that is pursuing you, establishing a data uplink to fulfill a scenario objective, or gaining new intel and assets to prop up your character. This is ostensibly a puzzle, similar to Bejeweled and Candy Crush. It\u2019s a system I\u2019ve never seen imitated on the tabletop, and it\u2019s surprising how effective it is as an engaging mini-game that is core to the Tamashii experience. It might not feel like computer programming or hacking, exactly, but it can be surprisingly tense. Everything else is handled through modular extensions of the various components. Enemies are represented solely by cards. They attach to your player board and follow your character around, harassing them in the conflict phase where blows are traded. Experience is gained through defeating enemies and triggering certain patterns on the launcher. These are spent to upgrade certain attributes and acquire new permanent ability cards. Bodies for your character to inhabit are locked into the top of the player board, offering new combat options and traits (if combat is your thing, check out our roundup of the best war board games ). Everything is tied wonderfully together through the scenario architecture. Scenarios consist of small booklets with an accompanying deck of mission cards. You are given narrative background, initial setup conditions including unique rules, and a first stage objective. Often, this requires you head to specific points on the map. Sometimes you must perform special actions or complete patterns on your launcher to progress the story. Often you are required to make a decision which leads down a branching narrative path. This may be choosing one of two factions to aid, or deciding between rescuing civilians and selfishly preserving your own life. These decisions are meaningful and shape subsequent stages of the scenario, altering your goals and leading to a unique climax. The scenario variety is fortunately strong. Each is rated for length and difficulty, which lets you know what you're in for before starting. This isn\u2019t a perfect approach, however, as the overall challenge presented is somewhat shallow. In fact, I\u2019d prefer the difficulty to be ratcheted up across the board, as far too often the game simply doesn\u2019t throw up enough obstacles to inhibit progress. It also occasionally stretches on too long. The longer scenarios can cross the three hour mark, dragging during the mid-game, and not picking up again until the final act is triggered. Thankfully, this is uncommon and the length depicted on the title page of the scenario will at least clue you in on this possibility. Surprisingly bucking the recent trend of campaign board games , Tamashii does not feature linked scenario play. Each session is an isolated story and can be played with a rotating cast of players. However, the game introduces a unique roguelike-inspired system of unlocking content. Depending on the particular ending you trigger in a scenario, new content is added to the game for future plays. This may mean new body or enemy cards, or even new location tiles, are added to the mix. The box offers a functional, although unfortunately messy, organization system to segregate locked content from the rest of the components. This content unlocking is a really fantastic feature. I was always eager to get back to the table to try these new options. It feels modern, touching on some of the benefits of the campaign format found in narrative board games , but without the long term commitment of a dedicated group. While the writing in the scenarios isn't always superb, it works when woven into the fabric of the branching decision structure. This story layer sits atop the rest of the game forming the fibers that connect the various components to create an interactive and engrossing experience. Tamashii: Chronicle of Ascend is a juggernaut of powerful and flexible machinery that delivers captivating drama.

From the mechanical skills and knowledge needed to compete at the highest levels, to its iconic music and characters, to inside jokes spanning three decades and an ongoing story dating back just as far, each new entry has a heavy burden to bear. How do you honor that legacy without being chained down by it? That is the question Tekken 8 thoughtfully considers, and the answer it comes up with is a simple, yet profound one: you accept what\u2019s come before, but you don\u2019t let it stop you from moving forward. Whether it be a literal dash forward using the powerful new Heat system, impressive training tools, or the compelling story of a man trying to break generational shackles to create a brighter future, Tekken 8 is always honoring its past while striving to improve its present.

Movement, spacing, block punishing, and whiff punishing all remain as vital as ever, but two significant additions also twist those mechanics in exciting ways: recoverable health, and the Heat System. For the first time in Tekken history, other than the Tekken Tag Tournament games, recoverable health plays a major part in matches. Blocking big attacks and taking chip damage, absorbing them with a Power Crush, or being hit after getting knocked airborne will do partial gray damage. The only way to get this health back is by throwing out your own attacks, as you won\u2019t recover at all by just standing still and blocking \u2013 you have to go on the offensive to reclaim your life, and this made me adapt my mindset in a wonderful way. It\u2019s also a huge shift, as Tekken has always been a defensive game. It\u2019s not uncommon to watch high-level Tekken matches of the past and see two characters appear to almost glitch across the screen as they continuously cancel their sidesteps and dashes and block everything while looking for the smallest opening. A lot of that hasn\u2019t gone away in Tekken 8, but recoverable damage gave me the constant pressure to go on offense while I still had health that could be recovered, and never made me feel like I was out of the fight while being juggled across the stage. You have to go on the offensive to reclaim your life, and this made me adapt my mindset in a wonderful way. \u201c The new Heat system pairs with this new offensive mindset perfectly. There are myriad ways to enter Heat, whether it be through landing staple moves from a character\u2019s move list or simply pressing a button, and you start with a full bar of Heat every round, so there\u2019s no reason not to use it. Heat enhances your offense in every facet \u2013 you do increased chip damage while recovering more of your own health, you unlock new moves or properties for each character, and you can use the rest of your meter for a powerful combo extender or finisher. Do you press your advantage when you have your enemy on the ropes, or do you wait for an opportunity to recover health? Do you add a little bit of damage onto a combo now, or maintain stronger pressure after a knockdown later? Since you regain all of your Heat after every round , these are questions you get to answer every round , and Tekken 8 is much more dynamic for it. The 10 Best Fighting Games 11 Images That said, one aspect of these changes I could see eventually getting frustrating is how it gives even more offensive pressure to characters who thrive on it, like Hwoarang and the various members of the Mishima family. It\u2019s scary enough to try and keep blocking when it seems like it\u2019s been your opponent\u2019s turn to attack forever, so adding in chip damage and extra tools for characters with overwhelming offense is even more to deal with. But since these tools are universal, you always have a chance to turn the tide yourself, and Heat makes execution for a lot of moves easier, such as the Mishimas\u2019 electric attacks no longer requiring a single-frame input. Heat is both your most powerful offensive tool and a great equalizer. On top of Heat naturally smoothing out the beginner\u2019s on-ramp a bit, Tekken 8 also has some of the best training tools I\u2019ve ever seen in a fighting game. The new Arcade Quest mode is a great way to slowly ramp up the difficulty of CPU opponents, and the Training Mode is incredibly full featured, with combo challenges, save states (so you can drill specific situations like wall breaks easily), punishment training, moves you can pin to the screen while practicing them, and handy notes and icons that tell you the specific properties of each attack. Which Tekken 8 training feature do you expect to find the most useful? Save States Pinning Moves to the Screen Move Demonstrations Frame Data Punishment Training Replay Takeover Answer See Results But the crown jewel is the integrated replay system. You can watch your own replays back, or even those of other players you find online, and take control of the characters at any time, as long as they were played by a human. That means as soon as you run into a troublesome situation in a match, you can immediately hop into your replays, watch back what you did, and then try a dozen different ways to find something better. It\u2019s a phenomenal addition, and one I\u2019ll be using constantly as I strive to improve. To simplify things even further, there\u2019s also a control mode called Special Style that binds important moves to a single button press. You can even bind the Special Style toggle to a button that you can press mid-match if you\u2019re getting overwhelmed and just want to do something cool and productive \u2013 the menu will pop on screen, even when playing online, so both players will know when someone activates it. The replay mode is a phenomenal addition, and one I'll be using constantly as I strive to improve. \u201c However, Special Style isn\u2019t useful in any way that\u2019s viable competitively. Unlike Street Fighter 6\u2019s comparatively paltry moveset being downsized with its Modern Controls mode, Tekken characters have dozens if not hundreds of moves, and you can\u2019t realistically map a majority of those to four buttons. You can alter some of them by pressing a direction as well, but Special Style is mainly meant for beginners and those who want a quick taste of what a character can do, which it does provide nicely. New Challengers Joining the roster\u2019s returning mainstays are three fighters new to the Tekken series. Victor, the French UN Agent voiced by actor Vincent Cassell, Azucena, the energetic coffee entrepreneur, and the enigmatic Reina. Victor sports some really flashy attacks that look cool as soon as you pick him up, and his vanishing strikes have great mixup and pressure options that are, thankfully, able to be punished if abused too often. His connection to the story is a nice addition to the lore as well, framing him as a character who has been in the background training other longtime roster mainstays. Azucena, as befitting of her occupation, is always moving. Both her personality and moveset are always baiting you to attack, and then hammering you hard for it. She\u2019s destined to be polarizing due to her taunting nature and obvious early strengths, but even after fighting against her many times, I am more excited to learn ways around her pressure than I am frustrated to face her. What We Said About Tekken 7 Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far. \u2013 Darry Huskey, June 2, 2017 Score: 9.5 Note: Since 2020, IGN has scored on a 1-10 scale . Read the full Tekken 7 review The third and most intriguing new character is Reina, who seems to act as a bridge between Tekken 7 and 8 in both gameplay and story. Seemingly appearing from nowhere, she shares many moves with the recently deceased Heihachi, the patriarch of the Mishima family who was killed by Kazuya at the end of Tekken 7, and she\u2019s my favorite addition to the roster by far. She\u2019s aggressive, flashy, and has some simple tools that will be very hard to master. More Than Just Heat Mode Continuing an extremely welcome trend of recent fighting games, Tekken 8 has enough single player content to keep you busy for dozens of hours without ever even touching multiplayer. The cinematic story mode, subtitled The Dark Awakens, is a roughly three-to-four-hour mix of cutscenes and story battles, and while I can\u2019t give away many details, there are a few surprises that should delight longtime Tekken fans, including multiple playable characters. It seems like a good way to showcase Special Style, too, as story weaves in and out of fights and in-game slow motion is used to punctuate big moves \u2013 I actually found using it more enjoyable than the regular controls for most of the story since I wasn\u2019t browsing a move list every time I played as a new character. There\u2019s plenty of time to dig deep and try hard in all the other modes, so I was glad to just be able to have fun quickly for this campaign. Story mode has a few surprises that should delight longtime Tekken fans. \u201c As far as the actual story goes, I mostly enjoyed my time with it. There are some very \u201ccapital A Anime\u201d moments, and not everyone gets a chance to shine, but Bandai Namco gives attention to important character arcs that span several games, and there are clear fan-service moments that land successfully. It\u2019s simple enough to understand as a newcomer, too, as the relationships and stakes are laid out pretty clearly from the jump and the Gallery mode includes several summary videos of past games. One of the only negatives presentation-wise is that the real-time action looks so good that the transitions into pre-rendered cutscenes can sometimes be jarring, especially with some slightly smeary effects and different color grading layered on top of them. In a return to Tekken tradition, there are also character endings for the entire roster that unlock by playing through a quick series of five battles. These are mostly played for goofs, and they do vary in quality, but there are a few that had me legitimately laughing out loud. I won\u2019t spoil any, but make sure you play through Kazuya and Dragunov\u2019s endings in particular for some fun moments. Ronny's Favorite Fighting Games These are not the \"Top 10 Best Fighting Games,\" but games that have great personal significance to me, and ones I'll always come back to.

Arcade Quest is actually my favorite of the single player options; mimicking a crawl through various arcades, your customizable avatar moves through different opponents while slowly learning Tekken 8\u2019s mechanics. You can spend as much time as you want in each location challenging characters, all of whom sport different playstyles to test your mettle against. There\u2019s a passable story that preaches the importance of having fun in a stressful genre, but it really works as a lengthy tutorial for those who may be a bit hesitant to immediately jump online. Arcade Quest gives you a ton of encouragement as you go, and it should provide players intimidated by Tekken\u2019s high difficulty a reason to stick around without meeting some of the vitriol you\u2019d see with real-life bad actors. Super Ghost Battle is a mode in which you can challenge a CPU that\u2019s built from learning actual information about players. You can train your own ghost by fighting against it in order to learn your own tendencies, or even download and play against ghosts from other players. It\u2019s a great way to check yourself as you continue to grow into a given character, and also a fun way to take on other real-life people without having to actually schedule play time. I\u2019ve already had friends tell me that they beat up my ghost in a nice bit of catharsis after I won a set against them online. Which Tekken has the best soundtrack? Tekken Tekken 2 Tekken 3 Tekken 4 Tekken 5 Tekken 6 Tekken 7 Tekken Tag Tournament Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Tekken Revolution Answer See Results The last single player mode of note is the Jukebox. It lets you replace the music for any stage as you see fit, including the track they switch to in the final round, and even includes both some of the menu music and classic tracks from Tekken\u2019s past. And if you don\u2019t feel like fiddling, you can set it to shuffle the soundtracks of Tekkens 1 through 8, Tekken Tag Tournament 1 and 2, and even Tekken Revolution. It\u2019s an embarrassment of riches for longtime fans of the series like me, and a great way to honor its legacy. Plus, now I can listen to the awesome Tekken 3 Character Select music anytime I want. And I want. Please put this in every fighting game. Online The biggest factor in the longevity of any modern fighting game is how well it plays online, and I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s here Tekken 8 trumps Tekken 7 in every way. Based on the limited online time I\u2019ve had pre-launch, netcode seems much improved, and every match I\u2019ve played against someone in the US (even thousands of miles away) has felt great. I also tried my hand against players in South Korea and Europe, and while the quality wasn\u2019t ideal, the matches were definitely playable \u2013 albeit with some jittery artifacts. There are several rollback settings to change the feel of your inputs as well, although I preferred the default. Regardless, it\u2019s great that the option is there if you want it, and Tekken 8 includes cross-play as well! Also, in an extremely welcome change from Tekkens past, online rematches are now considerably faster. Instead of bumping you out to the versus splash screen as you wait for another load, it will put you right back in the action as soon as you confirm a rematch. It\u2019s a great update, and one of those things that makes you forget how long it actually used to take once you get used to it. As far as online modes go, the big focus here is the Tekken Fight Lounge, a battle hub where you can run around with your custom avatar to meet and inspect other players, throw down some emotes, and access all the online options, including Ranked Matches, Quick Matches, Custom Rooms, and the welcome return of Tekken Ball. It\u2019s easy to navigate as you can pop open the menu to quickly hop from room to room, but it\u2019s also just a cool looking space to run around in its own right. And if it\u2019s not for you, you can just as easily find all the online modes from the main menu. Unfortunately, one bizarre omission while in custom rooms is that you can\u2019t spectate matches or go to the practice mode. You can spectate anyone just fine from the Fight Lounge, but if you\u2019re in a room with friends, as of now, there\u2019s no way to watch each other\u2019s matches. Tekken 8 gets so much right about the online experience that this is a weird thing to not have available. Hopefully it gets added in a post-launch patch. Good news! Since launch, spectating in Player Match lobbies is now available. There's no menu option for it, it just puts you in a match when one is starting, but you can view helpful things like the chat, frame data, input history, and player profiles. It's a great update."

I don\u2019t know if the developers used that as a checklist for things to improve in Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, but they may as well have because I\u2019m thrilled to see that they\u2019ve corrected all of those issues, and then some.

Ultimate Skills are new variations of special moves that add all sorts of powerful new properties to existing moves at the cost of 50% of your special meter, with 25% getting refunded if the skill hits. As an example, the Ultimate version of Katalina\u2019s Frozen Blade shoots out a massive blade from full-screen distance that goes through most projectiles and can crumple the opponent and allow her to get a combo if she\u2019s positioned well enough, forcing you to think twice before throwing a projectile at her when she\u2019s got 50 meter. Other characters, like Siegfried, can use the ultimate version of his down special to just straight up carry his opponent from one end of the stage to the other. In addition to that, these moves can also uniquely be used even while on cooldown. It\u2019s just a ton of utility added to every character; there\u2019s a lot of freedom to create new combo routes depending on whether you want big damage, a hard knockdown, or added corner carry; and stacks another layer onto the meter management game, which improves the thoughtful decision making that\u2019s central to any great fighting game. What We Said About Granblue Fantasy Versus Following in the footsteps of BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is one of Arc System Works\u2019 most approachable fighting games yet. It smartly balances considerations for more casual fighting game players without ever stepping on the toes of its hardcore audience. The result is a more grounded and neutral-heavy ArcSys alternative with all of the usual ArcSys flair, which is a fantastic breath of fresh air. Its RPG mode is dull, and its 11 character roster feels way too light, but all things considered, Granblue Fantasy: Versus feels like it could be the start of another special 2D fighting franchise. - Mitchell Saltzman. February 11, 2020.  Score: 9  Read our full Granblue Fantasy Versus Review Bravery Points, meanwhile, are a resource that\u2019s tied specifically to two new abilities: Raging Strikes and Brave Counters. Brave Counters are simple: You press two buttons simultaneously while blocking to push an opponent off of you at the cost of one BP. Raging Strikes, however, are massively powerful attacks that can be used during a blockstring to crush an opponent\u2019s guard if they just sit there blocking. That allows you to follow up with a Raging Chain attack, which in turn enables you to convert that hit into a full combo, even though the opponent blocked the attack. Not only that, but Raging Strike can also be used to continue combos off of far-reaching attacks that wouldn\u2019t typically be comboable. On paper, that may sound busted, but Raging Strikes are very smartly balanced, much like Drive Impacts are in Street Fighter 6. For one, they\u2019re super slow, and if they\u2019re being used predictably you can either just interrupt them with a jab or use a spot dodge that causes a cool looking slowdown effect, giving you plenty of time to do a big punish. The other important wrinkle in all of this is that Bravery Points also dramatically increase your defense if you bank them, so every point you spend means you\u2019ll take more damage from your enemy going forward. So you really have to make sure that you\u2019re using those points to seal out rounds as opposed to using them haphazardly. Sky Scrappers Pretty much everything else is what I remember from playing Granblue back in 2020. Which is to say, it\u2019s a uniquely beginner-friendly fighting game thanks to features like auto combos, easy one-button special move inputs (which also no longer incur added skill-cooldown penalties), and a very measured pace to the action that\u2019s far more akin to Street Fighter than most other ArcSys anime games. What is new for me, as someone who only played Granblue at launch, is the vast majority of the roster: it\u2019s shot up from a paltry 11 to a very respectable cast of 28 thanks to Rising including all of the DLC over the last three years, plus four entirely new characters. Whats your pick for best fighting game of the year? Street Fighter 6 Mortal Kombat 1 Nickelodeon All Star Brawl 2 Pocket Bravery Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising Other (Let us know in the comments) Answer See Results Even as someone who didn\u2019t play the mobile Gacha game and didn\u2019t watch much of the anime, the playable roster in Granblue is stellar. Every character is just bursting with personality, there\u2019s a great spread of different archetypes, the super moves are gorgeous, there are a ton of fun and unique intro exchanges between characters when a match begins, and the character designs themselves are just spectacular. The four brand-new characters \u2013 Nier, Grimm, Anilla, and Siegfried \u2013 all live up to that standard as well. My personal favorite is Siegfried, who is a Dragon Knight infused with dragon blood, and fights with a giant sword that hits like a truck. He\u2019s also able to sacrifice some of his health for a power buff that increases his damage up to three times, boosting his already-insane damage output even higher. Both Nier and Grimmnir are pretty technical characters, with Nier being a puppet character that relies on the position of both herself and her puppet, and Grimmnir being an extremely mobile character who can place down sigils that he can dash through, making for some absolutely wild and flashy-looking combos and set ups.

Ultimate Bandai Namco Super Smash Bros. Melee HAL Laboratory Tekken 7 Bandai Namco Killer Instinct Rare Mortal Kombat 11 NetherRealm Studios Mortal Kombat High Voltage Software Rounding out the newcomers is Anilla, who is much more straightforward, but still packs her own uniquely quirky charm by fighting with a spear that\u2019s bigger than she is, along with an army of sheep that she sends careening into her opponents. She\u2019s adorable. The new characters are at the forefront of Rising\u2019s new Story Mode chapter, which thankfully removes all of the extraneous RPG systems, weapon collecting, and so on. Instead, now you just earn skills that you can equip to your character for some sort of temporary boost or buff. Not that I ever really needed it \u2013 it\u2019s still ridiculously easy \u2013 with even the late-game bosses barely putting up any sort of fight. Ultimately, Story Mode is an improvement over GBFV's RPG Mode, but mostly because its much faster and less arduous to get through it. \u201c The fighting is secondary to the story though, and as far as the story goes, it\u2019s\u2026 fine. There are definitely some funny moments, mostly involving the Lowain trio, but the overarching plot is largely uninteresting and didn\u2019t quite have that big satisfying payoff that I was hoping for, given the buildup to the final few chapters. Ultimately, it\u2019s an improvement over the vanilla GBFV\u2019s RPG Mode, but mostly just because it\u2019s much faster and less arduous to get through it. It took me just about two or three hours to beat the new chapter, which felt like the exact amount of time I wanted to spend with it. . Rising to the Top Rising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus as well. Its training mode and learning tools are all far more fully featured, with a more detailed frame data display; quick character guides that give you an overview of what a character excels at and what buttons you should press at different ranges; and practical combo trials that give you combos for every situation, from anti-airs to counter-hit anti-airs, corners, and combos for when you hit your opponent with a raging strike. I never felt like I needed to search elsewhere to get a baseline level of competency with a new character, which is how a modern fighting game should be. Rising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus. \u201c The charming chibi avatar lobby system also returns from the base game, though this time it\u2019s been greatly expanded to be an actual virtual social hub where you can play soccer, go to the arcade and play a crane game for collectibles, queue up for ranked and casual matchmaking, or park next to one of the seemingly hundreds of arcade cabinets to play with other people in the lobby. It\u2019s not quite as impressive as Street Fighter 6\u2019s Battle Hub, and the performance is a little chuggy once you enter, but it\u2019s still a fun way to meet new players and experience online play in a way that goes beyond just endlessly queuing for matches. Of course, if that is what you want to do, you can still do that too. You don\u2019t have to engage in the lobby at all if you don\u2019t want to. The best thing, though, is the addition of rollback netcode, which at this point should virtually be a requirement for fighting games going forward. Online play feels as smooth as can be, on par with bar-setters like Street Fighter 6, Guilty Gear Strive, and Killer Instinct. Then there\u2019s Grand Bruise, which is \u2013 as crazy as it sounds \u2013 a Fall Guys-inspired game within a game that uses the lobby\u2019s chibi anime avatars in a platforming battle royale mode. And you know what? It\u2019s pretty fun! It combines Mario Kart-style item pickups with frantic platforming footraces, resulting in an absolutely chaotic mode that had me shouting and hollering in exactly the same ways that Fall Guys does. It\u2019s very obvious that Bruise is not meant to be a main attraction \u2013 there\u2019s no ability to create a custom lobby, there\u2019s only a paltry number of minigames to play right now, and some of those, like a wave based survival minigame, go on for a bit too long. Still, it\u2019s a fun diversion, and is especially a nice addition for those who opt for the free version of Rising, which includes Grand Bruise and a rotating selection of three playable characters, plus Gran."

        "Content": "Ticket to Ride is a phenomenon. The original board game achieved the unthinkable, breaking out of nerd space and into the almost unassailable world of family board game fun and supermarket shelves, selling millions of copies in the process. Along the way, it\u2019s spawned a whole host of different versions and expansions, becoming a mini-industry in its own right. This latest iteration, Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West is a whole new spin on the classic board game , creating a campaign of rail building which lasts across twelve games, with changes from the previous game carrying on into the next. What\u2019s in the Box Ticket to Ride: Legends of the West comes in a truly massive box, especially compared to previous Ticket to Ride games. Sadly, we\u2019re not allowed to tell you very much about the contents because most of it is closed away in individual boxes which you open as you progress through the game. We\u2019re going to try and avoid spoilers in this review, although there might be one or two very minor ones for your first play, so we\u2019re not going to talk about what\u2019s inside. What you are allowed to open and sort will be familiar to fans of the series. There are bags of plastic trains in five different colors, each with its own design. There are decks of ticket and train cards with all-new art, which you separate and file with dividers in a supplied box that lets you store new components as they\u2019re revealed. The graphic design on all the components fits in with the classic Ticket to Ride look and feel while giving it a fresh, Western-themed twist.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Other aspects are fresh, even to veteran players. The board isn\u2019t fold-out any more, but a jigsaw affair that you piece together, allowing you to add pieces as your rail lines extend out into the frontiers of the wild west. There\u2019s also a whole new deck called postcards, which are a key engine in adding new aspects to the game as you play through, although how they work isn\u2019t explained until the end of your first session. Rules and How It Plays The core gameplay loop of Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West will be familiar to fans of the franchise and easy enough to be a board game for kids . On most of your turns you\u2019ll be collecting colored train cards either blind from the deck or from a face-up selection. Your aim is to get a set that matches the colour and length of a train route printed on the board, which you can then claim by playing the cards and putting your colored plastic train pieces down on the spaces. The final action is to take tickets, cards which you hold in secret, and indicate cities on the board that you\u2019ll want to connect with routes to earn bonus points. Failing to connect the cities on one of your tickets means you lose the points rather than gain them. There\u2019s a good reason why these core concepts have remained unchanged, and that\u2019s because they\u2019re a brilliant, addictive mix that have sustained the series through over a dozen spin-offs and expansions. Hunting for the cards you need through the face-up and face-down selection is filled with frustration, anticipation, and joy when you find the final piece. Claiming routes is always thrilling, as you wait to see if one of the other players will sneak in before you, forcing you to try and route around. Spotting someone else\u2019s likely destination and blocking them on purpose is supremely satisfying. It\u2019s a family-weight tactical delight, full of excitement and skill in equal measure, and it's as fun here as it's ever been. It\u2019s a family-weight tactical delight, full of excitement and skill in equal measure. \u201c Of course, given the radical nature of changing the formula into a campaign game, there are lots of new aspects to explore. You now earn money rather than points and there are no default dollars in claiming routes like the original. Instead, you get two dollars for claiming a route that matches your player color, and a bonus card if one of the cities connected has a large city icon. The number of train pieces you play with starts small and increases as the campaign goes on. The train deck has several newspaper cards in it that mean an event is revealed when drawn, with effects like offering a small bonus to players who\u2019ve completed tickets early. Learning and anticipating possible events provides a minor extra strategic game plank to the play. However, the main engines of novelty here are the story and postcard decks. The former contains cards that are read at before and after each game in the series, offering a rather silly, faux-historical narrative framework to enjoy and sometimes some new rules to incorporate. Postcards can be collected after the first game by completing certain tickets, giving an additional frisson to players who manage to finish, or to fail, those tickets. Each postcard offers a reward to its owner for achieving its listed objective. These objectives sometimes tie in with mechanics not yet revealed by the story deck, which can get marginally confusing. As the campaign progresses, some new elements also introduce additional mechanics and mini-games for the players to compete in. We\u2019re not going to offer any more detail for fear of spoilers, but suffice to say that these are hugely imaginative and enjoyable, offering all sorts of clever twists and turns on the core concepts of the series while not overwhelming players with new rules. Some are more tactical or strategic than others, but they\u2019re all great fun. The mini-games offer you new ways to score points, some of which are independent of the main board, while others will change that board permanently and impact future games. All of them are a delight to open and explore, giving a thrill of anticipation to each new element. As you might be beginning to glean, completing the campaign is central to Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West. At the beginning you're given a box in your player color in which you store components you need to keep between games and also a scoresheet to record your profits at the end of each play. When you\u2019ve completed 12 games, you add up those profits, plus extras from mini-games and stored cards, to find an overall winner. This ultimate thrill comes with a price, however, which is that it\u2019s unsatisfying for players to drop in and out between sessions if they can\u2019t make it. There are rules to cover this, but they\u2019re a little awkward, and you\u2019ll get the most out of your campaign if the same group of players can be present at every game. The original legacy campaign game, based on Risk, felt daringly transgressive with its instructions to tear up cards and scrawl on the board. The fashion has moved on to more \u201cresettable\u201d campaigns, but Ticket to Ride: Legacy sees you making permanent changes, resulting in a version of the game that\u2019s unique to you. While it\u2019s good to see this back, those changes feel less personal than they did in the earliest legacy games, and some of the mini-games are gone forever once they\u2019re over. So it\u2019s questionable how often your group might continue playing once the twelve games are up.

Continuing that trend, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is very aptly named because, quite simply, it is full of wonder. Literally wonderful! Every frame oozes joy, from its bright colors to the Flower Kingdom\u2019s ubiquitous talking flower, who\u2019s never lacking in words of encouragement as you run and jump through dozens upon dozens of stages that are altered by unpredictable and often grin-inducing Wonder effects and, more often than not, the antics of Mario himself. Whether you enjoy it solo or with up to three friends, there\u2019s a lot to love about Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Wonder catches the eye immediately. It dazzles due to its typical and welcome use of a wide variety of colors, with a particular emphasis on vivid blues, reds, greens, and yellows. But it\u2019s particularly impressive in motion.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Animations are the undeniable standout here: Mario reaches back for his hat when he dashes into pipes, critters\u2019 eyes bulge in fear as they run in terror from a pursuing plumber, Goombas have snot bubbles on their nostrils as they nap, Elephant Mario squeezes his giant, round body into warp pipes and \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 tries to make himself as small as he can when crouching under a low row of blocks. There are so many more! Those touches go a long way toward bringing Mario\u2019s first trip to the Flower Kingdom to life. You can already guess: Mario finds himself caught up in another Bowser caper. \u201c What is the Flower Kingdom? It\u2019s a neighbor to the familiar Mushroom Kingdom, and it proved to be a refreshing setting mostly because it brought so many new and unique enemies for Mario to stomp on. Story-wise, you can already guess: A visiting Mario finds himself caught up in another Bowser caper, of course, as the reptile uses the land\u2019s Wonder powers to fuse himself with the kingdom\u2019s primary castle, making life miserable for its inhabitants. As always, the story is paper (Mario) thin, and you know you\u2019re going to fight Bowsers Junior along the way.

Wonder Nintendo EAD 9 Super Mario Sunshine Nintendo EAD 10 Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury Nintendo EAD Tokyo But it leaves no cloud hanging over the Flower Kingdom, because the dozens of stages across six main worlds \u2013 along with the Petal Isles hub that contains stages of its own \u2013 offer so many different looks and wild hooks that the typically forgettable story simply didn\u2019t matter. Most levels include at least two Wonder Seeds, with one of them at the end and another hidden somewhere within it. Getting access to that hidden seed usually involves finding a Wonder Flower \u2013 sometimes hidden in blocks, bad guys, or in secret areas \u2013 that makes something unexpected happen. Sadly I\u2019m not allowed to show you most of the best ones, but Mario might transform into a rolling spiky ball, or the camera might shift to a top-down perspective, or Mario and his enemies alike might morph into stretchy ink silhouettes, or he might turn into a Goomba who can\u2019t jump or attack, or there might be a dance party. You just never know what will happen next. As such, I looked forward to the Wonder effects on every stage. They\u2019re so much fun to experience that if I missed one in a level, I had plenty of motivation to run back in to find it. In short, the Wonders make the game. In short, the Wonder effects make the game. \u201c It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that each world packs entirely different groups of enemies that include mostly new foes, but with some callbacks to both staple classics like the cloud-riding Lakitus and deeper cuts like the Pokeys from Super Mario Bros. 2. Among the newbies, the Bulrushes come rushing at you and cannot be defeated by traditional stomping. But they can be ridden, which Wonder takes clever advantage of. The derpy looking Maw-Maws, meanwhile, look sweet, chill, and innocent \u2013 until they spot you, at which point their gaping maws open wide and will swallow you whole if you don\u2019t jump very high very quickly. The Mumsies, on the other hand, pose little threat aside from their difficult-to-leap-over height, and I never got tired of grabbing onto their loose piece of cloth and unraveling them into oblivion. I hope we get to see the Flower Kingdom again someday because I don\u2019t want this to be the only appearance for this fresh group of interesting new enemies. Actually, We Need the Stinkin\u2019 Badges Another wrinkle in the 2D Mario formula comes in the form of Badges, a group of roughly two dozen unlockable active or passive effects you can choose to take into each level. Boosting Spin Jump lets you tap the right shoulder button to effectively double jump. Grappling Vine means even Mario games have grappling hooks now, Safety Bounce will let you survive a fall into lava, and Sensor pings more frequently as you get closer to key objects like large purple coins and (crucially) Wonder Flowers. These Badges give you some welcome control over how you tackle stages in a way that best suits your playstyle, not to mention offering a bit of replayability as a cherry on top.

By comparison, buying a Badge with purple coins was unsatisfying, especially considering I was never short on them \u2013 I wish each of them had a fun challenge associated with it instead of just some of them. The online component is surprisingly seamlessly integrated. \u201c Speaking of new additions, Super Mario Bros. Wonder offers familiar four-player local and brand-new online multiplayer, with the online component being surprisingly seamlessly integrated. I don\u2019t see it as appointment multiplayer gaming \u2013 couch co-op is still where it\u2019s at in any multiplayer Mario game \u2013 but it works, and the friend races you can initiate on most stages can be a fun distraction from the primary platforming action. And whether you play on the same screen together or online, it is nice to see Nintendo put forth a more concerted effort to make multiplayer feel like a more organic part of the platforming, rather than a tacked-on afterthought, through things like Standees \u2013 which let you leave respawn points for your friends \u2013 and turning your pals into Ghosts that won\u2019t physically get in your way during a precise jump or maneuver. Smart Like an Elephant But let me circle back to Elephant Mario for a second. Is he explained? Does he make any sense at all? Does it matter? No. Is he awesome? Yes. He is a dominant, Shaq-like force in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, complete with absolutely hilarious animations. A tap of the Y button sends smaller foes flying away when he swipes at them with his trunk. He can hold water in said trunk, too, dousing hot blocks and watering thirsty plants where needed. His sheer bulk even allows him to smash bricks with his trunk. He\u2019s just a blast. Drill Mario is also a welcome addition. With a drill bit on his hat, he can burrow into the ground \u2013 or the ceiling! \u2013 to access hidden areas and spring up from below on unsuspecting bad guys. Elephant Mario is a dominant, Shaq-like force, complete with absolutely hilarious animations. \u201c I can\u2019t quite say the same for Bubble Mario. He blows large bubbles that can snag coins, slightly home in on and ensnare enemies, and be used as jumping pads, which is all useful enough. But when given the choice of which Mario form I wanted to take (just like in past Mario games, you can keep a powerup in reserve to switch back and forth as needed), I typically opted for Elephant Mario or good ol\u2019 Fire Mario. Top 10 Super Mario Games 11 Images Despite the joy radiating from most of the 2D Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it\u2019s not quite up to par with the last mainline 3D Mario masterpiece, Super Mario Odyssey. The music, while not at all bad, is surprisingly forgettable this time around, and while there are some five-star difficulty stages \u2013 including an entire group of them I won\u2019t spoil here \u2013 Wonder is a bit light on the challenge side of things, so there\u2019s not as much here for seasoned series veterans as its predecessor has. Though in fairness, Mario is for everyone, and my daughter appreciated the inclusion of Nabbit as a playable character \u2013 when we played together, enemies couldn\u2019t hurt her and we had more fun progressing through many of the stages. I nevertheless remain hungry for Mario\u2019s next 3D adventure, especially as I watch the calendar surpass six years since Odyssey."

As you progress through the relatively short five or six-hour story, the orb-worlds unveil special powers; revealing hidden paths, changing the state of objects between gaseous and solid, and other abilities that provide solutions to puzzles that were impossible before.

With only one button, the team at Geometric went above and beyond in designing some intense, engaging combat scenarios without sacrificing Cocoon's adventurous, curious feel. Puzzling out the patterns of the bosses takes the interactions you've learned with different objects and turns them upside down \u2013 carrying a ball and timing out when to cross a platform becomes holding an explosive flower and dodging the crystal structures one boss leaves in its path in an almost rhythm game-like fashion. Don't let combat fool you; Cocoon is a puzzler through and through. \u201c Don't let those combat sections fool you, though; Cocoon is a puzzler through and through. With the orbs being both the worlds the levels are contained in and batteries for the technology within them, this is a game that\u2019s ready to bend reality and challenge you in the best of ways. These puzzles are no joke, especially if you find yourself stuck \u2013 with little but trial and error, some of them can feel like you're retracing your steps over and over again as you try and swap between orbs one at a time. Eventually, though, the hints contained in the level design become clearer; a color-coded pathway will appear, or the rock formations in the distance will be covered in moss to give you a clue about which orb to use. But it\u2019s not obvious, to the point where there were a couple times where I was convinced that I had somehow broken a puzzle by placing some objects in the wrong spot and sealing certain pathways off by doing so. Every time, though, I was able to find my way through before my patience ran out; sometimes, the spots where I felt way off course even ended up being vital solutions to the puzzle! Cocoon - Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 11 Images A subtle bit of encouragement comes in the form of musical cues and triumphant swells that occur as you get closer and closer to the solution, cheering you on the whole time and adding to the feeling of discovery and accomplishment you feel once you finally crack the puzzle. It's a strange feeling, but rewarding nonetheless. \u201c Right before the repetition and feeling of walking the same paths back and forth starts to wear thin, Cocoon loops around from the verge of frustration to an almost Zen-like experience. You\u2019re introduced to new and exciting concepts that eventually become natural and easy; what was once an entire solution is now barely even a piece of a much larger puzzle. The absence of any overt guidance as I made my way through this wordless story made it feel like the cicada is being compelled by some force, natural or otherwise, to complete its task. All of this is this little guy\u2019s role in the universe \u2013 even if we don't know exactly what we're doing, we're helping him push forward and discovering the larger meaning of these puzzles as we do. As things click together, it starts feeling like the times I figured out why an old boss of mine would have me do a bunch of seemingly pointless, disconnected tasks, only to find out later that each of those tasks was part of a project so large I couldn\u2019t see the shape of it at the time. It's a strange feeling, but rewarding nonetheless.

It\u2019s not unlike the feeling of getting the hang of Portal, where suddenly there\u2019s an entirely new way of thinking about what\u2019s possible in a space. Once you start bouncing between each world, bringing one orb into another and using its abilities to trigger something you couldn't before, everything really starts to click; the depth of what's going on here is easy to miss, thanks to the simplified control scheme and deceptively uncomplicated art style, but the way you can seamlessly hop in and out of different worlds \u2013 and even place a world within a world in order to solve certain puzzles \u2013 is really something to behold. Despite that layered and compounding challenge, Cocoon doesn't last very long at all \u2013 my first playthrough took a crisp five and a half hours, though it also contains plenty of replay value in finding the hidden Moon Ancestor collectibles tucked away in each world. Each of these collectibles are incredibly well hidden, but the feeling of intrigue I got while finding them (and the achievements you get for them) compelled me to find more whenever I could. Even though I wasn't able to find them all, the feeling of the few that I did find blew me away; I'll definitely be coming back to find the rest."

        "Content": "When you look back at the history of new games and their sequels, oftentimes it\u2019s not until the second attempt at a bold new idea that things really hit their stride. Following in the footsteps of breakthrough sequels like Borderlands 2 and Assassin\u2019s Creed 2 before it, Remnant 2 iterates on the original to phenomenal effect. Combat is even smoother and more satisfying, loot and buildcrafting have been greatly improved to allow for countless possibilities and reasons to grind, boss fights have been completely overhauled to ditch spongy bosses aided by endless waves of minions, and each of the realms feel diverse and brimming with things to do and secrets to uncover. But procedurally generated, impressively replayable levels remain its killer feature, and here they have been improved in so many ways that it's alarmingly easy to lose half a day by jumping back into the same area just to see other possibilities. We don\u2019t have to wait for the next one: when it comes to games, the second time\u2019s the charm. Back in 2019 a lot of us, myself included, lovingly referred to the original Remnant: From The Ashes as \u201cDark Souls with guns,\u201d and the sequel seems to nod in violent agreement with that characterization. You and up to two allies will navigate gloriously hazardous areas packed with devilish enemies who make short work of anyone without the skill or patience to overcome its intentionally challenging levels. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask All the familiar soulslike ideas are present and accounted for, from limited-use healing items to enemies who respawn whenever you rest at a checkpoint, but like the first game, Remnant 2 doesn\u2019t content itself with throwing a science-fiction skin onto a tried-and-true formula. Instead, it expertly blends the best parts of fellow co-op looter shooters like Borderlands and Outriders, including an extraordinarily deep loot grind and buildcrafting, and adds plenty of interesting twists that are all its own, like procedurally generated levels and a strong set of diverse worlds for you and your teammates to jump between. The result is a unique hodgepodge of great ideas that go together like peanut butter and chocolate, but with a whole lot more shooting monsters in the face and getting murdered by blobs of sentient meat. What\u2019s not to love? Remnant 2 doesn\u2019t content itself with throwing a science-fiction skin onto a tried-and-true formula. \u201c Just like its predecessor, the surreal story has you playing as a nameless survivor in a post-apocalyptic Earth where a race of evil trees called The Root are attempting to take over the multiverse. Super weird, right? That setup is mostly used to justify you teleporting to different realities to do really awesome looter-shooter stuff and save the day, but it only ever becomes slightly more interesting than that one-sentence premise. You get to chat with new and returning characters at your base, Ward 13, (most of whom have a lot to say while giving you as little actual information as possible), learn more about The Root and what\u2019s going on with the multiversal war, and eventually come to a dramatic conclusion that\u2019s immediately reversed so that you can continue playing without dealing with the consequences of the finale. It\u2019s not that the writing is bad \u2013 in fact, some of it is quite good and there\u2019s definitely some interesting concepts at play here that the community will doubtless be crafting theories about in the weeks and months ahead \u2013 it\u2019s just that very little of that has any impact on your blank slate of a character, and it\u2019s all so high-concept it often doesn\u2019t gel with an adventure that\u2019s so squarely focused on shooting alien lobsters in the thorax. What's the most important part of a good soulslike? Fighting interesting bosses Discovering deeply buried secrets Getting humbled by difficult encounters Optimizing character builds Getting up to no good with friends Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results The good news is that the different worlds you travel to on your journey contain bite-sized stories of their own, which are expertly told and far more compelling than your main quest. You might find yourself in a high-fantasy world of elves trying to solve a murder mystery, or aboard a starship helping a huge Gundam Wing-looking robot recover his lost cargo. Not only are those stories better, but you also spend the vast majority of your time in those worlds resolving them rather than concerning yourself with the main story. It\u2019s just a shame that anytime I was back on Earth or dealing with the primary conflict my eyes glossed over while I listened to rambling from characters I felt I barely knew at all. No matter which stretch of the adventure you\u2019re working your way through, though, every second of its challenging gunplay is a total blast. Every new area is a dramatic dance of shooting, dodging, making clever use of abilities, and doing your best to not get surrounded by whatever relentless enemy is trying their best to maim and dismember you. What starts as a relatively simple toolbox containing a primary and secondary weapon, something to swing in melee combat, and a single archetype skill quickly spirals into a treasure trove of weapons, armor, highly customizable character classes, and mods that hasn\u2019t come close to feeling stale after my first few dozen hours. Combat hasn\u2019t come close to feeling stale after my first few dozen hours. \u201c A major part of what makes combat continuously feel so fresh is that you keep hopping between different worlds in the multiverse, each with their own distinct feel and new enemies to battle. One of them, N\u2019Erud, is a sci-fiction reality filled with violent robots, electronic gizmos, and laser guns, while Losomn is a fantasy realm with cockney elves who wear bowler hats and try to cut your throat in between what I can only assume are their busy chimney-sweeping schedules. The worlds are so starkly distinct that sometimes I could hardly believe I was still in the same game I\u2019d been playing just minutes prior. It's quite jarring \u2013 in a good way that makes each transition between them memorable \u2013 to go from battling stone golems in a multiversal labyrinth to hunting beasties in a lush, primordial forest, and the novelty of that hasn\u2019t gotten old one bit. It certainly helps that every area is jam-packed with optional quests to tackle, secret areas to explore, and an extremely surprising number of legitimately challenging puzzles to noodle on. Remnant 2 Slideshow 16 Images Really, the only thing that nags at me about combat is that, despite there being a handful of very different worlds to explore, most of them only have a handful of unique enemy types to fight, so you end up fighting a lot of the same brand of baddies all in a row. It\u2019s not that enemy diversity is weak overall, because taken as a whole there are probably more types in Remnant 2 than in most games, but since they\u2019re divided among so many worlds and you typically spend about five or six hours at a stretch going through each one, I did get a tad bit tired of seeing the same group of flying gargoyles and armored knights in the world of Losomn for so long. However, moving on to the next area quickly washes away any would-be monotony. Remnant 2 counts its boss fights as one of its main strengths. \u201c Each world also includes, as you\u2019d expect, a bunch of boss battles, and this is one of those areas where you can tell that the developers listened to community feedback about the first Remnant\u2019s boss fights lacking any real personality. Often they\u2019d pit you against a forgettable enemy and then throw massive amounts of henchmen at you to artificially inflate the encounter\u2019s difficulty. I\u2019m extremely happy to report that Remnant 2 has not only corrected this weakness, but now counts its boss fights as one of its main strengths. What We Said About Remnant: From The Ashes Remnant: From the Ashes delivers a beautifully deranged vision of the apocalypse overflowing with twisted creatures hellbent on making you suffer. The thrill of finally beating a boss that\u2019s had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall it\u2019s a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over. \u2013 David Jagneaux, August 20, 2019 Score: 8 Read the full Remnant: From the Ashes review While there are certainly some uninspired fights, like a random lady who throws Molotov cocktails at you and a blob monster who\u2019s just a beefier version of an existing enemy you see a lot already, the vast majority are not only delightfully difficult tests of your skill and your character\u2019s build, but also have plenty of interesting mechanics. There\u2019s one fight where looking at the boss for a few seconds makes your character go mad and die so you have to quickly turn your back while you compose yourself, and another where a ghost traps you in a haunted house and pops out of the walls to scratch your face off. My personal favorite is an unforgettable encounter where you become trapped in a maze and have to physically fight the labyrinth itself as you navigate it and avoid getting crushed by giant cubes. In fact, that encounter might be my new favorite boss fight in any game, period \u2013 it\u2019s that good. This might be my new favorite boss fight in any game, period \u2013 it\u2019s that good. \u201c In order to stay ahead of the increasingly powerful enemies and boss fights that Remnant 2 has in store, you\u2019ll need to spend a lot of time gleefully optimizing your build. The most significant and exciting decision you\u2019ll make \u2013 and then constantly iterate upon \u2013 is your archetype (aka your class). At the start you\u2019ll pick from four core archetypes including a support-focused Medic, a badass close-quarters tank called the Challenger, a long-range sniper and scout called the Hunter, and the Handler, which gives you an extremely useful dog companion. The Hunter, for example, has an ability that highlights all enemies on the battlefield and a passive perk that makes critical hits extend the duration of any skills they\u2019ve got equipped, while the Challenger can do an area-of-effect war stomp at enemies in front of them and automatically gets back up after taking fatal damage. Leveling up your archetype unlocks new possibilities too, from perks that affect you and any teammates in your group, to bonuses that trigger for a limited time after you use your relic \u2013 your consumable healing item that\u2019s the equivalent to Elden Ring\u2019s Flask of Crimson Tears. Remnant 2 sagely allows you to switch archetypes at will, so you\u2019re free to experiment and level up every role on a single character instead of restarting from scratch. But the real fun comes once you unlock the ability to simultaneously equip a second archetype in the middle of the campaign; this opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Equipping The Handler and The Hunter at the same time, for example, has some great synergy where you can direct your furry ally to distract and obstruct the enemy while you pick them off with a sniper from a distance. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images Better still, there are an unknown amount of other archetypes you can unlock by completing specific quests hidden throughout the fractured worlds you\u2019ll journey through. In one area, I made an offering to a secret vendor that granted me the fantastic Summoner archetype, turning me into a monster summoning witch. In another, I tracked down an elusive enemy that gave me the consumable-focused Alchemist archetype, which allowed me to use powerful thrown concoctions to control the battlefield. It took me a dozen hours of hunting just to find the handful of archetypes I discovered and there are undoubtedly plenty I still haven\u2019t found, and searching for these awesome game-changers has me practically foaming at the mouth. Beyond archetypes, there\u2019s an absolute ton of weapons, rings, amulets, and armor to round out your build, and half a dozen ways you can further modify and upgrade your equipment to your exact liking. It\u2019s a veritable buildcrafter\u2019s Shangri-La, and with most of the equipment being hidden throughout the world (including many that are locked behind obscure secret puzzles and quests) and others that drop from powerful enemies, there\u2019s always a reason to get back out there and explore. All of this combines into some of the most spellbinding combat I\u2019ve seen in a looter-shooter in a long time, and I spent way too many hours just experimenting with different permutations of my loadout and hunting for new tools to add to my collection. In fact, I somehow have more than 80 rings so far \u2013 and I get the sense I\u2019m not even close to finding them all! There is one major disappointment in Remnant 2\u2019s buildcrafting, however, and that\u2019s in the quite underwhelming armor. While there are plenty of sets to find or purchase from vendors, there aren\u2019t any ways to improve or customize armor in the same way you can with weapons, mods, and practically every other facet. It\u2019s an especially surprising omission considering Remnant: From The Ashes has an armor upgrading system that allows you to invest in your favorite sets and improve your resistances and armor. I miss that. You\u2019ll end up in different worlds in a different order, fight different bosses, and find completely different quests. \u201c While it only took me 20 hours to \u201ccomplete\u201d Remnant 2, that\u2019s only the beginning of the time I\u2019ll actually spend playing it. One of this series\u2019 characteristics \u2013 virtually unique within its genre \u2013 is its procedurally generated levels, storylines, and sidequests that make each run feel different. It\u2019s both impressively unpredictable and so well organized that you could play through all of Remnant 2 without knowing that anything wasn\u2019t hand-built\u2026 right up until you talk to your friend about your respective playthroughs and almost immediately realize that you aren\u2019t playing the same campaign. You\u2019ll almost certainly end up in different worlds in a different order, fight different bosses, and find completely different quests. That\u2019s possible because every world contains two possible storylines and various other permutations along the way. This isn\u2019t just a matter of rooms being haphazardly stitched together to add minimal diversity in lieu of unique content \u2013 the differences between each run can be so dramatic they hardly even feel like they\u2019re part of the same world. TieGuyTravis' Favorite Soulslikes See All 1 Elden Ring FromSoftware 2 Dark Souls III FromSoftware 3 Dark Souls FromSoftware 4 Remnant II Gunfire Games 5 Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Respawn 6 Hyper Light Drifter Abylight 7 Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice FromSoftware 8 Demon's Souls SIE Japan Studio 9 The Surge 2 Deck 13 10 Lies of P Neowiz In one playthrough of a realm called Yaesha, I spent almost the entire time indoors traipsing through dark corridors full of crazed cultists, while on another I found myself in dense woods with a blood-red moon looming overhead, and in another still I was lost amid a maze of hovering platforms, surrounded by floating aliens who bombarded me with plasma projectiles. In one run of the fantasy world Losomn, I spent my entire run among the slums and sewers of that world\u2019s lower class, fighting off vandals and ne\u2019er-do-wells; in another I spent most of my time in the gilded palaces of the noble elites, fighting winged angels and armored paladins. They\u2019re almost entirely different. You don\u2019t have to start a new campaign to experience them, though. After you\u2019ve beaten the final boss on your first playthrough of any given world you can immediately and infinitely reroll that area any time you want, generating new possibilities and a fresh set of quests to complete along with it. At a minimum, you\u2019d need to run through each world two times just to see all the major stuff. And even if you manage to get some of the same sidequests multiple times, as I sometimes did, you can make a different decision at the end to see what would have happened (and which rewards you would gain) had you let things go the other way. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen a more effective and creative use of procedural generation before, and the near-perfect execution in that regard makes Remnant 2 ridiculously replayable. Speaking of different worlds, since this is a cooperative multiplayer game you can hop into one of your friends' worlds to help them out, gain XP, and share in their rewards, and see how different their worlds are from yours. Playing in co-op is an expectedly good time, though it does come with worse performance than in solo play (playing on PC I saw more frequent framerate hitches and occasional disconnects) and some questionable enemy scaling that can make combat less welcoming to groups. It\u2019s a bit of a bummer, for example, that I was breezing through one area in solo play, then got utterly hammered when I invited two of my lower-level friends to join me. Whatever level adjusting happens behind the scenes at least ensures lower-level players won\u2019t immediately get torn apart when joining a higher-level player, but it definitely makes it much harder for the whole group to succeed by bumping up enemy health and damage output by a whole heck of a lot. You\u2019d think with drop-in/drop-out co-op, a game would want to welcome newcomers to join their friends and with the current damage scaling it makes them more likely to just get frustrated and leave. (Also, it\u2019s worth noting that Remnant 2 does not currently support cross-play between PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions.)"

While the earliest hours started out slower than I would have liked, it reminded me of an onion \u2013 in the best kind of way \u2013 in that every layer I peeled back added more and more depth, eventually growing into the best version of the idea at the heart of it. Not all of it is as challenging as I\u2019d have liked, but with twice as many enemy types and nearly four times the amount of hidden treasures I loved gathering in past games \u2013 along with its fantastic musical score, improved graphics, and next-level post-game content \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t put it down until finishing everything it had to offer. Right from the very start, there\u2019s a series first: While previous games have starred fan-favorite heroes such as Olimar and Louie, Pikmin 4 allows you to customize your character\u2019s hair, body type, and suit color. Though it\u2019s not the most spectacular character creator next to something like Street Fighter 6 , it\u2019s a nice touch as your color choices apply to your ship and everybody in your space crew as well. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask However, I spent far more time taking in the beautiful worlds of Pikmin 4 than checking out my own character. Pikmin 4 continues the series\u2019 tradition of playing as an alien the size of an ant exploring an Earth-like planet that is probably actually Earth. Charmingly most of the treasures you end up collecting are named after their appearance, so \u201cSpace Spinners\u201d and \u201cthe Stone of Advancement\u201d are really just fidget spinners and a Game Boy Advance SP. Thanks to all of the Pikmin games being made available on the Switch, it made it very easy to see just how far the series has come. Pikmin may not be as popular as Nintendo\u2019s other biggest names, but what it often lacks in mainstream popularity is the intensity that some fans have for the series including renting out ad space on a billboard in Times Square to promote it . Everything from the soil on the ground to the foliage everywhere on the maps is vibrant, and each location feels distinct. A simple garden filled with (literally) larger-than-life insects and flowers that tower over you is filled with obstacles like a broken potted plant that blocks a passage and a puddle in the dirt that becomes a small lake. A sandy beach reveals new paths to navigate and enemies to battle after the tide recedes, and a house with multiple sets of stairs becomes mountainlike until you find a way to create ramps so your tiny followers can recover the treasures hidden inside. If you could have one type of Pikmin in real life which one would you choose? Red Yellow Blue Rock Purple White Winged Ice Glow Answer See Results Much of the fun and strategy of Pikmin games comes from collecting and commanding different types of obedient little plant creatures to do your bidding, and generally avoiding sending them to their doom. It\u2019s not a full-on real-time strategy game like StarCraft, since there\u2019s no base-building and outside of the newly added night missions you don\u2019t have to worry about an enemy army attacking you back, but there\u2019s always a lot happening on screen when you have dozens of these multicolored minions doing things like digging tunnels and carrying treasures and you\u2019re literally hurling them into combat. For those jumping into Pikmin for the first time, it can seem like a lot, especially with nine types of cutesy creatures to master, having to split your attention between multiple objectives, and learning to manage your resources. To its great credit, Pikmin 4 does a gentle job of rolling out new Pikmin, items, and abilities at a pace that won\u2019t overwhelm with too many options too soon. Your first steps onto this world come with a large number of tutorials and explanations \u2013 though someone like myself, who has been playing Pikmin games for 22 years, may not be able to skip the dialogue fast enough because it rarely covers anything we don\u2019t already know. Pikmin 4 won\u2019t overwhelm with too many options too soon. \u201c One of the most immediately noticeable differences between Pikmin 4 and its predecessors is that here there\u2019s no limit to the number of days you have to finish the story like in the original, nor is there any threat of running out of supplies like in Pikmin 3, making it more of a casual rescue mission than a race against the clock. This decision is especially great for newcomers because it removes the pressure or worry of doing something wrong and being punished for the rest of your playthrough, but I enjoyed it too because it allowed me to tackle objectives in any order I liked and fulfill my inner need to see that 100% completion on each stage. It\u2019s comparable to how Dead Rising removed its time limit in the fourth game in recognition of the fact that, more often than not, people play games to escape from the tension of impending deadlines that haunt us in school or work. The Top 25 Switch Games 26 Images Even without a lot of time pressure, mistakes will still happen: maybe you\u2019ll misjudge an enemy attack range and become frozen, allowing a nearby enemy to crush or devour your Pikmin before you can react, or maybe you\u2019ll just accidentally chuck a few Pikmin off the map while you were trying to toss them at a piece of treasure hanging from a spiderweb to weight it down and break the web so you can bring it back to your ship. In previous games careless errors like these would\u2019ve meant spending precious time replenishing Pikmin before you can progress, but in Pikmin 4 we get a handy feature that can bail you out: Until you finish the current day, you can choose to rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. It\u2019s effectively a method of quickly reloading a checkpoint save, and as a perfectionist at heart, I found myself taking advantage of this system constantly in order to maximize my efficiency or save my valuable purple and white Pikmin that are scarce early on. It makes much more sense to retry a section rather than spending a chunk of my time the next day replacing Pikmin I lost. You can rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. \u201c The ability to rewind extends right up to the end of your expedition, which is a huge relief \u2013 if you have played Pikmin before, you are aware of how stressful it can be when that 10-second warning appears, signaling the end of the day, while you still have 60+ Pikmin carrying multiple objects from different locations. In Pikmin 4, if you are unable to gather them all before nightfall it will tell you how many you stand to lose if you choose to continue, but ask if you would like to rewind time to one of the checkpoints to try again instead. This was a huge time-saver and kept me from having to replay entire levels when I\u2019d only messed up the home stretch. What We Said About Pikmin 3 Deluxe Pikmin 3 Deluxe makes an already excellent game even better and transplants it onto a console where far more people have a chance to see how good it really is. Its Side Stories and difficulty modes aren\u2019t massive additions, but they gave me more of the already clever and fast-paced fun that made me fall in love with the original game seven years ago. And while not as flashy new missions, there are a downright impressive amount of smaller touches and quality-of-life adjustments throughout (including replacing the Wii U\u2019s Gamepad screen with Switch-friendly controls) that make this the best the Pikmin series has ever felt. There\u2019s plenty of reason to come back for returning players, and if you missed Pikmin 3 on the Wii U then you absolutely shouldn\u2019t repeat that mistake here. \u2013 Tom Marks, October 28, 2020 Score: 9 Read the full Pikmin 3 Deluxe review Among the many things to keep track of in Pikmin 4 is a wonderful new companion: the two-legged lil\u2019 pup Oatchi. He can carry you and your entire army of Pikmin on his back across obstacles like water, sniff out hidden items, and grant you the ability to jump to help you reach shortcuts and items like never before. His upgradable abilities gave me another reason to seek out crew members lost on the planet, because the reward for finding them is ability points that let you increase everything from his ability to carry heavy objects to improving his dig speeds. Those upgrades all felt impactful, though some, like having him fetch Pikmin for me, became obsolete once I unlocked the ability to summon them myself with the press of a button. Oatchi\u2019s charge attack became my favorite of his abilities. \u201c Out of all of them, Oatchi\u2019s charge attack became my favorite of his abilities. Higher levels give him the ability to stun enemies for longer periods, while at the same time sending my entire horde of Pikmin onto a target to dispatch them quickly. This proved to be one of the best strategies for combat, and with the exception of bosses, it usually took down most enemies in one move \u2013 if I had enough or the right types of Pikmin along for the ride. That\u2019s the real trick to Pikmin 4\u2019s combat because the 110 unique enemies (including new elemental variants of returning creatures like Bulborbs and Dweevils) increase the need to adjust the composition of your army to counter them. For instance, if you try to battle a Fiery Bulblax with anything other than red Pikmin they\u2019ll ignite and run off screaming to their doom, meanwhile the Horned Cannon Beetle kept its backside weak point hidden unless I tossed one of the larger Purple, Ice, or Rock Pikmin into its blowhole above its head. Discovering my Otachi strategy early was great because it allowed me to spend less time replacing Pikmin lost in combat and more time collecting the 239 treasures across the six locations and 22 cave sub-levels I explored. Though once I fully leveled Oatchi\u2019s Rush ability, it never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. It never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. \u201c Some of those sub-levels place you inside machine structures with conveyor belts, a kid's room filled with structures made from wooden blocks, and a freezer filled with cold-emitting dry ice that will freeze most Pikmin in their tracks. Navigating these kinds of hazards never failed to put a smile on my face \u2013 though it\u2019s a different kind of smile than the one that creeps in when I hear the cries of my loyal Pikmin that I sometimes tossed to their certain doom in order to reach my objective. There are also some very cool Easter eggs that I won\u2019t spoil for you, other than to say you will definitely want to give a close look at the musical items. Most boss battles are saved for the lower floors of the various cave sub-levels, and while there are plenty of returning faces here we also encounter a fun handful of new ones, like the Sovereign Bulblax and the Foolix, the latter of which is a clever evolution on the Goolix from the very first Pikmin. At first he caught me off guard (making me look like a fool, appropriately) thanks to its clever disguise as a drop of nectar. Considering all the new types of enemies with elemental properties and the fact that Pikmin 4 only lets you bring out three types of Pikmin at a time, I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. Rock Pikmin are a staple of mine, as their hardy core both deals high damage when flung at bosses and prevents them from being crushed under the weight of larger enemies like the Yellow Wollywog, but I\u2019d often switch between ice, winged, and white Pikmin when I knew I\u2019d need to counter threats like the airborne Lesser Spotted Jellyfloat or the toxic-based Moldy Slooch. Between those and Oatchi\u2019s list of skills, the scales usually felt tipped in my favor. You can control Oatchi directly, but I found him more helpful as Pikmin 4\u2019s method of splitting up your party so you can tackle more objectives simultaneously. From the map screen you can give him commands to find treasures, lost team members, and specific Pikmin types while you take care of tasks on the other side of the map. This gave me more options in general: while exploring the Serene Shores level, I would send Oatchi and Blue Pikmin to locations only accessible to them. At the same time, I took an army of Yellow and Red Pikmin across the beach, defeating enemies and digging up buried treasure.  Getting the hang of this multitasking is a necessity to earn the best rewards in some of the later challenges. I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. \u201c This leads me to a minor gripe about how co-op works in Pikmin 4. Unlike Pikmin 2 or 3, where a second player could take control of another character and the two of you could split up to help reduce the time it took to find everything on a stage, Pikmin 4 instead has your co-op partner play as a reticle floating around the screen that can throw pebbles to move objects or hit enemies as your character does his usual thing. I would consider it more of an assist mode, like what we saw in Super Mario Galaxy, rather than an actual co-op mode. That\u2019s a bit of a letdown for anyone wanting to play through with a friend or significant other like we did in the previous games, but I imagine it will be great for allowing kids to help out a parent or older sibling \u2013 or vice versa. As for the two new Pikmin types, the first you\u2019ll encounter are ice Pikmin, and with them comes the ability to freeze bodies of water and enemies. They quickly became one of my favorites thanks to their freezing effect, which works in tandem with Oatchi\u2019s stun and allows you to chain status effects on enemies big and small \u2013 instead of spending time defeating enemies, you can just freeze them for long enough to get in and out. They are also key to destroying various ice barriers, and for navigating some of the caves with freezing temperatures that slow other Pikmin down, making them a solid option in most situations. Glow Pikmin are the other new additions, but they are only really available in the regularly occurring night missions. There, you\u2019ll trade in your real-time strategy-style gameplay for a simplistic tower defense format where you\u2019re challenged to protect various anthill-like structures until morning (or until all enemies have been defeated) using only Glow Pikmin. The lower difficulty stages started out basic and short but soon evolved into levels with multiple points to defend from hordes of enemies, often requiring me to leave Oatchi on defense while I explored on foot to figure out the optimal routes for protecting multiple points from waves of enemies. I didn\u2019t really care for these early on, but around the midway point of the campaign they added some new terrifying creatures and secondary points to defend, finally introducing the complexity and enemy variety I craved. As someone who seeks out challenge, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of one of the other additions: a set of overpowered single-use items. Alongside the standard ultra-spicy spray that temporarily boosts Pikmin performance and the bomb rocks that destroy concrete walls we get single-use items like Lightning Shock that can paralyze everything on the screen with electricity. Being able to toss bombs with homing or proximity effects kills all the tension in battles that otherwise have me frantically dashing around and flinging Pikmin to defeat enemies while keeping my little guys from being eaten or crushed. After testing them all out I felt like I had to artificially limit my use of them in most situations because they removed any need to be strategic. This, again, is great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin, and they will surely appreciate the assistance, but since Pikmin 4 doesn\u2019t offer any difficulty settings (like some of the previous games in the series have) they feel like too easy of a solution. Items are great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin. \u201c The one limitation on the power of these special items is that the raw materials you use to purchase them is also tied to building bridges to give you shortcuts through levels and permanent upgrades for yourself and Oatchi. Even without using many items, sometimes I would find myself without enough raw materials to build a bridge because I spent too many on upgrades, requiring me to circle back and gather more from deeper in the level to build them. Upgrades were my favorite use of raw materials because they include everything from boots that increase your movement speed to suits that grant elemental immunities and armor to increase your HP and Defense. While most upgrades aren\u2019t required to finish the story there are some locations, like an entrance to one of Pikmin 4\u2019s many sub-levels hidden in the center of a stove\u2019s burner, which require you to have an elemental immunity for both yourself and Oatchi just to get inside. Purchasing these sorts of upgrades early on made obstacles less of an issue as I scoured the levels for more raw materials and other items, and kept me excited for the next upgrade to become available.

While I can\u2019t go into detail, I will say that the post-credits content in Pikmin 4 might just be the best the Pikmin series has ever delivered. In fact, Pikmin 4\u2019s greatest folly is that it saves the best of its new tricks until you have completed the campaign\u2019s first ending and seen the credits, because I would\u2019ve liked to have dived right into all of these creative locations, met their bizarre inhabitants, and unlocked its homage to previous Pikmin games. Beyond the story and what comes after, Pikmin 4 offers a pair of modes designed to test your aptitude at the concept of Dandori: a Japanese word for the practice of organizing tasks strategically and working effectively to execute plans. In the Dandori Challenges you must gather all the treasures in a set location with a limited number of Pikmin, and the final couple of courses buck Pikmin\u2019s trend of being kid-friendly and are sure to test the best Pikmin players out there if they want to earn the coveted Platinum medal. Some of these took me more than a handful of attempts! And then there\u2019s the Dandori Battle mode, a chaotic mix of combat and gathering, and it\u2019s an enjoyable way to challenge my multitasking skill against an opponent who wants to win just as much as I do. You can play against the AI or a friend in local multiplayer, which is nice, but it\u2019s a shame there's no online capability."

        "Content": "Just like an actual ocean, Dave The Diver is beautiful at first glance, but then you dive into it to find a vast, wonderful world to explore just beneath the surface. This waterlogged adventure manages to exceed the expectations of an already hilarious premise with some of the most irresistible exploration, sim management, and minigames I\u2019ve seen in a long time, and which kept me completely glued to my seat for far more hours than I\u2019d ever intended. With characters and a story that are deceptively substantial and more content packed into it than I could have anticipated, Dave The Diver never stopped surprising me. If you would have told me that one of the best games I\u2019d play this year, standing alongside juggernauts with mega-million-dollar budgets, would end up being a retro indie RPG where you play as an obese SCUBA diver who runs a sushi shop\u2026I would have believed you, actually. That sounds awesome. And it is. Dave The Diver\u2019s story focuses on a loveable group of coworkers turned friends who open a sushi bar near the mysterious Blue Hole: a seemingly magical stretch of water known to change its terrain and aquatic ecosystem every day. You play as the titular Dave himself, a rotund, soda-chugging diver who begrudgingly caters to the whims of everyone in his life, including the occasional bossy sea creature. What follows is an endearingly silly tale involving a secret society of merfolk, some really aggressive wildlife-protection enthusiasts, and dozens of people making very rude comments about your character\u2019s weight. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask But while it comes off a bit shallow at first, the story shockingly develops into something more substantial, with characters that are far more complex than their pixelated faces initially suggest. Even after more than 30 hours I still find myself eager to spend time with the likes of Bancho, the stoic, fearless sushi chef, and Duff, the anime-obsessed, neck-bearded gunsmith. It certainly helps that many characters are given extremely amusing and memorable cutscenes every time you interact with them, like one where Bancho traumatizes a fish with his knife-sharpening skills or where Duff elegantly dives into a swimming pool to test out a newly crafted weapon. I\u2019ve seen them all dozens of times at this point, and yet I refuse to skip them \u2013 they\u2019re just that good. I refuse to skip cutscenes \u2013 they\u2019re just that good. \u201c But this is not just an amusing adventure RPG; it comes with a surprisingly deep restaurant-management sim baked into it. You\u2019ll split your time between diving into the dangerous depths of the Blue Hole to hunt for fish and supplies, battle wet foes, and complete quests while also managing a sushi shop by crafting recipes, cooking, hiring and training employees, and dealing with an extremely fussy clientele. Which game has the best fishing minigame? Moonglow Bay Sea of Thieves Red Dead Redemption 2 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Stardew Valley Dredge Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Diving into the Blue Hole is where the literal and figurative meat of the adventure happens: you\u2019ll use a harpoon, guns, and nets to capture and kill fish to be turned into sushi, and explore ever deeper, inevitably leading to action-packed confrontations with aggressive sharks, navigating ancient ruins filled with simple puzzles, and fighting off over-the-top bosses like a massive hermit crab using a monster truck as a shell. Tracking down and collecting all manner of sea life is a compelling and Zen-like game of hide and seek where you\u2019re rewarded for bringing your quarry down with as little brute force as possible by mastering Dave The Diver\u2019s simple but satisfying combat. Swimming around with guns blazing like a savage brute will get the job done quickly, but your shoddy work yields minimal usable resources for your restaurant. Using your harpoon \u2013 or better yet, nets or tranquilizer darts \u2013 to bring fish in alive is much more beneficial, but trickier. That tradeoff gives you plenty of ways to succeed, depending on your preference and what you think you can pull off with the tools you\u2019re given. Shoddy work yields minimal usable resources for your restaurant. \u201c Sometimes you\u2019ll get swarmed by a whole school of small, hungry biters, while other times a lone narwhal will come barreling at you to impale you on its spiral tusk; you never know what vicious wildlife lurks in the Blue Hole\u2019s depths. Dodging out of the way and fighting back is usually easy enough, so long as you aren\u2019t an overburdened sitting duck, but mastering the angles, navigating the environment, and choosing which weapon to bring with you (you only get one per dive) will significantly impact your options. You might prefer an awesome long-range sniper rifle that does high damage but has extremely limited ammo, or you might prefer to get up close and personal with your prey using a shotgun that requires less of that overrated aiming. Or, if you\u2019re feeling particularly brave, you might try to bring down your enemies with a tranquilizer dart gun and extract a giant shark to your boat while it snoozes for a few moments \u2013 a tall order that requires some serious finesse and can get you killed fast. There\u2019s lots of different ways to play, and although it always amounts to the same pattern of dodging, shooting, and swimming away from your pursuer, it allows for quite a bit of creativity and usually leads to some pretty amusing hijinks. Dave the Diver Screens 12 Images Fighting silly, enormous bosses and solving simple press-that-switch-to-open-the-path puzzles offers a nice change of pace from spearfishing, even if both are too easy to provide any kind of meaningful challenge (and no difficulty options are available to bump it up). There\u2019s definitely some very cool novelty in taking down a giant squid at the bottom of the ocean, but since nearly every boss can be killed (very quickly) by learning their pattern and hitting them three times, the break from the norm is usually short-lived. Similarly, while the plot developments that are usually involved in story-heavy puzzle sections are usually worth the trouble, the actual puzzles are mostly effortless busywork, like a few sections where you redirect beams of light off of mirrors but the solutions become obvious literally the moment you see them. It creates a loop that is truly hard to walk away from. \u201c In between dives you\u2019ll make worthwhile upgrades to your gear that make your excursions more profitable and improve your combat effectiveness. There are tons of useful stuff like making your oxygen tank bigger, refining your swimsuit so you can dive deeper, increasing your inventory space, and crafting and upgrading your weapons to deal more damage and apply status effects like poison and, nonsensically, fire to your underwater foes. All of these require increasing quantities of resources generated by capturing fish and driving up profits from your sushi business, and it creates a loop that is truly hard to walk away from. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I promised myself \u201cOne more dive,\u201d before then rationalizing to myself, \u201cWell, I gotta wrap up the day at the sushi stop, then I\u2019ll stop,\u201d then repeating those empty promises for hours on end. Throughout all of your exploration you\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on your oxygen tank, which smartly doubles as your life bar and your carry load limiter, drastically slowing you down when you bag too many fish and other treasures to easily carry back to the surface. Early on, that meant I often found quite a bit of challenge when faced with fish of prey, as one or two false moves could leave my oxygen nearly depleted as I desperately tried to get to the surface in time. Meanwhile, my greed for rare fish and supplies often forced my encumbrance beyond my maximum, leaving me sluggishly floundering around and jeopardizing my entire run \u2013 being spotted by a giant shark while over-encumbered is always a bit dicey.

This makes failure quite high-stakes \u2013 especially since you (annoyingly) can\u2019t save in the middle of runs, which could mean you lose a half hour of progress with a single death due to some rookie mistake you should have known better than to make. The limitations of your oxygen tank and carry load also ensure that you\u2019ll regularly need to emerge from your watery paradise, but that\u2019s not annoying at all because it leads to interactions with the other fantastic half of Dave The Diver\u2019s world: restaurant management. Like a true spreadsheet lover\u2019s dream, running an exotic sushi bar requires you to master numerous disciplines like gathering materials, hiring and training your staff, nurturing both an agricultural and a fish farm, learning recipes and upgrading your menu, and more. Watching sales charts climb and building a better business is a dopamine hit that kept me up late into the night and repeatedly drove me back into the ocean to collect ingredients, especially once the complexity of my business swelled to insane proportions when my success required me to open a branch location. The bonkers amount of depth and planning that goes into preparing for a single night of slinging sushi awoke my inner entrepreneur like few games have. Wait, should I open a sushi bar in real life? Oh, my God! Are we really doing this?! Dave The Diver nearly constantly keeps throwing new, ridiculous stuff at you. \u201c Perhaps Dave The Diver\u2019s best quality, though, is in how it nearly constantly keeps throwing new, ridiculous stuff at you. As if spearfishing and restaurant management weren\u2019t enough on their own, you\u2019ll also get into gambling, aquatic photography, seahorse racing, raising a Tamagatchi-inspired digital pet, concertgoing rhythm games, and at least 20 other absurd things I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil. Whether you\u2019re exploring the Blue Hole as you hunt for an elusive shark or hanging out with merpeople, Dave The Diver lives up to the adventure game genre by absolutely never being predictable throughout its entire duration. It\u2019s truly impressive that, even in the story\u2019s closing hours, I was still being introduced to new mechanics, some of which had caused the already habit-forming rabbit hole to grow ever deeper. There\u2019s even an entire section where you\u2019re suddenly thrown into a visual novel that fleshes out the backstories of some of the cast. Moments like that are just such a treat! The 10 Best Steam Deck Games 11 Images Not all of the gambles Dave The Diver takes are successful (if they were they wouldn\u2019t be gambles!) and sometimes you\u2019ll end up playing some haphazardly thrown-together minigame that feels like it could have been left on the cutting room floor. For example, in one part of the story you suddenly find yourself playing a half-baked 2D stealth game that has you hiding behind crates and lurking in freezers as you wait for braindead guards to slowly walk by. The good news is that these misses are extremely brief, and even when one didn\u2019t land with me, I was at least amused that the bizarre diversion was included at all. The last thing to note is that, despite a generally insane level of polish likely brought on by its tenure as an early access game, Dave The Diver does have some bugs it\u2019s yet to work out. Sometimes my UI would disappear, locking me out of doing things like managing my farm, and sometimes enemies or objects in the environment would become intangible, and a few times the framerate would randomly tank itself while I was hanging out in one particular area: the sea village. These issues weren\u2019t common enough to make me not want to keep playing this alarmingly compelling game, but they pretty significantly annoyed me when they happened \u2013 it definitely sucked, for example, when one boss randomly became invincible during our fight and I had to start the whole dive over.

Free League Publishing\u2019s The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying ( see it on Amazon ) builds on those connections while modifying the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition in clever ways that can be used to make an adventure that really feels like a tale from the iconic fantasy series. The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying converts the rules of The One Ring tabletop roleplaying game to 5E, a smart choice given how difficult it can be to convince D&D players to learn a new system. While the book is firmly anchored in the world of Middle-earth, packed with quotes from Tolkien\u2019s series along with sketches of its most famous places and characters, the rules are robust and novel enough that the book is worth a purchase for any game master interested in running a low-magic game for adults that places a greater emphasis on negotiation and exploration.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of The Ring, The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying is primarily focused on scrappy adventurers fighting against the encroaching power of the Shadow in the region of Eriador, which includes the Shire, Rivendell and Bree. While the cultures of elves, dwarves and men will feel familiar to D&D players \u2014 albeit given more Middle-earth specific flavor \u2014 D&D classes have been replaced with heroic callings like Messenger, which combines a bit of Rogue and Bard, and Champion, which has aspects of Fighter and Barbarian. Characters are capped at 10 levels to keep the power scale even more grounded, and none of the callings provide flashy magic. Wizards in Lord of the Rings are legendary figures, not a staple for every party. The closest players will come is a Scholar, who has a bit of healing and a stronger affinity for crafts, the game\u2019s name for novel abilities like talking to animals or reading runes. But crafts can also involve forging armor or singing songs to bolster your allies, making them just as viable an option for any character. They can be chosen as you level up in lieu of a virtue, The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying game\u2019s version of a feat. The classes feel well balanced, particularly when compared to the divides between the bounty of choices D&D spellcasters accumulate compared to the often rote actions of martial characters. Each calling also has a shadow path, representing the way a character may succumb to darkness. Rather than using D&D\u2019s simplistic alignment system, The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying encourages players to play flawed heroes like Boromir and Frodo who try to do the right thing but may succumb to doubt or greed. Committing misdeeds like stealing or lying, or even just encountering the dread creatures loyal to Sauron or a trove of treasure that belonged to a wicked dragon, can imbue a player with shadow points. The shadow path gives them both mechanical penalties and flaws to roleplay. A champion may become brutally violent and a captain overconfident in their own abilities. Gain enough shadow points and you may lash out at your own allies in a burst of madness or even become unplayable as your character is too burdened by the darkness they\u2019ve seen to go on. Luckily the influence of the shadow can be cleansed by being reminded of all that is good in the world through the game\u2019s fellowship phase. Meant to be a break in the faster pace of adventuring, fellowship takes some of the activities of D&D\u2019s downtime system, like crafting or gathering rumors, but adds on abilities that are particularly important to the world of Tolkien like writing songs or training an heir. These all have mechanical effects on the game. Writing your biography like Bilbo is a way to show your character growth and retrain abilities, while an heir will eventually receive some of your characters XP and gear \u2014 allowing for the telling of tales that fit well with Tolkien\u2019s multigenerational saga. Fellowship is also a time for players to gain information and other boons from their patron, which can be any powerful denizen of Middle-earth from Elrond to Gandalf. Lord of the Rings is filled with epic battles, but just as important are the long rides across hostile terrain or negotiations with potential powerful allies. The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying uses the combat rules from 5E, but adds new subsystems for councils and journeys to further emphasize those aspects of gameplay. Councils are formal social scenes where the party sets goals ahead of time and can earn XP and other rewards depending on how convincingly they can make their case through skill checks. It\u2019s a good opportunity for players who like talking to NPCs or making motivating speeches to shine by serving as the party\u2019s spokesperson. The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying uses the combat rules from 5E, but adds new subsystems for councils and journeys to further emphasize those aspects of gameplay. \u201c Journeys use a system similar to the ones found in Level Up Advanced 5th Edition and Pathfinder . The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying further emphasizes the challenges of navigating wild territories by dividing D&D\u2019s survival skill into hunting, explore and travel, and characters use their abilities to take on different roles in an expedition such as scout or hunter. The game master rolls on an encounter table, with the outcome shaped by how dangerous the territory is and the travel-focused abilities characters use. The journey may be marred with misfortune like stumbling upon the brutal handiwork of orcs or players may discover a lost wonder of Middle-earth and gain inspiration \u2014 the core D&D resources that allows players to roll with advantage and take the best result found on two d20s. The mechanics work well with the setting, where most characters have rarely ventured far from the safety of their homes and are often eager to be rid of the dangers of the road and find the comforts of a warm inn. Adding to the feel of heroes being pushed to their limits, short rests take eight hours rather than an hour and long rests can only be done somewhere safe. On the other hand, there are more mechanics that give players advantage and keep them from dying randomly due to a bit of bad luck, contributing to the themes of destiny found in Tolkien\u2019s work. Along with the core rulebook, Free League has also released Shire Adventures , which is meant as a sort of introduction to the system especially suited to new D&D or younger players . The Loremaster\u2019s Screen comes with a small booklet on Rivendell, which is a great place for the players to spend a fellowship phase and also includes new character options for elves. The game clearly has plenty of room to grow through new subcultures and exploration encounters and Free League has already announced the release of the Ruins of Eriador setting book and Tales From Eriador collection of adventures that will make The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying even easier to pick up and run.

There are sheets upon sheets of chits and standees to punch and organise into supplied storage trays and bags. There are decks and decks of cards which sit in slots, separated by dividers, in trays at the bottom of the box. There\u2019s a map board with stickers to mark your exploration, character sheets, tracking dials and lots of mysteriously sealed envelopes of secrets. Most intriguing of all is the row of symbol-marked sub-boxes within the main box. These are character boxes and they come in pairs with a matching symbol: one contains the character\u2019s miniature and the other their decks of cards, chits and character details. You get access to six of these, of varying complexity, at the start of the game and have to earn the right to open the remainder as you progress. Rules and How it Plays While that spiral-bound rulebook will look daunting for newcomers, veterans of either of the previous war board games will find most of the core systems intact. The most critical of these is its card-based approach to combat. Each player\u2019s character has a unique class and comes with its own deck of cards detailing the special powers, spells and combat moves it has access to. These are divided into two halves, with a different effect on each and a number in the middle. On your turn, you must pick two to play getting the upper effect from one, the lower effect from the other, and using either number as your initiative value for the turn. This makes planning your turn an absolute tactical minefield. The upper and lower effects are arranged in such a way that it\u2019s very hard, in most cases, to attack twice, or to chain your most powerful abilities together. In the rare instances where this is possible your initiative will almost certainly suffer. If Gloomhaven was big enough to exert its own gravity on the hobby as a whole, Frosthaven is even bigger \u201c Movement and melee against monsters on the tight corridors of the grid-based maps are taut and dangerous. On almost every turn you\u2019ll be torn between fighting enemies, helping friends or advancing your scenario goals. Trying to choose the right cards for the right circumstances is a pain so keen that it becomes a pleasure. All the more so when you lose cards for each cycle through the deck, a screw slowly tightening with every wasted action and another impossible decision point to face down. To make the cooperative aspect more interesting, players are only allowed to talk about their plans in general terms, not using specific numbers. Players also have random secret goals for each scenario, a longer-term quest which they can keep public or private as they wish. Players are also not supposed to share treasure, only keeping what they\u2019ve looted, crafted or bought themselves. All this conspires alongside the game\u2019s gnarly tactical engine to stop any one player from dominating the game and bossing others around. Everyone has their own objectives and will have to balance those with the needs of the group. Trying to prevent you from achieving either is the horde of monsters queuing down every corridor and behind each door to tear you apart. There are dozens of different types, each with its own simple AI deck to govern their behavior, including an initiative value for when they act. Most of them are ruthless and armed with a wide variety of special abilities like poison and paralysis to stack misery upon the misery of them ripping you to bits in combat. To stop combat from becoming predictable, Frosthaven uses combat modifier decks instead of dice so you get a mix of possibilities without any wild swings. Most of this is essentially the same as it was in Gloomhaven, bar a few clarifications and improvements to speed things along, plus plenty of all-new characters. And it\u2019s also much the same between scenarios. There are still events to draw on your way to a dungeon and events to draw afterwards, although they\u2019re now divided by season. You will still also get the chance to spend your gold on useful items and spend your experience on improving the ability and modifier decks for your character. You\u2019ll still find yourself on an absorbing, branching narrative of scenarios with somewhat more engaging writing. It\u2019s all still great, helping you feel part of a living world while offering an array of strategic options to play with. What\u2019s really new is the town of Frosthaven itself. Frosthaven, the town that is, has its own board and even its own character sheet. It serves as your base between adventures and you can use buildings there to do various things advantageous to your party. Early on, for example, you\u2019ll get the chance to craft items and potions from resources found on your quests. As time goes on you can use those same resources to add new buildings to the town and upgrade the ones you have, increasing your options and capabilities. You\u2019ll also be responsible for its defenses, which are called into play as part of frequent attack events which risk your hard-earned constructions being damaged or destroyed. What\u2019s really new is the town of Frosthaven itself. \u201c It\u2019s a fantastic addition. Not only does it give you more strategic options to play with and more motivation to dig through dungeons looking for loot but, because you created it, you become invested in it over time. In both Gloomhaven and Frosthaven, the characters you play will retire over time to be replaced by new ones. And while that adds variety and excitement to proceedings, it interferes with the bond between player and character that you want to foster in a role-playing-style board game . The town becomes a surrogate for that sense of attachment. It becomes your baby, something you want to work to improve and staunchly defend against harm. Of course, the town, like everything else in this massive game, requires a host of components to maintain. Playing the game entirely analogue, as written, with its overflowing inventory of chits, cards and characters is a colossal amount of overhead. Fortunately, there are various digital assistants you can employ instead which makes things easier. But no app can take the donkey work out of searching the box for the tiles you need to construct the map, or the monster standees to put on it. Nor can it help you remember what on earth is going on if you walk away for a fortnight and forget. Playing Frosthaven is a commitment in every sense, but if you\u2019re able to put in the regular hours it will reward you handsomely, and it even made our list of the best solo board games .

        "Content": "At first I was afraid, I was petrified \u2013 I kept thinking \"how could Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?\" But then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now we\u2019re back, in outer space\u2026 okay, okay, don\u2019t leave! I\u2019ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order\u2019s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this. Especially considering that there\u2019s no reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven\u2019t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired \u2013 there\u2019s no corny amnesia or other, \u201cOh no, my powers are gone!\u201d gimmick to make you re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as we left him five years prior. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch has been rocky, especially on the PC version, which Respawn has publicly apologized for and already begun to patch . Before you buy it, make sure to watch our in-depth Performance review. So we\u2019re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape. You\u2019re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that\u2019s just the beginning \u2013 the Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with your double-jump, things really take off \u2013 you can cover such crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was possible. It\u2019s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles. Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star Wars melee battles I\u2019ve ever seen. You don\u2019t even have to be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids \u2013 not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded \u2013 makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations. Lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. \u201c After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that answers the question of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if Han Solo were also a Jedi?\u201d The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy broadsword that\u2019s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor, while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in close. It\u2019s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning slash to cut them all down like blades of grass.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You can only equip two of the five stances at any given time, which at first seemed artificially limiting \u2013 and it is, when you think about it \u2013 but I came to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more personality as a fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own skill tree, so you\u2019re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no regrets. By the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorite stances, and no regrets. \u201c It\u2019s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate what\u2019s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That\u2019s very much in keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for a game like this, it seldom feels like there\u2019s a lot of time pressure to rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you\u2019re presented with by locals doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re neglecting a responsibility to save the galaxy. What We Said About Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order It\u2019s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. \u2013 Dan Stapleton, November 14, 2019 Score: 9 Read the full Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order review Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain unspoiled here, but they\u2019re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away. In any case, at least they\u2019re written and acted with enough depth that they don\u2019t feel like retreads of anyone Cal\u2019s faced before, and neither is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There\u2019s more to them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot for the most part. The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force. \u201c The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan\u2019s Cal is not so easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about more than simply fighting the Empire now: it\u2019s about whether he can live a life where he\u2019s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of his guilt, and find a home that\u2019s safe. His path after escaping Order 66 is contrasted against what could\u2019ve been if he\u2019d had different priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much more realized protagonist this time around. Every IGN Star Wars Game Review 113 Images Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal\u2019s side, but the rest of the crew are all given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and why they\u2019re coming back together now. Greez\u2019s loveable cantankerousness made him a favorite, and he\u2019s happy to deliver more of that along with some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his \u201cgrab some seat\u201d catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she\u2019s less of a constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. Cere's power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. \u201c Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of the group is Bode. He\u2019s another roguish mercenary type who, much like Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the two bro it up to establish the friendship they\u2019ve struck up fighting the Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however, he does become a more interesting companion. Dan's favorite Star Wars games I've been playing Star Wars games since the late 80s - here are my picks. See All Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Aspyr Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Obsidian Entertainment Star Wars: TIE Fighter LucasArts Star Wars: Empire at War Petroglyph Star Wars Battlefront II [2005] Pandemic Studios Star Wars: Dark Forces LucasArts Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Vicarious Visions Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Respawn Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Respawn Star Wars: The Force Unleashed -- Ultimate Sith Edition LucasArts Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor\u2019s single most thrilling action sequence). They can\u2019t be killed or downed in action so there\u2019s no management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy while you thin out his friends\u2019 ranks. Beyond that, they\u2019re only really used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1\u2019s adorable bleeps and bwoops couldn\u2019t do alone. Survivor takes advantage of that fact that it takes place at the midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. \u201c Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial Inquisitors it\u2019s a relief to see that the Empire\u2019s role here is more in the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are mostly here to provide variety after you\u2019ve been fighting the main enemy army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It\u2019s a clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy enemies together into the same game \u2013 one that takes advantage of the fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. There\u2019s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen Order \u2013 no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It\u2019s a good mix of enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order\u2019s already respectable lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I\u2019d temporarily Force-confused to my side) it\u2019s a great time. On the subject of creatures, one of Cal\u2019s many new abilities is to tame non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn\u2019t ever used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than Cal could\u2019ve run on foot. Given that running doesn\u2019t drain his stamina, it seems that it\u2019s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There\u2019s also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very specific points, so it\u2019s not much of a game-changer either, but it does play nicely into environmental puzzles. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor. \u201c Speaking of environments, this journey takes us to a handful of never-before-seen planets, some of which are expansive and include a variety of extremely different areas within them. Koboh, for instance, has everything from grasslands to swamp to underground facilities, a massive crashed Separatist ship, and even its own version of Cloud City. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor that are either 100 percent desert or completely covered in redwoods, respectively. Every time I entered a new area I\u2019d circle the camera, looking for the telltale signs the level designers leave to indicate a wall is runnable, a ceiling can be clung to, a crack can be squeezed through, and more. By the time I was done with my 30-hour run through the story I had trouble even remembering to use all of the abilities I had learned because there are simply so many. Levels are meticulously thought-out puzzles in and of themselves, and only rarely did I run across something that didn\u2019t feel intuitive or fair once I took into account all the tools at my disposal. The Enemies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor 11 Images Considering that this adventure is roughly equal parts combat and puzzle-solving, the fact that there\u2019s such a broad selection of types works in its favor. Puzzles that deal with directing energy beams and even painting paths are clever and well done, on par (and sharing some ideas) with a lot of what we saw in God of War Ragnarok last year. Some involve using BD-1 to launch projectiles to trigger remote switches, some have rolling homing bombs, and some use deployable balloons you can grapple to and launch off of. A few of the main storyline puzzles gave me cause to scratch my head for a few minutes before the solution sprung to mind, which is just about the right level of challenge. They aren\u2019t groundbreaking in their design, but consistently fun nonetheless. Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game. \u201c Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game with beautifully detailed environments and characters\u2026 and perhaps as a result, not one of the best performing. My PS5 playthrough saw some fairly gnarly slowdowns from the expected 30 frames per second in 4K Quality Mode, especially when fighting around smoke or fog, which made timing by parries and dodges difficult. Disappointingly, even the 1440p Performance Mode isn\u2019t close to holding a locked 60fps. I also saw a few crashes and bugs that forced me to quit and reload my save to progress (though this was before the day one patch). EA has naturally promised more patches will come with improvements on all platforms, but if history is any guide it might take a little while before it\u2019s completely ironed out. A smooth frame rate is certainly important when battling Survivor\u2019s multiple lightsaber-wielding bosses, because there\u2019s no shortage of challenge in learning the timing of parrying their strikes and dodging their unblockable attacks. I must confess: after several hours of banging my head against the brutal final boss I finally resorted to turning the difficulty down a notch to see the ending in time for this review, which hurt my pride because I\u2019d made it to his final phase but couldn\u2019t quite get over the finish line. That said, there\u2019s not a lot that felt especially novel about these fights; they\u2019re well made, but conventional and one aspect that hasn\u2019t seen a great improvement from Fallen Order. One smart tweak that does stand out, however, is that when a boss kills you, the next time you come at him he\u2019s not glowing yellow signifying you\u2019ll get your health back the first time you hit him like a normal enemy does. Instead, there\u2019s a glowing pillar of light where you fell, and picking that up heals you. That allows you to save the full-health pick-up for when you need it rather than just as the fight begins \u2013 it\u2019s a smart and welcome evolution of Fallen Order\u2019s already ingenious system of tipping the scales in your favor when you need it. I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack. \u201c When it comes to tracking those bosses down in the first place, I certainly appreciate that the Jedi games give you a map (unlike other games of this style that I could name that delight in making you figure it out) but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to usability. Just like in Fallen Order, this map seems so dedicated to the idea of resembling a light-blue Star Wars hologram that it\u2019s not always easy to figure out what you\u2019re looking at and the directions its waypoints give you aren\u2019t always accurate. However, its dotted lines were generally good enough to point me in the right direction when I struggled to find a path forward or was feeling lost, or redirect me when I was trying to figure out a way past an obstacle I didn\u2019t have the right gear for yet. Also, this time Respawn has granted us the ability to fast-travel between save points, which feels like an act of mercy when the objective is on the other side of one of these large, labyrinthian maps. These maps are dense, too, and Survivor is packed full of stuff to do around the edges of the main story, including bounty hunters and legendary creatures to track down and kill, combat challenges, and more. Some of them are seriously tough, even on the default Jedi Knight difficulty level; I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack, other than that it was literally dozens. But I got him in the end! You\u2019ll also unlock a full New Game+ mode once you beat the story, which is a welcome feature that Fallen Order didn\u2019t have until more than six months after launch. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images On top of all of that, there\u2019s an intimidating amount of stuff to collect, including plants and fish which can then be displayed in the cantina in your base town on Koboh. But while there might be some unlocks at the end of those sidequests, it doesn\u2019t do much to convince you that these are activities you should spend a lot of time on\u2026 unless you really like plopping down seeds on rooftop gardens or watching a virtual aquarium. Of course some rewards are much more enticing to a Star Wars fan. Cal\u2019s lightsaber and blaster both have many customizable cosmetic parts that you can mix and match to form your own creation, and even though you can barely make out those details when you\u2019re using it in a fight unless you zoom in with the photo mode, it\u2019s a fantastic, loving bit of Star Wars detail to obsessively mess with whenever you find a new piece. Plus, all of the available lightsaber blade colors are unlocked shortly after the start so that you can make Cal more your own from the very beginning. That also goes for his range of clothing options, which is far more extensive this time around, as well as his entirely new haircut and beard options. He\u2019ll always be the same Cal Kestis underneath it, but your soul-patch and mullet-wearing character will have a very different vibe from mine, whose crew cut and beard resembles a redheaded version of Amos Burton from The Expanse. Yes, it\u2019s a little silly to find hair and beard options in treasure chests, but sure, why not? Similarly, I\u2019m just delighted at the customization for BD-1. In the first game, you could only change his paint job, but his enduring popularity (which led to his Mandalorian cameo) has paid dividends because now we get many more options for components on his face, head, \u201cears,\u201d body, and legs, as well as detailed color options and even the level of wear and tear. Just wait until you see the way his body reacts to having pieces swapped out in the customization menu! It\u2019s another lovely little touch in a game that presents so many.

In that time, we\u2019ve gotten some respectable LEGO Potter games , an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is Harry Potter Kinect . But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I\u2019m happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that\u2019s stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy\u2019s issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World. Right in line with most Harry Potter tales before it, Legacy\u2019s plot has more holes than a fishnet stocking and sorta just expects you to accept that its magical world makes no sense. This mystical third-person action-adventure RPG begins with you transferring to Hogwarts as a fifth-year witch or wizard (for unexplained reasons) to do everything from attending classes to fighting giant spiders with a magical stick to flying around on a hippogriff. The fantastic character creator has plenty of options for you to craft your ideal witch or wizard (apart from a fairly limited voice selection), and as soon as you do they\u2019ll immediately become entangled in a conflict between the Wizarding World and an evil goblin. On top of that, because being in a secret society of wizards is apparently not exciting enough, you soon discover that you\u2019ve got some freaky super-charged magical abilities that allow you to do extra cool stuff that also isn\u2019t really explained.

But once that\u2019s over with Legacy mostly redeems itself with a fantastic cast of non-painting characters that help boil things down into a not-too-convoluted good-guys-versus-bad-guys conflict that ends up being an enjoyable tale, even if it's not particularly profound or original.

Most are memorable and instantly endearing, like Sebastian the cocky and morally pliable Slytherin, or Natsai the clever and unflappable Gryffindor, and spending time with them and improving your social links through their relationship questlines made my stay at Hogwarts all the more enjoyable. Concerning J.K. Rowling The elephant in the room with Hogwarts Legacy is Harry Potter\u2019s creator, J.K. Rowling, whose comments about transgender people in recent years have left a sour taste in the mouths of many current and former Potter fans , both at IGN and in the world at large. This has driven some to call for a boycott of the Wizarding World altogether \u2013 including Hogwarts Legacy, though Rowling was not directly involved and there are good reasons (both in-game and out ) to believe the developers at Avalanche don\u2019t necessarily share her views. Regardless, IGN has always and will continue to champion human rights causes and support people speaking with their wallets in whatever manner they choose. As critics, our job is to answer the question of whether or not we find Hogwarts Legacy to be fun to play and why; whether it\u2019s ethical to play is a separate but still very important question. So just as in virtually all cases, we\u2019re choosing to expose and address the views of the franchise creator separately from our consideration of the work of the hundreds of game developers and evaluate Hogwarts Legacy as it stands, leaving behind-the-scenes context to be considered in addition to that evaluation, rather than in place of it, so that it can be weighted according to your own values. Unexpectedly, I even found myself looking forward to hanging out with my professors, whether it was my main man Professor Fig, who serves as both something of a mentor and as a sidekick, or the wise-cracking charms teacher Professor Ronen, who made me love him mostly by making fun of me. Each of these characters feels like an indispensable piece of the school, and you can find them wandering the halls doing their thing and choose to spend time with your favorites. It\u2019s a huge and important part of the Hogwarts fantasy that Legacy just knocks out of the park. The world is packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game. \u201c Even better, though, is the world itself, which is just packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game and more. You\u2019ll find yourself exploring Hogwarts\u2019 stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, flying around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, and exploring dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. The developers at Avalanche have so brilliantly captured the look and feel of the Wizarding World that I was amazed at just being there, no matter what trivial errand they had me wrapped up in. Which universe could use a new, big-budget video game? Star Trek John Wick Terminator Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Fast & The Furious Other - Tell us in the comments Answer See Results That immersion can occasionally be broken by Legacy\u2019s dicey performance, though, which suffered from just about every issue that makes IGN\u2019s performance review team cry during my time playing on PlayStation 5. Those greatest hits include framerate inconsistency, weird issues where the lighting switches from too dark to too bright, aggressive pop-in while moving around the map quickly, and more. There\u2019s even this weird thing where every door in Hogwarts has a brief loading screen. It\u2019s understandable since there\u2019s so much packed into this beast of an adventure, but the PS5\u2019s promises of the death of loading screens haven\u2019t quite been lived up to here as it\u2019s clearly struggling to keep up with the spellcraft and whimsy of the Wizarding World. Beyond the performance issues, Legacy is also a fairly glitchy adventure in general. You\u2019ll probably fall through the map a time or two, or see a character or object get caught in the environment, or maybe even have the person you\u2019re talking to just up and walk away from you in the middle of a conversation, leaving you to speak with the empty spot they were standing in for about two minutes. I didn\u2019t encounter anything game-breaking or so common that you\u2019ll likely want to curse its name, but things like this do happen enough to be an irritation. Combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. \u201c As someone who finds the wand-whipping combat in the movies fairly dull, I was very concerned about Hogwart Legacy\u2019s ability to keep my attention after slinging spells for dozens of hours, but I can admit when I\u2019m wrong \u2013 the combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. There\u2019s a lot more to it than shooting balls of light out of a stick! Instead, the trick is in dodging and countering enemy attacks while pulling off creative combos. For example, you can pull enemies towards you with Accio, light them on fire with the close-range Incendio, then blow them away with the explosive Bombarda spell. Chaining together abilities to make your opponents look like complete fools never stops being amusing, especially as you unlock talent tree perks that enhance your skills with modifiers that make your elemental spells fork to nearby enemies or transform into AoE attacks. Many of the combat encounters are legitimately challenging too \u2013 I\u2019ll admit I died my fair share of times while trying to show off a new set of spells or neglecting to see the goblin sneaking up behind me. Improving your skills and figuring out which spells work best for you is a really entertaining process, filled with experimentation and the occasional maiming. There\u2019s even a perfect parry mechanic, which begs to be mastered by tryhards like me looking for that extra dopamine hit that comes from a timely block at the last possible second. You\u2019ll also be forced to change up your tactics regularly, since many enemies have color-coded shields that can only be broken by spells of a particular type. For example, enemies with a red shield won\u2019t be damaged until you hit them with a fire-based spell, which means you\u2019ll need to keep a few of those handy. Shielded enemies regularly force you to change your tactics. \u201c While the combat system never stops being entertaining, the creatures you fight soon run out of tricks up their sleeves. You\u2019ll see the same familiar faces a lot, as you spend an enormous amount of your time fighting dark wizards, spiders, and goblins. Every once in a while they\u2019ll trot out the same repeated troll enemy or nondescript magical suit of armor as well, but the enemies Legacy throws at you wear thin pretty quick. That\u2019s a shame, since the Harry Potter universe is known for having all manner of beasts and villains to face off against, and yet here there\u2019s practically no variety. What\u2019s especially weird is that it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t other enemy types to be found in Legacy \u2013 you\u2019ll find giant, evil frogs and zombies roaming about, to name a few \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re scarcely used in any of the main dungeons or levels. Instead, they send about 500 spiders at you in a row, which is a baffling decision.

You learn quite a number of spells by the end of the roughly 30+ hour campaign and constantly have to reslot which ones you\u2019ve got equipped; keeping them organized and committed to memory becomes a challenge in its own right, and not the kind I relish. When you\u2019re not lighting spiders on fire, you\u2019ll need some lighter activities to spend your time with, and it\u2019s actually kind of crazy just how many side tasks Legacy gives you! You could spend hours decorating your very own personal space in the Room of Requirement; go around catching, grooming, and breeding all manner of fantastic beasts (if you know where to find them); practice your gardening or potion making; go shopping in Hogsmeade; become a champion duelist in an underground dueling ring with your classmates; or even go full Voldemort and decide you want to become a master of the Dark Arts by learning the Killing Curse and other unspeakable acts (which goes about as well as you\u2019d expect if you choose to pursue it). It\u2019s not just easy to waste dozens of hours goofing off \u2013 I found it downright difficult to not get distracted by a dozen things and forget what I\u2019d originally set out to do. I was able to get through the main story in 32 hours, but even though I was in something of a hurry to complete it I found staying on task almost impossible. As soon as I finished I immediately went back to do more side quests and continue exploring (which you can do freely after finishing, since there doesn\u2019t appear to be a New Game+ mode currently). I was able to get through the main story in 32 hours. \u201c I will say though, with the wizarding buffet of endless ways to waste your time, it\u2019s a pretty glaring omission that Quidditch is nowhere to be found. The lore reason for a lack of the iconic broom-based sport is that it\u2019s been banned for one year thanks to some pureblood wimp who got injured last year, but that feels like an effort to paper over the absence of a major aspect of Harry Potter\u2019s time at Hogwarts that the developers must\u2019ve just not had time to include. Hogwarts Legacy Screenshots 10 Images One of the ways you can completely forget about the looming goblin threat in the main story is by engaging in the over 100 side quests that are packed into the adventure. Not all of these diversions are equally entertaining \u2013 some are definitely your basic \u201cgo here and kill/collect this thing\u201d errands that do little more than burn some time \u2013 but many feature one of the aforementioned awesome characters asking for you to solve their problems or help them get into good ol\u2019 fashioned mischief. Those are especially great reasons to slow down and immerse yourself in this world, like when you go to class to learn how to pot plants that try to eat you or help a classmate who\u2019s getting picked on. Legacy just gives you lots of reasons to drink in the experience of being a student at Hogwarts, and the novelty of that doesn\u2019t wear off even when you\u2019ve been sent on some meaningless fetch quest. Legacy gives you lots of reasons to drink in the experience of being a student at Hogwarts. \u201c It also helps that you\u2019re often appropriately rewarded for your efforts, whether that\u2019s earning some gear to upgrade your stats, cosmetic items to improve your swagger, or best of all: new spells, the ultimate carrot in a game where you're often limited only by what magic you know how to cast. For example, one sidequest gives you the Alohomora spell, which \u2013 in classic Metroidvania fashion \u2013 allows you to literally unlock doors and get into places previously inaccessible to you. Collecting spells goes a long way to opening up the map and giving you a better bag of tricks during combat, and I found myself positively thirsting for as many of these game-changing abilities as I could get my grubby paws on. The 25 Best Harry Potter Characters 26 Images The gear that you\u2019ll find doesn\u2019t really allow you to create full-on \u201cbuilds\u201d per say, but you\u2019ll gain some resistances and buffs to your character and can spend some time upgrading and modifying your best items for minor improvements. None of it is particularly game-changing stuff, but it managed to capture my attention enough for me to spend a good chunk of time looking at my equipment. Of course, the real loot game is about the cosmetics, a fact that Legacy seems to be keenly aware of since they find ways to hide cool-looking clothes all over the place. These items don\u2019t have any gameplay impact, but pimping out my Slytherin legend to outshine all the kids from the lesser houses is more than enough of a motivation. Best of all, you can overwrite the appearance of any gear you\u2019ve got equipped with the look of anything you\u2019ve acquired so far, which is just fantastic. However, if you\u2019re as much of a loot hoarder as I am and were hoping to gather up all the treasures in the world and dump them in a closet like in Skyrim you\u2019ll be painfully disappointed by Legacy\u2019s abysmal inventory space, which only lets you hold a couple dozen items and aggravatingly fills up in no time at all. This means you\u2019ll miss out on tons of items early on unless you go to your menu and decide which precious treasure to throw overboard every time you open a chest. Later on you can upgrade your inventory ever so slightly, but even then it never stops being a major pain in the cockatrice to juggle your inventory all the time.

        "Content": "When a game hits on a good idea, some developers are content to play it safe for the sequel, making a few refinements but largely stick to what worked the first time. That totally makes sense. But Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is not that kind of sequel; even though Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle surprised us all with its smart XCOM -style tactics in Nintendo clothing, this followup maintains its best ideas but reinvents itself to the point where it immediately feels very different. It\u2019s bigger and better in nearly every way, with a more freeform and customizable take on combat and an almost completely rethought overworld that\u2019s much less linear and absolutely packed with puzzles. The story\u2019s all over the place and the Switch can\u2019t always handle everything smoothly, but it\u2019s a fantastic game that can be played as either an enjoyable cakewalk or a deep, demanding tactical challenge, all while maintaining its zany sense of humor. Picking back up in the post-Rabbid invasion Mushroom Kingdom, things immediately get even weirder when a giant manta ray from space arrives to cause trouble. The story is actually one of Sparks of Hope\u2019s few missteps: the original\u2019s trans-dimensional blending of Mario characters and goofball Rabbids is completely absurd, but it kind of makes sense in its own way. This time, though, the completely unrelated enemy spreads what\u2019s effectively Ganon\u2019s corrupt ooze with eyeballs from Breath of the Wild everywhere, and most but not all of her minions are also Rabbids for some reason? Also we have a spaceship for traveling between literal worlds? It makes Kingdom Battle look grounded in reality by comparison, which is something I never thought I\u2019d say about that game. I wasn\u2019t expecting deep lore or anything, but it\u2019s kind of a mess. It does consistently have some pretty good jokes, though, so at least I was chuckling as I was scratching my head. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That weirdness is more than made up for by the fact that all nine characters on your team are absolutely dripping with personality \u2013 none more than Rabbid Peach. With her satirical Gen Z social media diva persona and jaunty walk in the overworld, she stands out among the crew even though they all have their own entertaining quirks. Luigi has his traditional awkward leaning run, Rabbid Rosalina is determinedly lethargic, and Bowser is as much of a hulking bulldozer as you\u2019d expect. They\u2019re just fun to watch, and I\u2019m still noticing new and amusing subtleties to their animations. It can go too far at times, such as how an animation plays every time you activate a character\u2019s signature ability, but mercifully you can turn that off when you get tired of it. They\u2019re just fun to watch, and I\u2019m still noticing new and amusing subtleties. \u201c Battles themselves feel different right away. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still a grid underneath the maps somewhere, but Sparks of Hope does a fantastic job of hiding it and making movement in tactical battles look and feel smooth as Mario and friends run around. You\u2019re still confined to a radius based on each character\u2019s movement stats, but there are plenty of ways to chain actions together to extend it \u2013 most notably the team jump, where one character can bounce off of another to cross the usually small maps in one turn. That move now adds a clever touch of real-time movement to this turn-based game: heroes will hover for a few seconds, during which you have to steer them. Wasting precious time here can be the difference between landing safely or falling off a cliff and taking damage, so you have to be careful about where you plan to land. There\u2019s also an extremely handy line that shows you the movement range of your other characters, which is invaluable for figuring out where to position them for jumps as you switch between teammates. What's Mario's best job? Plumber Doctor Kart racer Golfer Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results The big new idea, though, is the Sparks. As you play you unlock dozens of these cute little guys with names like Pyrogeddon and Toxiquake; when equipped they grant abilities from straightforward elementally charged shots, dashes, and area-of-effect weapons (they also come with passive resistances to those elements) to more interesting abilities like attracting or repelling enemies, resurrecting fallen teammates, and invisibility. Being able to mix and match two Sparks onto each hero opens up all kinds of opportunities, such as equipping Rabbid Luigi\u2019s ricochetting frisbee weapon with a freeze effect to immobilize a long chain of enemies, or giving Bowser a reflection ability that bounces enemy attacks back at them after he absorbs a bunch of hits. Being able to mix and match two Sparks onto each hero opens up all kinds of opportunities. \u201c A lot of Sparks are similar to the special effects of Kingdom Battle\u2019s weapons, but with one important difference: those usually only have a ~30% chance of occurring when you hit an enemy, which means you can\u2019t really plan on a target catching fire or being stuck in place. Here, if you spend one of a character\u2019s two action points to activate a Spark ability, such as an electric shot, it\u2019s guaranteed to shock a target if it hits them. There\u2019s still a fair amount of dice rolling, in that enemies in half cover only have a 50% chance of being hit (and of course there\u2019s always a possibility of a critical hit,) but I feel much more in control of the outcome of a move than I did in the original. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope Extended Presentation Screenshots 10 Images Wringing out every bit of potential from each of your three characters every turn takes practice and an understanding of Sparks of Hope\u2019s rules. There are dash attacks, team jumps, Spark powers, and good old-fashioned weapon attacks, and every character works a little differently \u2013 especially after a few upgrades. Luigi, for instance, is the only hero who can do two team jumps in one turn, and he can unlock an ability to earn an additional dash attack with each one. Rabbid Peach, meanwhile, can heal her teammates when she lands. None of these character-specific abilities are required outside of a handful of missions where your squad is chosen for you, so you have enormous freedom to experiment and discover who you like best. You don\u2019t have to take Mario into combat at all this time if you don\u2019t want to, but his uncharacteristically badass dual pistols are fantastic for spreading hurt to multiple targets, and his ability to bounce off of enemies\u2019 heads is a fun nod to his goomba-stomping roots. And don\u2019t worry: he\u2019s voiced by Charles Martinet, not Chris Pratt. Every character works a little differently \u2013 especially after a few upgrades. \u201c The normal difficulty is usually pretty forgiving \u2013 in a lot of cases I could literally hand my controller to my seven-year-old son and he would come out on top, though there were a few battles I had to try more than once. But there are a ton of difficulty options (including the ability to turn off damage altogether) and I found that turning up the main one brought the challenge to a satisfying place where I had to be careful about my moves or risk getting thumped. Of course, there\u2019s not a lot of consequence to losing a fight because you can simply try again, and you\u2019re not even scored on your performance like in Kingdom Battle, so it doesn\u2019t matter if one or two of your team goes down. But you do have persistent health, so you have to worry about starting your next battle injured if you take too much of a beating. What We Said About Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle Based on its colorful world, beautiful animation, and source material you might expect Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle to be \u201cMy first turn-based tactics game.\u201d But you\u2019re in for a surprise: even for XCOM vets some of its battles are challenging puzzles. Some of its tougher levels do devolve into a trial-and-error slog, but a good mix of enemies, objectives, and character abilities keep things interesting. \u2013 Dan Stapleton, August 28, 2017 Score: 7.7 Read the full Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle review  You can heal up your team at the start of a battle by paying coins you earn in combat and collect all over the overworld, but those are also useful for buying consumable items like healing mushrooms, movement range extenders, and ability cooldown resets (among others). Some of these can feel a bit like cheating \u2013 I\u2019ve beaten some battles within the first turn thanks to boosting Luigi\u2019s movement to let him reach the goal zone before the enemy even gets a chance to move \u2013 but usually they provide a much-needed shot in the arm when you have to turn the tide of a battle. Enemy variety is a strong point: even though there\u2019s a fair amount of tweaked and reused models (like the big brutish guys with different animals strapped to their arms) they have pretty much all of the same powers you do, from fireballs to health stealing and knockback, so you often have to adapt your strategy to counter them. Boss fights against the evil Spark Hunters aren\u2019t quite as over-the-top and zany as in Kingdom Battle and their accompanying music never reaches the same carnivalish heights, but they\u2019re consistently a good time. That's driven in large part by interesting map designs that make good use of things like warp pipes, jump pads, and destructible cover to keep both you and the enemy mobile and ensure battles don't bog down into long-range shootouts. Most are over in less than 10 minutes, which keeps the pace moving along nicely. The fact that there\u2019s a loading screen just to enter and exit the menu is a bridge too far. \u201c What gnaws at me, though, is all the loading screens. It\u2019s expected that there\u2019d be a brief pause when moving between worlds or entering a new area, or when starting a battle and returning to the overworld, but the fact that there\u2019s a loading screen just to enter and exit the menu is a bridge too far. You have to jump in and out of menus a lot because nearly every battle will put you up against enemies with different vulnerabilities and resistances, so in order to exploit their weaknesses you\u2019ll want to shuffle your team and their Sparks around. It\u2019s only a few seconds every time, sure, but it adds up \u2013 especially if you come back to the battle and realize you\u2019ve forgotten something and need to go back to tweak it. Other than that, Sparks of Hope performs well enough, though some of the bright and colorful worlds do cause the poor Switch to chug a bit in places.

Also, movement feels much better than it does in Kingdom Battle because of the simple fact that Beep-O (the Roomba-like robot that guides your team) now hovers above your lead character\u2019s head instead of leading the party himself, which makes navigating much easier. There\u2019s a boatload of content here \u2013 I spent more than 30 hours on my playthrough and didn\u2019t come close to completing every puzzle, side mission, and secret zone to unlock every Spark. The puzzles do make me less enthusiastic about the idea of replaying the campaign, though, since the idea of solving them again doesn\u2019t sound nearly as entertaining as it was the first time, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been left unsatisfied by my first time through, and there are plenty of opportunities for fights against bad guys roaming the overworld if you want to keep playing after you\u2019ve completed the story."

It feels like it\u2019s not only fulfilled the potential of its \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\u201d survival premise, but exceeded nearly all of my expectations of it. Even though it\u2019s still plagued with mostly harmless bugs (the software kind) that can annoy, I enjoyed practically every minute of the over 100 hours I\u2019ve played so far of this stunningly creative and consistently funny adventure, and it easily stands shoulder to shoulder alongside some of my favorite survival games. Grounded is a survival game first and foremost, but draws a ton of inspiration from Obsidian\u2019s history as a team of RPG wizards as well. You\u2019ll split your time between scavenging the charming backyard setting for materials, crafting awesome items from the corpses of your enemies, building badass structures to protect yourself and your stuff, fighting giant bugs that gave my co-op partners nightmares, exploring extremely difficult dungeons, leveling up your character\u2019s stats and equipment, and more. Numerous character progression mechanics, an enemy weaknesses and resistances system that had me poring over data in the menu, the elaborate boss fights, and NPCs and dialogue options that break up the action all make it feel more like a roleplaying game than most of its survival peers. Admittedly, there aren\u2019t very many NPCs to find and most story development is either told via collectible audio recordings or locked behind hours of survival gameplay and a bit of grinding, but Grounded strikes a great balance between making you feel on your own in a hostile backyard and meeting quirky characters, most of whom inevitably try to maim you.

One of your main allies is a fiercely annoying, spatula-handed robot who\u2019s programmed to cook burgers; the bad guy\u2019s name is Director Shmector; and you spend a lot of time running around collecting a currency called Raw Science \u2013 Grounded just never takes itself seriously, to hilarious effect. In fact, one endgame reveal was so over-the-top and wonderfully stupid that it caused both of my teammates to remove their headsets for a few minutes to \u201cwalk it off\u201d as I howled with delight.

The star of Grounded is hands-down the backyard itself. \u201c Even with memorable characters, though, the star of Grounded is hands-down the backyard itself, which is completely beautiful and oozes personality from every blade of grass. One inhospitable and extremely rude area of the yard has an overturned charcoal grill that acts as a volcanic mountain range, while another has a leaking bug bomb that fills the area with a noxious gas and mutated insects. A child\u2019s sandbox becomes a hysterical, hostile desert where staying out in the sun for more than a few seconds causes you to burn up, so you\u2019ve gotta dart between patches of shade for cover. A koi pond becomes a terrifying and deadly game of cat and mouse as you explore the water\u2019s depths and avoid the oppressive gaze of the pond\u2019s gilled master. Every tiny patch of grass acts as its own distinct area, with its own host of increasingly dangerous creatures, things to discover, and obstacles to overcome, and the attention to detail and creativity born from that never stopped making me smile \u2013 even small things, like how you have to collect drinkable water from blades of grass that carry a single drop of dew, are excellent little touches.

In the over 100 hours I\u2019ve sunk into it so far I never came even close to running out of things to do, and although I now feel like I know the yard like the back of my hand, it\u2019s still overwhelming just how big the place feels. I feel like I\u2019ve still yet to scratch the surface in a lot of ways. Part of what makes Grounded so immensely addictive is the fact that it gets so many things right with its sandbox, from building and resource management to exploration and combat. What starts out as a pretty straightforward set of building blocks with base building quickly proliferates into downright insanity that goads you into unleashing your creativity with multi-story buildings, ziplines, trampolines, and housing for your pets. This alone can soak up hours of your time as you work to perfect your tiny dwelling with all the modern accommodations a miniature child might want, like a cooking station for making delicious insect-based foods, a comfy leaf bed for a night\u2019s rest, or a garden for growing your own mushrooms and the like. In my group\u2019s case, we built our home into the side of a massive oak tree, and over the course of our playthrough our structure steadily climbed up the twisted roots and branches until it felt like a proper fortress. Placing items and getting the spacing just right isn\u2019t always perfect and sometimes the finicky controls for placing structures can result in wasted time or resources, but it\u2019s flexible enough so that you can build around most environments or else tear off what\u2019s there to make it your own.

This part of Grounded feels much more like a proper RPG adventure than a standard survival game, with melee and ranged combat mechanics that often require precise timing or that you make clever use of equipment, smoothies (Grounded\u2019s potion equivalent), and the environment. In my case, I sought to become a proper melee tryhard who used perfect parries to swat away incoming attacks, wear down the enemy\u2019s stamina, and stun them into oblivion, while my party members dealt death from afar with an arsenal of elemental arrows. Like many things in Grounded, combat starts out as a fairly straightforward affair and quickly escalates into a complicated algorithm that might call for an Excel spreadsheet if you were to map everything out. Early on, you\u2019ll mostly just be blocking, attacking, and navigating the sometimes-tricky terrain to achieve victory \u2013 all table stakes of a standard survival game. But as you\u2019re introduced to beefier and meaner enemies, as well as the inhospitable environments they call home, you\u2019ll have to do research, make decisions about what to craft, upgrade, and carry with you, and switch up how you bring the fight to the insect antagonists. When you enter the Haze area, for example, you\u2019ll need to wear a gas mask to protect against poison, and prepare for things that can fire at you from afar or, worst yet, run up and explode in your face, dealing massive damage to your equipment, which may call for you to bring some ranged options of your own. In another area that\u2019s swarming with powerful larva creatures that deal \u201csizzling\u201d (essentially fire) damage to you, you\u2019ll likely have to rely on melee weapons, well-timed blocking, and fire protection since enemies come at you so fast and in such great numbers. Grounded 1.0 Review Screenshots 10 Images And when facing particularly daunting boss fights or powerful enemy mobs, you\u2019ll want to look up their weaknesses and resistances to know how best to approach the encounter. One enemy might be weak to slashing attacks and salty elemental effects, while another is weak to blunt weapons and spicy elements. All of these things will have an impact on the equipment and strategies your team deploys to achieve victory \u2013 and you\u2019ll need all the help you can get because lots of areas and dungeons are downright nasty and unforgiving. Thankfully, Grounded has a wide variety of enemy types you\u2019ll go to war against. One area of the backyard is dominated by the foul stench of some nearby trash cans, calling for the use of a gas mask. This area becomes infinitely more deadly when you learn that a flying enemy carries around spoiled meat, which breaks your gas mask in seconds if they get too close. The sandbox area, on the other hand, is filled with antlions that can burrow underground only to emerge seconds later from beneath and deal massive damage if you aren\u2019t prepared for it. Even after 100 hours I was still finding new enemies I hadn\u2019t fought yet \u2013 in fact, my Pok\u00e9dex still isn\u2019t complete yet! Best Xbox Game Pass Games 29 Images Most areas within the backyard present their own challenges that require you to adapt, like an underwater dungeon that forced me to swap out my trusty arsenal for equipment that would help me survive the liquidy depths, or another high atop a blueberry bush that challenged my platforming skills and bravery. Each of these dungeons have puzzles to solve and many even feature a boss battle at the conclusion that serves as an ultimate test of your preparedness and skill \u2013 not to mention fitting finales to each chapter of the campaign. You\u2019ll have to stop the laughs and exploration to stare at a grid of precious items. \u201c That said, while running amok in Grounded is almost always a blast, it does occasionally subject you to some painful design choices that bring the good times to an abrupt halt. Chief among these issues is the absolutely tiny inventory space you\u2019re forced to work with in a sandbox that\u2019s absolutely stuffed with things it wants you to loot. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll have to stop the laughs and exploration to stare at a grid of precious items and face a Sophie\u2019s Choice ordeal for what to bring with you and what to leave behind, and you\u2019re given almost zero opportunities to expand your storage space throughout the course of your journey. Even worse, if something you\u2019re carrying breaks and you don\u2019t have space to store it, your character will drop the item on the floor with no notification that you\u2019ve left something behind. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I had to retrace my steps in search of a valuable piece of armor that snapped off me in the heat of battle. The Best Games to Play on Xbox Series X|S 26 Images Similarly, some enemies will just straight-up knock weapons out of your hands and send them sailing into the distance, with no easy way to locate and retrieve them. In one instance, this resulted in me losing my most powerful piece of equipment, which I was never able to recover. I get that I should be expected to lose my weapon if an infected insect explodes in my face, but could you at least give me a map marker to help me track it down later? Decisions like these are especially puzzling when practically every other detail has been painstakingly and beautifully executed, like how when you die and lose your equipment it\u2019s automatically marked indefinitely until it\u2019s recovered, ensuring you can always find and collect anything you\u2019ve lost. But even when I was irritated at my lack of inventory space or some lost, beloved weapon, I kept coming back for more due how much fun it is to work your way through each act of the campaign. After you\u2019ve cleared a dungeon, for example, you immediately gain more insight into the ongoing story and unlock a whole host of new equipment to craft, areas to discover, and enemies to fight (and probably get destroyed by), and that loop is endlessly habit-forming. Just when you start feeling powerful and in control of your slice of the backyard, new opportunities and tribulations open themselves up for you to sink your teeth into, and I found myself losing entire days of my life in what seemed like the blink of an eye. There is one area in which Grounded continues to struggle desperately though, and that\u2019s with its bugs \u2013 and not just the type that skitter about and eat your face off. As has been the case since its debut into early access two years ago, Grounded remains extremely technically rough. In my time with it I experienced regular crashes to the Xbox dashboard, had my co-op teammates get kicked from my world randomly, saw insects and items get stuck inside of objects within the world, had my camera get knocked out of alignment so I could see right into my character\u2019s body, and more. If there\u2019s a silver lining here it\u2019s that none of these issues break anything in any lasting way. Autosave makes sure you don\u2019t lose any significant progress, the camera can easily be reset, and reinviting crestfallen teammates is usually quick and relatively painless. Still, it\u2019s disappointing that we didn\u2019t get a more stable final product after two whole years of early access development."

        "Content": "I wouldn\u2019t expect roller skating and third-person shooting to be a chocolate and peanut butter situation, but Rollerdrome proves it can be just that. By essentially inventing a new single-player sport, OlliOlli World developer Roll7 has found enough ways to make both sides of this unique coin shine without getting overwhelming. Wrap that package in an intriguing world with more going on beyond the sport than you might expect, and I\u2019ve found myself lost in match after match of skate-shooting mayhem. The year is 2030, and you\u2019re entering the Rollerdrome as a new skater, Kara Hassan. This brutally clever dystopian future bloodsport has participants skate and shoot for their lives against waves of \u201chouse players\u201d - aka neatly identifiable enemy classes that range from easy melee combatants to mini-mechs with homing missiles. Most of the time you\u2019ll be chasing  high scores and completing optional challenges in each stage, but Kara\u2019s quest to become champion of the Rollerdrome isn\u2019t just set dressing between the action \u2013 in fact, that story reveals a compelling picture of the rather dark reality it takes place in. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask First-person sections peppered throughout the campaign let you explore locker rooms, office spaces, and a couple other locations before heading into the arena. While they offer the stylish bonus of transitioning directly from first-person to third-person as you enter a match, these sections are also a chance to better understand the part you play in your corporate employer\u2019s machinations. Rollerdrome doesn\u2019t force you to sift through documents or overhear conversations - you can run straight through the door and get into battle - but I\u2019m glad I chose to, because I found an unexpectedly sharp commentary on some pretty relevant topics like the surprising control over all aspects of life a few companies can wield. However, if you are here just for the action, Rollerdrome absolutely delivers. Roll7 has a knack for crafting finely tuned mechanics tied to extreme sports (look to OlliOlli World as further proof from this year alone). Because the skating and the gunplay are happening simultaneously, the developers found clever and, frankly, necessary places to trim back on complexity in to order make sure those two halves mesh well. While skating, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about your speed unless you stop yourself, or an enemy does. Conversely, aiming your weapons is relatively forgiving, too: as long as you\u2019re within range and your crosshairs are pretty close to your mark, an auto-lock will appear. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be precise with your shots, and even hit enemies from further away without the auto lock-on, but some smart concessions ensure both skating and shooting are fun and approachable while still leaving room to be mastered over time. Rollerdrome Slideshow 12 Images Rollerdrome isn\u2019t aiming to be the most complex skate simulator or shooter around, but there\u2019s still plenty of challenge. I consistently delighted in how it rolled out wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies while I also tried to complete a list of Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater-like optional tasks. That could be collecting a set of hidden tokens, landing a specific trick, or killing a giant enemy with your measly pistols\u2026 ok, maybe that last one isn\u2019t quite like Tony Hawk. Gunning down foes is the bulk of what you\u2019ll be doing, with each run serving as a chance to chain together cool kills and sick skating tricks as you learn how to improve your flow through a given stage with every try. Enemy placement isn\u2019t randomized, so you\u2019ll quickly find more efficient paths to maintain momentum and better ways to knock out some of those fun goals on subsequent attempts. The arenas themselves are also gorgeous thanks to Rollerdrome\u2019s bright and colorful art design. There are a handful of different types of environments a level can be themed around, all of which take place in somewhat pedestrian locations like an arid American desert canyon or a mall in the midwest. But that mundanity is by design if you come to understand Rollerdrome\u2019s fascinating world, and their everyday nature doesn\u2019t detract from the pops of color, hard angular linework, and intriguing retro-near-futuristic design. Those locales are also complemented by composer Electric Dragon\u2019s rocking soundtrack, which never lets up as it takes \u201870s-era disco pacing, blends it with \u201880s synth sounds, and tilts it just enough to sound futuristic. Skating Sensation I played Rollerdrome entirely on PS5, and found its use of the DualSense to be pretty admirable. The controller\u2019s haptics have a lot of competing elements to offer feedback on, but there\u2019s a nice balance between the intensity of gunplay and the sensation of grinding a rail vs. skating on the ground to add a nice bit of immersion. The sound of your skating coming through the speaker is a nice bonus, too. It is one of the few games I\u2019ve played recently where my hands were actually tired after playing for extended periods, so perhaps there\u2019s a bit too much feedback at times, especially with the adaptive triggers thrown in to simulate each type of weapon, but on the whole there\u2019s a strong use of the DualSense\u2019s unique features on display. Rollerdrome\u2019s focus on the momentum of the action pulls from the visuals and soundtrack around you and builds that tempo into its mechanics. Each kill notches up your score multiplier, and even just shooting an enemy will let you keep that multiplier from dying out if you\u2019re not able to land finish them off. That most often happened to me because my clip wasn\u2019t full, but Rollerdrome\u2019s creative take on ammo refills meant more bullets were always within reach. Every trick you pull off refills your weapons, and all four of your guns share a collective amount of ammo (which did throw me off the first few times I switched between them). That means you can be grinding past an enemy, recharging your clip on the go so you don\u2019t give them a chance to throw up a defensive shield or attack between shots. I was switching between pistols and shotguns based on enemy type, chaining shots together in between tricks, and falling into a rhythm that was almost zenlike in its flow. Even in failure you can learn how a different weapon choice or another path might have played out better. Learning the level while constantly moving, shooting, and reloading is at the heart of mastering Rollerdrome, but there\u2019s also plenty of room for improvisation as well. The campaign slowly but smartly doles out new enemy types with unique abilities, as well as new weapons, so that I never felt too overwhelmed as I progressed. It\u2019s one thing to take on a guard with a riot shield that is weakest to a shotgun blast, but doing so while two bat-wielding enemies rush you and three missiles are closing in requires quick thinking, so it\u2019s nice that Rollerdrome eases you into the deep end rather than throwing you in headfirst. To help you catch your breath, and look cool while doing it, you can also temporarily slow down time when you press in the left trigger to aim. Slo-mo may be well-worn territory by now, but boy does Rollerdrome\u2019s odd combination of genres make it feel fresh again, turning nearly every slowed-down attack into a screenshot-worthy moment. Slo-mo may be well-worn territory, but Rollerdrome\u2019s use of it turns nearly every slowed-down attack into a screenshot-worthy moment. \u201c Even when you\u2019re being pelted with sniper beams, homing missiles, land mines, and more, Rollerdrome offers a chance to dodge and enable a Super Reflex mode, which slows down time even further while boosting the power of your shots. It\u2019s a consistently satisfying reward, but never feels too overpowering thanks to the limited (but fair) amount of ammo you have before needing to pull off some more tricks. You\u2019ll certainly need to make good use of this ability by the end too \u2013 nearly all of Rollerdrome\u2019s wide variety of enemies try to stop you in its last couple of stages, and I barely made it out of those bouts on my first couple of tries. There\u2019s almost too much going on at first glance, but a replay or two later and I felt much more comfortable with those deceptively tough final fights. The biggest diversions from its regular campaign levels are a pair of boss battles that are both a highlight and a disappointment. They put a clever twist on the usual mechanics, forcing you to contend with a single, massive enemy rather than waves of smaller ones, and tearing that first behemoth apart is a blast. But the subsequent boss fight doesn\u2019t change that formula up much, so it didn\u2019t feel like a substantially different challenge. Seeing the ingenuity on hand originally, I had hoped for a few more fresh spins in the second boss fight, or even other cool takes on larger enemies before the end.

Surfing Puzzle Game Motocross Dating Sim Skateboarding RTS Skiing Battle Royale Paragliding MOBA Answer See Results But that\u2019s more of a momentary blip in Rollerdrome\u2019s otherwise thrilling experience. And if you\u2019re having as much fun with it by the end of the roughly 5-hour campaign as I was (with another few hours already spent replaying levels), there\u2019s a brutal and surprising new option that opens up afterward. The \u201cOut for Blood\u201d campaign offers remixed versions of previous levels with every enemy type available from the first battle (and a remix of the great soundtrack alongside them). I tried the first few and these are no joke, especially if you consider any of the base levels tough, but they should make for an even more rewarding proving ground if you can survive."

Enjoy it, because even though Tunic may look like a simplistic isometric action-adventure that draws clear inspiration from the early Legend of Zelda games, it is in reality a decidedly hardcore experience that will fiercely test both your mind and your combat abilities. It\u2019s not \u201ckiddier Zelda,\u201d as its bushy-tailed hero suggests (though Tunic himself should be made into a real-life plush immediately). Instead, Tunic caught me off guard with its challenging combat and complex puzzles, and once I regained my footing I found that it executes on that premise wonderfully. One of my favorite things about Tunic is that, like the old-school classics it clearly takes inspiration from, it tells you nothing . Less than nothing, in fact: nearly all of its dialogue and in-game language is in an indecipherable script, Tunic never speaks, and there are no objective markers, hints, or breadcrumb trails to speak of. Everything must be intuited, which is done partly through exploration but primarily through the individual pages of the in-game instruction manual that you\u2019ll find scattered about the world.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The booklet is modeled after what you\u2019d find in the box in a NES-era game, complete with handwritten scribbles and annotations on some of the pages. This manual, too, is written in Tunic\u2019s own language, but you\u2019ll be able to suss out clues and directions from the images contained within \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like an IKEA instruction manual, but it\u2019s a similar idea. Paying close attention to it is absolutely vital, as my cautionary tale proves; I ended up going into an early boss fight severely underpowered, but the frustration I felt as a result of that was my own fault for not reading the manual studiously enough to have figured out the key bit I was missing. It\u2019s an exceptionally clever way to guide us through, even if it might have you seeking out the IGN wiki from time to time (no shame in that!). It\u2019s an exceptionally clever way to guide us through. \u201c When you\u2019re not nose-down in your pieced-together instruction manual, you\u2019re out in either the overworld or one of the many dungeons where you\u2019ll be slashing, blocking, dashing, and dodge-rolling your way to victory against Tunic\u2019s wide variety of enemies. Importantly, you don\u2019t really learn any new moves after you acquire the sword in the first hour; instead, it\u2019s your tactics that will have to evolve. This includes making good use of not just that basic set of moves in new ways but also your items, the applications of which are also not explained at all. From sticks of dynamite to magic items later on \u2013 all of which you\u2019ll find hidden in chests around the world and able to be bought from a terrifying but harmless shopkeeper \u2013 figuring out what each one does and employing them with smart strategies will lead to success far more often than quick button-mashing will. But sometimes you\u2019ll need both. How tired are you of hearing games compared to Dark Souls? Not at all - it's a very influential series! A little Extremely Truly, this is the Dark Souls of poll questions Answer See Results My favorite among those items is easily the aforementioned sticks of dynamite you\u2019ll have access to right from the jump. They\u2019re useful all game long, particularly during boss fights. Sure, they\u2019re nice for clearing out clusters of bad guys, but against a boss\u2019s intimidatingly large health bar the TNT is one of the most reliable ways to take sizable chunks off of it. They benefit from a certain\u2026 unpredictability in how they work due to their physics. Don\u2019t try to throw them at an opponent on a ledge, for instance; sure, Tunic\u2019s got a pretty good arm, but the dynamite doesn\u2019t explode on contact. Rather, it will hit your target, then bounce off and roll around on the ground \u2013 depending how it lands \u2013 before finally combusting. Enemies in or around water are effectively impervious to dynamite as well, as the lit sticks instantly fizzle out if they touch water... as you\u2019d expect if you think about it. Like the old-school classics it clearly takes inspiration from, Tunic tells you nothing. \u201c No matter their size, your opponents are no pushovers \u2013 even the simplest of foes, like a Husher or a Autobolt, can drain your health rapidly. Their AI doesn\u2019t stand out as overly smart or stupid, but each one hits with a wallop. Larger hero versions of the vanilla baddies of various types move slower but hit harder, and that healthy helping of boss battles are not to be taken lightly. Good luck. And if you\u2019re wondering, you can only save your game at flame-lit shrines scattered about the world, and while doing so will restore your health and magic bars, the trade-off is that all of the enemies reset, too. That\u2019s an obvious nod to Dark Souls . Let\u2019s talk a little more about those boss battles. They are many, they are memorable, and they are the good kind of nasty. There are no difficulty settings to choose from in Tunic; there is only \u201cFigure It Out.\u201d A simple multi-hit sword-attack combo is both hinted at in your manual pages and something you might discover on your own anyway, and it will be crucial to your chances of survival. Even more vital to your ability to stand toe-to-toe with Tunic\u2019s bosses, however, is the dodge roll that gives you a very brief window of invincibility. Mastering it is a must, as is being able to quickly cycle through the items you might need that aren\u2019t already hotkeyed to X, Y, and B. The moment you finally take down each boss genuinely feels like a victory well-earned. There are no difficulty settings to choose from in Tunic; there is only \u201cFigure It Out.\u201d \u201c As in a classic, top-down Zelda, Tunic has many Metroidvania-style layers to eventually peel back, and this, too, is part of what I love about it. When you see some place you can\u2019t reach, or some door you can\u2019t access, or something you can\u2019t figure out how to activate, know that you will eventually get that tool \u2013 and when you return to see what\u2019s been quietly making you crazy for many hours you\u2019ll finally have satisfaction. Tunic\u2019s world, in general, is a lovely place as well. The overworld is bright and colorful, while each dungeon has its own look and feel, from the traditional-fantasy spider cave at one end of the spectrum to the almost-sci-fi Monastery at the other. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images But Tunic\u2019s mysteries don\u2019t all show themselves early on and torture you until the late-game. Rather, new head-scratching conundrums are constantly revealing themselves, meaning you\u2019ve always got a new lead to chase if you get frustrated or hit a dead end on the trail you\u2019ve been following. This includes the run up to and past the endgame, where the knowledge you\u2019ve accrued acts as momentum that can lead you to a number of puzzle-solves and revelations in short order as you go back and figure out things that you\u2019ve previously walked by or stared at dozens of times, but there\u2019s still plenty of brain-bending to be done after the credits roll as well. On that note, Tunic\u2019s story is an interesting one as you piece it together, but admittedly not one I felt particularly moved by or satisfied with by the end. My 15-20-hour journey mattered a lot more than the destination for me, but perhaps you\u2019ll feel differently."

GT7 achieves this via the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9, an eccentric but effective little hub that the developers at Polyphony have placed right in the middle of its world map. When we drop in, the caf\u00e9 owner assigns us specific races and tasks via a series of 39 so-called \u201cmenu books.\u201d Working through those gradually introduces new drivers to how things work in GT \u2013 from earning licences and finding and buying cars, to customisation and racing. Some of it may initially seem like busywork to long-time GT players, but the racing events the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9 deliberately threads us through all make up part of the large list of career races we\u2019d be otherwise doing anyhow \u2013 and the decent collection of reward cars offered for working through the menu books makes it well worth your time. Gran Turismo 7 is the most welcoming GT ever. \u201c You\u2019ll definitely be able to win many more cars this way than you\u2019d be able to afford to buy in your first week with GT7, that much is clear. Payouts aren\u2019t particularly extravagant and car upgrade costs can be surprisingly high for some items, like tyres that cost twice as much as an entire MX-5, or $100,000 nitrous systems no amount of boosted DVD players would ever pay for. Even neat ideas, like the huge range of official manufacturer paint colours we can use in the design booth, annoyingly come with a cost attached. Microtransaction Reaction Update, March 7, 2022: Since the publishing of Gran Turismo 7\u2019s reviews Sony has flicked the switch on its microtransactions and the news is as we suspected \u2013 and, in some ways, much worse. As it appeared, GT7 is based on a direct cash-for-credits scheme (as opposed to GT Sport\u2019s microtransaction functionality, which allowed players to purchase individual cars valued up to 2 million in-game credits with real money instead of in-game credits). US PSN prices for GT Sport's cars. This means instead of being able to purchase cars individually, which in GT Sport range in price between US$1 and US$5, players tempted to accelerate their GT7 car collections by using real money need to shell out for batches of in-game credits. There are four tiers of credits available: 100,000 credits \u2013 US$2.50 / \u00a32 / AU$3.75 250,000 credits \u2013 US$5 / \u00a34 / AU$7.55 750,000 credits \u2013 US$10 / \u00a38 / AU$15 2,000,000 credits \u2013 US$20 / \u00a316 / AU$30 GT7's credits are shockingly expensive. There are several glaring problems associated with this new approach to microtransactions. At a basic level, the limited set of tiers means there\u2019ll regularly be no way for a player to purchase exactly the amount of credits they may want for a particular car. Just want 1 million credits? Well, you\u2019ll have to spend US$15 on packs of 750,000 credits and 250,000 credits, or US$20 on twice as many credits as you wanted. It\u2019s a pretty gross approach considering all these cars are on the disc already and very much part of your initial purchase. At a fundamental level, though, these credit prices are simply out of control. For example, if you wanted to fast-track your way behind the wheel of a 2014 Lamborghini Veneno in GT Sport, you could pay US$5 and purchase this car direct from the PS Store. But in GT7 this process is now rendered hideously more expensive. To purchase the Veneno in GT7, which costs 3,640,000 credits in-game, you\u2019d need to hand over US$40 (\u00a332/AU$60) for 4 million GT bucks \u2013 a 700% increase! These aren\u2019t microtransactions anymore; they\u2019re maxitransactions. Again, these aren\u2019t even DLC add-ons, either; these are vehicles that are in the game already. It's especially dismaying that the full scope of this new cash-for-credits scheme was only revealed after the review process was completed. Yes, it is an optional shortcut, but considering credits build fairly slowly via racing, you can\u2019t sell cars from your garage, and a number of GT7\u2019s coolest cars have been made artificially scarce, at what point do we call it predatory? With rare cars in the legendary dealer rotating in availability before they\u2019re \u201csold out\u201d (and unobtainable to you in your single-player game), and others that require peculiar, time-limited, in-game invitations to actually purchase, it\u2019s definitely easy to see how some players who know they won\u2019t have the time to build a large amount of credits by racing may be compelled to part with real cash to snag certain cars before they\u2019re gone. Original, March 2, 2022: Gran Turismo 7 features the shady ability to top-up your in-game credit balance with real money via the PlayStation Store. At the time of publish the link to do so directly from the various purchase screens in-game is not functioning, so we're unable to see how much credits cost. It would seem that this is a different approach to the microtransactions added to GT Sport in 2018 (which was around a year after it was reported it would not feature microtransactions ). The microtransactions added to GT Sport allowed cars to be directly purchased a la carte for real money; GT7 appears to be a cash-for-credits scheme. Either way, GT7's microtransactions have me feeling a bit cynical overall, especially considering how hard GT7 leans into making some of its coolest cars artificially scarce. Some rare cars will only pop up occasionally to buy before they're \"sold out\", and others require peculiar, time-limited, in-game invitations to actually purchase. It's easy to see how the fear of missing out may coax some players who are light on credits to shell out real cash to grab certain cars before they disappear again. Nevertheless, collecting each themed trio of cars for the GT Caf\u00e9\u2019s menu books (like European classic compacts, or retro Japanese sports icons) also unlocks a sweetly earnest short video that showcases the cars and explains their relevance to automotive culture. These vignettes are clearly aimed at people with a more limited background in motoring history than I have but I still admire Polyphony\u2019s efforts to try and add context to why certain cars are here. That said, while some of these collections are very historically robust and can properly chart the lineage of certain iconic models, some others are hamstrung by GT7\u2019s limited pool of cars to pull from. For instance, GT7\u2019s Supra and GT-R collections are great examples of menu books that span decades of motoring evolution, but others have to take a bit more of a grab-bag approach. GT7\u2019s car roster exceeding 400 sounds good on paper (and it surpasses the nearly 350 that 2017\u2019s GT Sport ended up with after several years of updates) but accounting for multiple variations of the fantasy Vision GT cars, the race car versions of road cars, and then the reverse \u201croad car\u201d versions of some of those race cars, that 400 figure shrinks a bit. It\u2019s really only around half the cars available in Forza Motorsport 7, the crosstown rival racer it originally inspired. The reality is the garage in GT7 is not nearly as rich as you may expect \u2013 and certainly not as current. With a few exceptions, most manufacturers\u2019 ranges tend to top out at around 2017. If you\u2019re expecting to see quite a few high-profile cars from the last two or three years here, like the latest McLarens or any Tesla built since 2012, you may be disappointed. Gran Turismo 7 Launch Screenshots - March 2022 102 Images Handle with Flair Crucially, however, the car handling is quite impeccable \u2013 and virtually every single car I\u2019ve driven feels appreciably different from the last. Retro road cars feel lairy and loose, and they can become wilder still with some extra oomph squeezed under the bonnet as proper performance tuning returns to the series after its absence from GT Sport. Modern sports cars feel a bit more planted but they\u2019re nothing like the dedicated race models, which are stiff and cling to the tarmac like their tyres have talons. In what feels like an improvement on GT Sport, grip doesn\u2019t quite disappear off a cliff the moment I overcook a corner exit. I\u2019ve found I\u2019m able to drive out of trouble more often after perching a car in a slide. I have my reservations about the off-road handling \u2013 specifically how it deals with jumps \u2013 but GT7 is amazing on asphalt. Like GT Sport before it GT7 seriously sings on a steering wheel (I\u2019m using the Thrustmaster T-GT) but know that it still feels absolutely at home on a DualSense controller, and I haven\u2019t felt like it\u2019s a disadvantage; in fact, I\u2019ve achieved gold cups in the bulk of the license tests using a controller. I have found the weaker of the two countersteering assists useful in some vehicles because it takes some of the dramatic edge off my car\u2019s bulk snapping from side to side \u2013 something that can be a little tricky to intuit with only the tiny amount of travel possible on an analogue stick compared to a wheel \u2013 but if you require more assists GT7 features plenty of them, all the way up to full auto-braking. GT7 may be a serious racer, but it\u2019s not an entirely inaccessible one. What We Said About Gran Turismo Sport Gran Turismo Sport is a very well-crafted online racing destination. It\u2019s serious, sensible, structured, and \u2013 unlike Sony\u2019s previous first-party racing game, DriveClub \u2013 it\u2019s been reliable since launch. It\u2019s also supremely good-looking, well-presented, and handles great. However, the hard pivot to an online-focused racing sim has seen it lose a slab of its single-player mode, it lacks meaningful weather effects, and its garage and track selection is startlingly stingy next to the competition. \u2013 Luke Reilly, October 18, 2017 Score: 7.5 Read the full Gran Turismo Sport review The PS5 DualSense\u2019s haptic feedback also rates a positive mention. There are times where it feels like it\u2019s trying to deliver a few too many sensations simultaneously to really grasp what each is trying to illustrate \u2013 so it\u2019s just a lot of whirring and buzzing, all at once \u2013 but the DualSense otherwise copes with GT7 splendidly. The response to curbs is particularly nuanced, and there are some other bits of feedback that are unique to particular tracks that feels very cool \u2013 like the whirr from whipping over the metal grates that stretch across the Tokyo expressway circuit. That this buzz feels distinct in my hands from the clunk of a gear change is exactly the type of thing I\u2019m keen to keep seeing done with the DualSense. It remains a shame that Polyphony keeps compromising its high-quality driving by persisting with frustrating rolling starts for career mode events. \u201c However, it remains a shame that Polyphony keeps compromising its high-quality driving by persisting with frustrating rolling starts for career mode events, repeating the same mistake GT6 made. In a real-life motor race, cars cruise closely in two rows for rolling starts. But in GT7 career races, the cars are arranged in single file, 50-odd metres apart, and we are always placed in last. In a race with 20 opponents at Mount Panorama, this means the leader is already all the way up Mountain Straight and approaching the Cutting by the time we cross the starting line. In simple terms, that\u2019s well over a kilometre away . These ridiculous head starts mean career events are less a race than they are a chase. We\u2019re not dogfighting for track position with backmarkers; we\u2019re simply blazing past them trying to negate the immense starting deficit. The racing really just amounts to an overtaking challenge, which GT7 already officially has a bunch of in its addictive set of driving mission challenges. What\u2019s mystifying is that GT7 has a great and extremely granular custom race creator that features grid starts so we know there\u2019s no technical reason not to have them. It just\u2026 doesn\u2019t use them where they\u2019d work best. Tracing Game Starting out in GT7 on PS5 you\u2019ll be offered the choice between two graphics modes: a performance mode that prioritises the frame rate at all times, and a ray tracing mode that applies ray tracing to certain non-gameplay scenarios (you can switch between them at any time). Ray tracing can be active in things like the photo mode, replays, and the garage, but I honestly don\u2019t feel the juice is worth the squeeze. With ray tracing on the camera tends to jitter a bit when panning across interiors, and I actually think the cars tend to look sharper and better without it. In fact, GT7\u2019s greatest lighting victory has little to do with its ray tracing mode at all: its fantastic time-of-day effects bathe the fabulous set of circuits in supremely realistic and always-changing light. Watching as the crisp afternoon sun gave way to the pink and purple hues of dusk atop Mount Panorama I was seriously impressed; it\u2019s distractingly good. GT7\u2019s dynamic time-of-day and weather effects aren\u2019t a genre first but they have finally pushed its tracks to the next level \u2013 and they\u2019re doubly cool when applied to returning original GT circuits like High Speed Ring, Deep Forest, and fan favourite Trial Mountain. GT7\u2019s dynamic time-of-day and weather effects aren\u2019t a genre first but they have finally pushed its tracks to the next level. \u201c It's just a great-looking package all around, really. I quite like the smaller details, from the way the pit crews clamber up fences to pump their fists and wave flags on the last lap in championship races to the way tow hooks, decals, and unique aero parts begin to naturally appear on tuned AI opponents as you move up through the competition ranks. Those aero parts are the result of a neat wing editor that allows us to select from different end plates and wing heights rather than make do with a small handful of presets, and they\u2019re just one of a bunch of innovations hidden in GT7\u2019s cosmetic and performance customisation. I\u2019m a real fan of the straightforward detuning that\u2019s now possible in the settings screen; it\u2019s now much easier to keep your most-loved cars on track when performance limits fluctuate between events by simply adding ballast or turning down the engine computer (rather than heading back to the garage to strip off parts to make something race legal). Everything Must Go While the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9 is a clever experiment that works, GT7\u2019s new music features \u2013 which were a large focus of February\u2019s extensive GT7 reveal \u2013 feel like a bust. They\u2019re both let down by an ostensibly large music library that ranges from mostly forgettable to outright weird. What's the Gran Turismo series' greatest driving tune? Everything Must Go (Chemical Brothers Remix) - Manic Street Preachers Lose Control - Ash My Favourite Game - The Cardigans Are You Gonna Go My Way (Gran Turismo Remix) - Lenny Kravitz Just a Day - Feeder Kickstart My Heart - M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce Reason Is Treason (Jack Knife Lee Remix) - Kasabian Panama - Van Halen SURV1V3 - Daiki Kasho Planetary (GO!) - My Chemical Romance Other: tell us in the comments! Answer See Results The Music Replay feature works as advertised \u2013 and I understand that the race replay cameras are being generated around the track dynamically depending on how fast my car is travelling and switching in time with the music \u2013 but the effect isn\u2019t particularly seismic or stirring. Music Rally, an arcade-style mode where we start with a certain number of beats which tick down as a song plays and need to be topped up by passing through extension gates, has turned out to be a particularly odd focus. \u201cQuirky\u201d is the polite way to describe it, but \u201cbaffling\u201d is probably the more accurate. It\u2019s admittedly hard for me to gauge how a 2022 audience will respond to hustling around a track to classical disco megamixes from 1982, but personally I\u2019m confused as hell here. It\u2019s hard to gauge how a 2022 audience will respond to hustling around a track to classical disco megamixes from 1982. \u201c Most disappointingly, for a series with a baked-in history of associated music tracks that are seared into the minds of millions, this wasn\u2019t the direction Polyphony went with Music Rally. It gets frustratingly close, with one of the songs in Music Rally plucked from the opening movie to the PAL version of GT5 Prologue on PS3, but that\u2019s it. A Music Rally mode stacked with songs from the heyday of Gran Turismo, like My Favourite Game by The Cardigans, The Chemical Brothers remix of Everything Must Go, or any of the Ash, Feeder, and Lenny Kravitz tunes that made up those early intro movies and soundtracks? That would have been a very clever hook. As it stands, though, the six currently available Music Rally events are mostly a bit bizarre and boring. Even more confusingly, it\u2019s one of only two modes that function offline. Like GT Sport before it, everything else in the single-player mode (except an arcade mode with a tiny selection of cars) requires an online connection. That you can\u2019t access online multiplayer in this case is obviously a given, but the fact you can\u2019t even access the two-player mode offline has me stumped. That needless connectivity isn\u2019t as big a problem for most people in 2022 as it was a few years back but it\u2019s still something to be aware of. While the PvP online component was really the crux of GT Sport, GT7 doesn\u2019t emphasise it in quite the same way, letting the single-player campaign flex its muscles. With rotating, scheduled racing and championships, Sport mode in GT7 still functions the same as it does in GT Sport, though, so I fully expect it\u2019ll be a similarly strong online racing venue. GT7 also adds some more low-stakes multiplayer options, including lobbies where players can meet up on most of the circuits, tool around with no specific race settings, and just chat, compare cars, and cruise. These may descend into bedlam following GT7\u2019s launch, but I think the idea is sound."

We've finally come to the end of the sweeping dark fantasy trilogy that began six years ago, and Total War: Warhammer 3 is a worthy capstone. With interesting campaign mechanics that build up rivalries between its memorable main cast and several new armies that don't play like anything we've seen in Total War before, it excels on just about every level, strategic and tactical. And a collection of little quality-of-life changes carried over from other recent Total War games tie the single-player campaign up with a nice little bloodsoaked bow. The main campaign in Warhammer 3 is very story-driven, even more so than Warhammer 2's Eye of the Vortex. And that can be both a good and bad thing. Having completed it three times now, I don't think it has the endlessly replayable sandbox potential of the Mortal Empires campaign available to owners of the first two games. And while Warhammer 3 will eventually get its own version of that, Creative Assembly has said we might be waiting a while for it. Currently, you can't even play as any of the Warhammer 1 and 2 races in skirmish battles, though they do appear on the campaign map as enemies to be vanquished. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask So if you're looking to just pick a faction and conquer the world at your own pace, you're better off sticking with Mortal Empires for now. The pacing of this new campaign is almost too hectic, as you race against the other major factions to claim four Daemon Prince souls and free, slay, or perhaps even devour the bear god Ursun. You can set your own goals to an extent, but you're not exactly going to have free hands to pursue them. There are some upsides to that, like allowing your lesser generals to build up reputations and niches of their own while Skarbrand or Miao Ying are off fighting through the Chaos Realms half the time. Or better yet, having your faction leader return in a blaze of vengeance from a foray into Hell to reclaim settlements you lost in their absence. But I also felt like I was constantly being herded toward the final battle by forces beyond my control, which can harsh my buzz if I'm just having fun smashing some puny humans. Those mechanics allow for a type of scenario Total War has never attempted. \u201c This urging takes shape as something that's halfway between a traditional Total War experience and a single-player campaign in an RTS like Warcraft 3, and looked at from that perspective it\u2019s excellent. Each Chaos realm you must assault has its own unique challenge to solve that reflects the character of the dark deity who owns it, and culminates in an exciting new type of battle that has you fighting your way through some truly harrowing, horde-style maps using your ability to build defenses and call in reinforcements. Those mechanics allow for a type of scenario Total War has never attempted, and it\u2019s refreshing to see the time-tested formula used in new ways. Every IGN Total War Review Ever 20 Images We Built This City Regular siege battles have been reworked to use these systems as well, which makes them much more tactically interesting and keeps them from all playing out exactly the same, as could happen in Warhammer 2. However, there are probably too many ways to breach the walls now, making outer fortifications feel like more of a speed bump than a real obstacle as an attacker or useful resource as a defender. It can be exciting to have to fall back steadily through a city as a siege progresses, but I'd like these giant defensive structures I built to at least keep out some of the less determined invaders. What We Said About Total War: Warhammer 2 I feel like a broken record saying this is the best Total War game so far, since I\u2019ve felt that way about each major release since Attila. But it really is true: Creative Assembly\u2019s designers are honing their campaign and faction design consistently from game to game, and that progression is clearly on display in Total War Warhammer 2. There\u2019s not as much progress as I\u2019d have liked to see in the politics and diplomacy systems, which show only modest improvements. But each of the four factions is a distinct and fun-to-play addition to the growing roster. The story and objective-driven campaign is a league above anything we\u2019ve seen in the entire Total War series before in both design and presentation. I\u2019m anxious to see how it all fits together when the combined Moral Empires campaign is released to owners of both games later this year. - Leana Hafer, September 25, 2017 Score: 9.1 Read the full Total War: Warhammer 2 Review The battle maps all look gorgeous, though. Well, except the ones that are supposed to be horrifying, like the putrid swamps of Nurgle or impossible spiraling towers of Tzeentch, which are appropriately breathtaking in their own way. The campaign map, though, looks a bit less detailed than Warhammer 2. Some of the ground textures are noticeably lower-res, and especially some of the trees and vegetation seem to have had their polygon budget gutted, even on max settings. The map is also considerably bigger than even Mortal Empires, so I can understand if this had to be done for performance reasons. And it does run very well on my Ryzen 7 3700X/RTX 2060 Super-driven system, only rarely dropping below 30fps at 1080p with everything cranked up. I'd miss the heck out of these if I went back to Warhammer 2. \u201c While the campaign map itself wasn't always dazzling, the new diplomatic options and quality-of-life features it brings are some of the best parts of Warhammer 3. They're the easiest upgrades to forget about when you quickly get used to them, but I'd miss the heck out of them if I went back to Warhammer 2. The brilliant Quick Deal button we first saw in Total War: Three Kingdoms makes it easy to see who would be willing to sign a trade agreement without having to open every faction's embassy individually. A \"Balance Deal\" button cuts down on what must have added up to hours I used to have to spend just to see how much gold I could get out of a peace treaty by trying different amounts over and over. Now we can cut out the haggling and get down to business. Which Total War: Warhammer 3 faction are you playing first? Khorne Slaanesh Tzeentch Nurgle Daemons of Chaos Cathay Kislev Ogre Kingdoms Answer See Results On top of that, alliances are much more rewarding than what we\u2019ve seen in the previous two games, since here you can construct outposts in allied settlements that let you recruit their units as a return on your investment. So if you're playing as the Daemons of Khorne and you need some ranged firepower to complement your extremely melee-focused horde of bloodthirsty ravagers, making friends with Tzeentch will give you four army slots that can be spent on his units. There's also a useful new favors system that can allow you to, among other cool things, just borrow an entire army stack from an ally temporarily. All of the newcomer factions in Warhammer 3 are creative, fresh, and interesting. \u201c Even without cross-faction recruitment, all of the newcomer factions in Warhammer 3 are creative, fresh, and interesting in and of themselves. Slaanesh can seduce units to his side in battle and even beguile entire factions. Cathay can send caravans off to the far-flung corners of the world and they send back exciting random events and the chance to have heroes from other factions join your caravan. And Khorne spawns free armies when razing a settlement, which can then go on to raze more settlements and spawn more free armies, creating the most gleefully aggro faction in a world with a lot of very aggro factions. One of the hardest decisions was simply deciding which one I wanted to try out next. Total War: Warhammer 3 Review Screenshots 17 Images My Little Apocalypse And that\u2019s just on the strategic map; they each have a distinct and novel feel on the battlefield, too. Tzeentch's units have barriers that recharge when they're out of combat, encouraging hit-and-run tactics. Cathay's harmony system rewards you for keeping ranged and melee troops together, making them the ultimate combined arms formation army. The Ogre Kingdoms have infantry that can carry around cast iron artillery guns like it's no big deal, which has led to some of my most hilarious and joyfully lopsided victories.

They all improve what came before them by conjuring up exciting new gameplay mechanics, developing characters through engaging stories, and switching up mission design to offer variety. In other words, they take a solid base and combine with new elements to create more advanced bonds, much like an alloy\u2026 or in this case, an Aloy. Horizon Forbidden West does this with aplomb, building on the already impressive foundations of 2017\u2019s Horizon Zero Dawn to tell a thrilling story full of familiar explosive combat against elaborate robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, but also adding Witcher-like settlements to the map and filling it out with great side quests. There\u2019s a genuine sense of exploration and loads of completely involving lore behind it all to uncover. The result is a fantastic open-world action-adventure that, despite falling into a couple of its old habits, emphatically delivers on the promises made five years ago. The battle between the natural and firmly unnatural is everywhere to see in the Forbidden West. It drills down through many levels to what the Horizon series is all about, from the vines strangling the remains of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge to the animal-like man-made machines that wander the land, tracing the footsteps of their long-dead creators. But this clash also takes place inside Aloy, who (spoilers for the first game) herself is a complicated combination of human and synthetic life. It's what drives the plot along and lends a personal touch to what could be otherwise ungainly themes if handled without the obvious care that developer Guerrilla Games has put into Forbidden West.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Take the Power Back Once again, Aloy is on a time-sensitive mission packed with mystery, not least in its characters, many of whom are firmly established in the grey area between friend or foe. Its twists and turns are numerous and had me guessing how it would turn out right until the end of Aloy's journey. That journey isn't a short one; my playthrough (which was done at a fairly relaxed pace that included completing a healthy amount of side missions) took around 32 hours. Guerrilla has definitely learned a lesson this time around when it comes to finding a balance between worldbuilding and telling a coherent story. Horizon Zero Dawn tackled some big, ambitious ideas, but sometimes stumbled when it came to conveying them in an engaging way, with an over-reliance on audio and text files found in lifeless labs and abandoned offices. With the stage now firmly set, though, Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes fell victim to, (mostly) mercifully avoiding lengthy information dumps in favour of a more elegantly told tale. While there are still a decent amount of audio logs to find, the quality of them is much improved, and more importantly, this time around all of the story\u2019s key moments are told through engaging cutscenes that contain their fair share of character-centric drama without dwelling on it long enough to overstay their welcome. Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes fell victim to. \u201c This is still very much a hard sci-fi setting, though, and that is where the slightly weaker parts of Forbidden West\u2019s story lay during the opening hours. Sometimes it just can't help but stray into overlong monologues referring back to the events of Zero Dawn and the setup for the journey west, and that\u2019s where some momentum is lost. This makes for an uneven start, but the pace promptly picks up and becomes much more engaging once a new threat is introduced and the true plot of Forbidden West comes to the fore. From here on it successfully rumbles on its way to a full-on bonkers, yet highly enjoyable ending. It's also worth noting here that Forbidden West is very much a sequel to Zero Dawn, meaning newcomers attempting to skip the line and jump in here may feel slightly alienated by the overarching plot, though there's still plenty to enjoy regardless. The story's strengths, however, far outweigh those awkward moments. It's much stronger when focusing on the personal dramas and social and political conflicts of the Forbidden West than when satiating its fetish for rambling holograms. If Horizon Zero Dawn was about Aloy discovering a dangerous new world, Forbidden West is all about a new world discovering just how dangerous Aloy can be. After the events of Zero Dawn, she\u2019s a living legend: worshiped by some, feared by others. The present-day political turmoil between warring tribes paints a tense backdrop with plenty of room for great moments to play out in front of. There are some real standout missions , too: one questline involving a clumsy but loveable inventor trying to fulfill the ambitious legacy of his grandfather is a particular highpoint. It\u2019s a perfect example of how well Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable. Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable. \u201c There are fantastic character moments that are delivered with a deft touch; it's a credit to the writers that I found myself caring so much about the fate of these people so quickly after meeting them. This goes for the actors embodying the characters, too \u2013 performances are brilliant across the board, with no one feeling out of place and even the most incidental seeming characters well observed. That\u2019s no mean feat considering the large cast of fresh faces you'll meet throughout your playthrough. What We Said About Horizon Zero Dawn Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion. - Lucy O'Brien, February 20, 2017 Score: 9.3 Read the full Horizon Zero Dawn review Part of that is due to the fact that Forbidden West is far more concerned about the world as a whole and the people surrounding Aloy than Zero Dawn ever was; from early on it becomes apparent that the whole lesson of the story for Aloy is allowing some of the pressure she places on herself to be carried by others. The supporting cast does a great job of keeping you company, and Varl \u2013 an old friend of Aloy\u2019s from the Nora tribe who is with you from the opening moments \u2013 in particular, provides warm companionship throughout and brings the best out of Aloy. It\u2019s a pleasant change when compared to the often-lonely adventure of Zero Dawn. Actors Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story; the former provides a fearsome presence as rebel leader Regala, even if she is too absent for long stretches to feel like a prominent piece of the story. Meanwhile, Moss brings a touch of class to proceedings as the enigmatic Tilda. It\u2019s never enough to wrestle the limelight away from Ashly Burch as Aloy, though. Naturally, she\u2019s at the core of everything in Forbidden West, and Burch carries that weight with confidence and panache \u2013 displaying power in loud, pivotal moments, but also shining in the story's quieter, more heartfelt pockets. Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story. \u201c On the topic of the loud parts, while Zero Dawn may have been action-packed, its presentation never felt nearly as cinematic as this. Massive moments take place in masterfully choreographed cutscenes with swirling camerawork reminiscent of a Tony Scott chase sequence. It may seem simple, but subtler techniques (such as a wider lens used during conversations) add a filmic quality to dialogue-heavy scenes, allowing characters to use their bodies to move expressively and convey a wider range of emotion. Feelings run high over the course of the lengthy campaign, and while this isn\u2019t anything like the trauma fest of something like The Last of Us Part 2, Forbidden West certainly tugs on the heartstrings. Know Your Enemy A stealthy approach, laying in wait to silently strike from tall grass, is almost always wise at the start of a fight as you'll likely get into the most trouble when you\u2019re outnumbered. Even the less deadly machines, such as darting Skydrifters and pouncing Scrappers, pose a threat in numbers, and left unchecked they\u2019ll relentlessly unleash attack after attack. Rarely has the saying \"attack is the best form of defense\" been truer, and just as in Zero Dawn these enemies\u2019 bodies are loaded with weak points that allow you to affect the way they fight and change it to your liking. Take the new Clawstrider, for example: it\u2019s an extremely aggressive dino menace that can wipe you out with lashes of its devastating tail. Had enough of it? Equip some tear arrows and split your tormentor's tail straight off. Alternatively, coat it with a yellow gloop using the new adhesive ammo to slow it down, which is extremely effective against quick machines like this. That cycle of learning an enemy and their multiple different attacks, reducing the number of options available to them by targeting and destroying their weapons, and then finishing them off with ice, fire, acid, or whatever other damage types they\u2019re weak to never grew tired over dozens of hours. The combat in Zero Dawn was already fantastic, and Forbidden West only stacks more options on top of that \u2013 such as new weapons and ammo types \u2013 and feels better and more flexible than ever as a result. The explosive Spike Thrower is a particularly satisfying new addition to Aloy\u2019s collection of weaponry, lodging projectiles into machines before detonating them to cause big damage. I found this to be a near-essential item against some of Forbidden West\u2019s bigger beasts. Many of these battles are of a scale and a quality that many games would aspire to for their grand finales. Knocking off their heavy weapons and then picking them up to turn their own guns against them adds a dynamic edge that rewards good aim with more firepower. Cleaving the cannon off of a Ravager and unleashing a barrage into the side of Tremortusk \u2013 a gigantic and very angry robot mammoth \u2013 is a pure, unadulterated power trip. The superb score also soundtracks perfectly throughout, dynamically cranking up the noise during high-stakes battles and adding crunchy electronics to the familiar orchestral refrains from Zero Dawn. Battles are of a scale and a quality that many games would aspire to for their grand finales. \u201c The central piece of Aloy\u2019s arsenal remains the bow and arrow though, with many different versions on offer. Mixing and matching to make sure you have all of the different types of elemental damage you need on your weapon wheel is key; the next step is being skilled enough to hit your fast-moving targets. Admittedly, I\u2019m a sucker for archery combat in games, but it really doesn\u2019t get much better than unleashing arrow after arrow into the glowing weak point of a metal menace. It also really brings out the best of the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense, which lets you feel the bowstring tighten on your trigger finger before the recoil cascades through your controller. The machines themselves are exquisitely designed, each bringing their own bag of party tricks to the West. The hippo-like Widemaw that pulls you in with its vacuum mouth before spitting boulders at you is a considerable threat early on, so there\u2019s something extra satisfying about being able to one-shot one with a well-placed projectile between its metal teeth as you grow more powerful. The speed and power with which the machines move is a sight to behold \u2013 not that you\u2019ll have much time to stop and stare as they barrel towards you. But if you allow yourself to slip into slow motion for a moment you\u2019ll be able to see each gear ticking within their gaping jaws before you need to dodge out of the way of death.

Zero Dawn cranked up the difficulty near the end of its story, and it's not too different here either. There are a few particularly challenging machine types that you have no option but to take head-on, demanding you have full confidence in your chosen playstyle. Performance Review: PS5 vs PS4 Pro vs PS4 Horizon Forbidden West had a huge weight of expectation laid upon it, yet the results manage to exceed all expectations. Its visuals, even on a base PS4, are cutting edge with a dense and dynamic world, vibrant colors, impeccable performance, and interactions that will leave you aghast at times thanks to the quality achieved. The PS4 Pro is even more impressive, with a higher level of detail, resolution, and overall quality. It already feels and performs like the premium package that all Pro owners will be ecstatic with from beginning to end. Achieving closer quality with the PS5 in performance mode. Of course, the PS5 manages to straddle that line between refined and enhanced perfectly. The 4K 30fps mode secures pixel perfection with a pin sharp and CGI-like delivery that displays the very best Guerrilla Games has to offer (as yet anyway). Meanwhile, the Performance mode enhances the already glorious PS4 Pro version with enhancements to its level of detail, post-processing effect improvements, and twice the performance. That still makes the PS5 the clear choice if you happen to own one of these elusive consoles. That said, the PS4 and PS4 Pro offer up an incredible package all the same, and it\u2019s awe inspiring they pulled off such a technical feat at the end of the generation. Read the full Horizon Forbidden West Performance Review Aloy\u2019s skill trees are extensive and allow you to tailor exactly how you want to play, certainly offering a far more extensive menu to choose from than the original. Out of the six different columns available I put a lot of my points into the Hunter branch in order to maximise my bow skills and increase the effects of the concentration ability which allows you to slow down time. This also unlocked some handy secondary-fire abilities for my bow, such as being able to send a high arching volley of arrows onto a target for increased damage. Valor surges are special abilities unlocked on each skill tree that can be triggered intermittently throughout combat to really turn the tables in a fight \u2013 for example, one of the stealth surges harnesses Stalker machine technology to temporarily grant you a cloaking device, making it easy to ambush unsuspecting enemies. Aloy\u2019s skill trees are extensive and allow you to tailor exactly how you want to play. \u201c Combat encounters vary from fight to fight and eventually demand you display all of the skills at Aloy's disposal as bigger and bigger threats are thrown at you. It\u2019s a great exercise in thinking on your feet and consistently provides excellent moment-to-moment gameplay. One huge contributing factor to this variety is the sheer amount of different enemy types in the Forbidden West. It\u2019s not just in the range of machines on show, but also in the humans determined to stop you. Fighting packs of humans is entirely more dynamic in Forbidden West as you scramble around architecture and vegetation and in and out of stealth. It definitely feels like Aloy has ripped a page out of Ellie's journal here where it comes to how to handle these encounters. There's a fantastic weight to melee combat, which feels like a much more viable and \u2013 crucially \u2013 fun option this time around for Aloy. Swings of the spear crunch into enemies and unlockable combos add extra depth. These come in handy, especially against the energy shield-wielding rebel champions. In general, Aloy feels great to control in combat, light on her feet but heavy-hitting. All until you find yourself caught between a Rockbreaker and a hard place, that is. While not going so far as to adopt the \"climb anything\" approach of more Bokoblin-littered open-world games, there's a greater sense of freedom thanks to your new pulse's ability to scan for handholds on cliffs, and there\u2019s usually a path to reach wherever you\u2019d like to go. Although it\u2019s undoubtedly an improvement on Zero Dawn, I did sometimes feel penned in by a world enveloped by mountains. It's in combat where this is often highlighted, when I\u2019d feel myself scrambling around looking for a handhold to climb a four-foot wall that Aloy really should be able to vault over without even needing one. Unfortunately, this activity often ends in an untidy death at the hands of a trampling machine. It does feel a bit archaic to be restricted to predetermined handhold routes when we're used to much more freeform climbing in 2022. It does feel a bit archaic to be restricted to predetermined climbing routes. \u201c Similarly, while you can now grapple yourself to objects using the Pullcaster, don't think of this as being a game-changer on the level of Halo Infinite's Grappleshot or Just Cause\u2019s grappling hook before it. In Forbidden West it's much more of a puzzle and combat tool used for getting out of sticky situations than it is something that will help you zip around its world. That being said, most of my quibbles with the climbing were quickly forgotten once a liberating new ability (which I won\u2019t spoil) is introduced later on and makes moving around the map a much more exciting proposition. It comes as a great relief too, as it\u2019s a world I wanted to spend a considerable time exploring. Freedom A rapturous harmony of beautiful natural landscapes and fearsome machines, Horizon Forbidden West is one of, if not the most visually impressive game I've ever played \u2013 even when playing on performance mode, which offers a smooth 60fps at the cost of some level of detail \u2013 a tradeoff which I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend due to the fact that it still looks fantastic. From tiny touches like individual blades of scarlet grass to awe-inducing landscapes that sweep the horizon, it\u2019s an astonishingly detailed world. There\u2019s verdant jungle, sweeping desert, snowy peaks, waves crashing like liquid crystal against sand\u2026 the list goes on. Seriously, though, sometimes the only thought that crossed my mind was \"f**k me, have you seen the look of this?!\" Forbidden West takes the time to ease you into its vast world. After a slightly pedestrian and linear tutorial section, it kicks into life and sets you free. It\u2019s clear from early on that Guerrilla has spent a lot more time creating a more interesting open world this time around and nowhere is this clearer than in its settlements, which are universally a vast improvement over Zero Dawn\u2019s comparatively lifeless equivalents. These range from small villages made up of huts and traders to large towns, each with their own quirks. My favourites are those that make homes of old-world architecture \u2013 Plainsong, for example, is a commune repurposing a series of nature-reclaimed satellite dishes. There are many to discover, each beautifully unique, including one particular enrapturing underground location that's home to one of the most visually striking video game levels in recent memory (and I won't dare spoil it). In general, the Forbidden West is littered with physical echoes of past humanity, making for a rich and visually compelling sandbox that almost serves as a museum to the history we\u2019re living in now. It isn't just the environment, but the attention to detail placed in the humans. Each tribe is distinct from one another and the costume design on show is astounding. Aside from being places to stock up on resources and acquire new weapons and armor from merchants, these clusters of civilization are where a lot of side missions will begin. This is probably the biggest area of improvement for Forbidden West when compared to its predecessor, which had very limited and repetitive optional content. These clusters of civilization are probably the biggest area of improvement for Forbidden West. \u201c Side quests are infinitely more engaging and pretty lengthy, too \u2013 they\u2019re not just throwaway requests from nameless wanderers but instead are smartly woven into the main story. Some will involve characters you\u2019ll meet along the main plot asking more personal requests of you, while others will be completely new faces asking you to help out with social issues, such as helping depose a town\u2019s unlikeable leader from his position of power. These side stories only enrich the experience, and while you may not have many active choices to make that influence their outcome, I really did feel like I was changing the world around me as I made my way through it. In that respect, it\u2019s quite easy to be reminded of The Witcher 3 in the way it approaches its secondary missions: you\u2019re not only all but guaranteed a fun time but also very likely to find satisfying stories and unique pieces of gear for your troubles.  For example, one treasure hunt-like quest had me diving into caves and digging through shipwrecks in order to find an ancient piece of technology that I could repurpose into a unique type of tripcaster (the tripwire deploying weapon from the original) that deploys shields instead of the standard traps. A good portion of the side quests and people you meet along the way also help shine some light when compared to the relevant dark themes of the main story. There's a great levity to the writing, which manages to flow seamlessly between talk of world-ending events to witty one-liners. The different quirky characters met and distinctive rewards received from each side quest means that they very rarely feel repetitive. It's a real credit that, in a world so dense with objective markers, very few (if any) feel like rinse-and-repeat jobs. Yes, some missions are just glorified fetch quests (true of virtually every game ever), but when the parts you're fetching are the antlers of a fire-breathing metal antelope, there\u2019s rarely a dull moment. Outside of side quests, there\u2019s a long list of other activities available: rebel camps to clear out, different types of collectibles to find, arenas to test your might in, and of course, scaleable Tallnecks, the giraffe-like recon giants. Cauldrons also return from Zero Dawn, and these challenging dungeons that are carved into mountain sides grant you the ability to override machines \u2019 will and make them fight for you. A particular favourite of mine are the new Relic Ruins , which are fun little puzzle boxes hidden around the world that put all of your mental tools to the test. Some of which take a considerable time to solve, as if bitesize chunks of Tomb Raider have been transplanted into a far-flung future. A particular favourite of mine are the new Relic Ruins. \u201c That Witcher 3 influence even extends to the minigame Machine Strike , a strategy board game that contains all the addictive qualities of Gwent or Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Orlog. It\u2019s impressively deep and there are many, many people in the world to go up against, all with their own boards, pieces, and playstyles. It not only begs to be played for hours on end but also encourages exploration in order to find new machine miniatures to add to your collection. The Best PS5 Games 26 Images The action isn\u2019t just restricted to the many, many objective icons on the map though \u2013 aimless wandering is rewarded with random events taking place across the world, which gives a sense of real discovery. These range from fighting off some rebels who have prepared an ambush by a rocky path to rescuing a family from a herd of aggressive machines, and many more. Occasions like this further build on a feeling of genuine causality to your actions in the world too, as you\u2019ll bump into the same people later at a settlement who will thank Aloy for playing the role of hero. On top of all of this, there's just so much to see and do that I don't want to spoil in any way. Characters, creatures, and locations that I wouldn't want the joy and surprise that I experienced discovering taken away from others. For large swaths of it, the Forbidden West really is a place that needs to be seen to be believed. Where to Buy Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition - PC 0 $59.99 at Humble"

        "Content": "As I sit perched atop my throne and welcome another throng of unwashed petitioners to track mud across my brand-new Persian carpet, surely bringing with them all manner of trivial frustrations to waste my time, one thought sits at the front of my mind: where has this been all my life? Royal Court is the first major expansion for Crusader Kings 3 , and between a full 3D throne room that puts you in the world, to the return of the inventory system from Crusader Kings 2 , to wonderfully customizable cultures, everything feels like it was meant to be here all along. While the base game of Crusader Kings 3 was already a masterpiece, it's remarkable how incomplete it would feel to go back to it after playing Royal Court. Some recent expansions to Paradox's older games, like Europa Universalis IV , have seemed like the devs are just looking for stuff to do at this point. But not Royal Court, which is full of new features which add more personal involvement and an empowering level of control over how your society functions. It\u2019s a bit painful that you can\u2019t access most of it when playing as a duke or a tribal ruler, which had previously been two of my favorite types of characters and seem like a perfect fit for the kind of intimate, less expansion-focused playstyle having your own court allows. But the intrigue and excitement of the court itself are too good to pass up. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Paradox games have been jokingly called \"map-staring games\" because of the amount of time you spend gazing at your empire from miles in the sky, so this zoomed-in view of a single room is a big departure: leaders that rank as kings and above of feudal and clan societies now preside over a full 3D court that takes one of four distinct styles, depending on what region you're playing in. The somewhat Spartan but cozy Western European, airy and bright Mediterranean, lavish Middle Eastern, or ornate Indian aesthetics all look fantastic. The level of detail on the architecture and textures is impressive, though moving between camera angles still chugs even on my fairly beefy PC, and there are no dynamic shadows for characters, which seems a little odd in 2022. Still, it's up there with Stellaris ' epic space battles for the most visually impressive a Paradox game has ever been. The level of detail on the architecture and textures is impressive. \u201c Maintaining a court means keeping up with grandeur, a new stat representing how absolutely lit life at your court is. Hiring flavorful and period-appropriate new positions like a Court Poet or increasing your spending on servants and fashion raise grandeur, and it's not all just for bragging rights. The bigger your realm is, the more grandeur you're expected to have, with penalties to your prestige if you fall behind. This serves as a smart check on very large empires, since having to balance the court budget against your army and infrastructure soaks up enough excess resources to help with some of CK3's late-game snowballing problems. Is Crusader Kings 3 more of a strategy game or an RPG at this point? Strategy game RPG Answer See Results Hearing petitions and making decisions, like which town to favor in a bitter rivalry between two mayors, adds a lot of new and welcome story generation. It's especially nice during moments when you don't have any wars or backroom schemes going on, and breaks up long periods of waiting for a claim to be fabricated or anything else that could previously slow a campaign down. My biggest critique is that hearing petitions always locks you into a camera angle looking down on the proceedings from on high, which feels too static and doesn't let me look my subjects in the eye when I tell them, \u201cThis sounds like a you problem.\u201d But it's great to feel like I'm making a difference in the lives of the average people living in my kingdom nonetheless. It's awesome to take your empire to war with a spear that's been in your family since the Viking Age. \u201c Just having a physical place in the world my characters can hang out in leans into the RPG aspects of Crusader Kings 3 \u2013 which is where it really shines. And bringing back the inventory system, first introduced in Crusader Kings 2's Monks and Mystics expansion, delightfully furthers the sense that I'm playing a character and not an abstract idea of a country. Forging a family weapon that I can hand down for a dozen generations creates a strong sense of continuity across a playthrough that can take hundreds of years and put you in the shoes of a dozen different monarchs. It's purely awesome to take your late-medieval empire to war with a spear that's been in your family since the Viking Age. Crusader Kings 3: Royal Court Screenshots 15 Images What We Said About Crusader Kings 3 Crusader Kings 3 is a superb strategy game, a great RPG, and a master class in how to take the best parts of existing systems and make them deeper and better. I have thousands of hours in the previous game, and I expect to spend at least that many in this third installment. All of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love, war, triumph, and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my playthroughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary. In fact, if I had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life, the decision wouldn\u2019t be that difficult. A new king of historical strategy has been crowned.

CK3 launched with an excellent custom religion system that allowed you to create your own heresy, selecting everything from the bonuses it gives practitioners to its teachings on, for example, homosexuality or witchcraft. Now, we can do the same thing with our entire culture as well. As the head of an existing culture you can swap out or add pillars, from adopting Roman-style standing armies to becoming horse nomads who completely ignore attrition on the windswept steppes. If you're not the culture head you can choose to diverge from your parent culture, and if you have more than one prominent culture in your realm you can create a hybrid culture of the two. It always felt disappointing before when I would lead my viking armies to conquer part of India, but I couldn't combine aspects of both the conquerors and the conquered, as often happened in actual history. Now I can! And if I'm not feeling like going on some grand outing to found new kingdoms and give rise to new cultures, I can pay someone else to do it for me. Inspired characters now show up at court to ask for funding to go on thrilling adventures to far-flung corners of the world, and these kick off some of my favorite event chains in all of CK3. As they evaded bandits, hunted wild beasts, and discovered legendary relics, I looked forward to every thrilling dispatch from my adventurers. One of them even brought me back Excalibur!

Its stylised art, intense level design, and challenging trick system all helped it stand out. Seven years later, OlliOlli World has all those things going for it, too, but it also takes a huge step forward for the series by shifting into 3D, giving its skating a better sense of scale, speed, and dynamism without sacrificing the 2D perspective. At the same time, it builds significantly on Olliwood's technical gameplay by layering grabs, wall rides, and more atop the flip tricks, grinds, and manuals that were its foundation. And on top of all that, it goes out of its way to be more welcoming to players of all stripes, putting forth a host of changes that ensure just about anyone can have a good time without losing the fiercely high skill ceiling the series is known for. OlliOlli World's colourful, cartoony look and character-centric approach is the first thing that had me saying \"ooo\" \u2013 not just because it\u2019s very pretty in its own right, but because it\u2019s also  very reminiscent of one of my favourite cartoon locations, Adventure Time's Kingdom of Ooo. Whether we're talking about your character's skate wizard guide Chiffon, the ice cream-headed denizens of Sunshine Valley, the smiling trees of Cloverbrook, or the many \u201cSkate Godz\u201d that you're tricking across Radlandia to meet, there are too many homages to miss the inspiration. It\u2019s also similar in its effervescent and eccentric personality but thankfully doesn\u2019t feel derivative, striking out on its own with a world populated by endearingly offbeat characters and a story that doesn't take itself seriously, yet is enjoyably earnest at the same time. That board would be ideal for shove(l) its. I'll see myself out. The approach certainly works for me, and the insane level of character customisation available helped me realise my own oddball character to add to the world. The breadth of options here is truly impressive, letting you adjust everything from your physique and clothes to (almost) every component of your skateboard and even some of your animations. The potential for unique creations is on display in a bunch of other ways as well, from seeing your friends on the loading screens to the rival system, which challenges you to beat other players' on each level... and even inserts that player's avatar into the pre-level dialogue to put a face to the name. (That's the character on the right in the screenshot below.) I see your moustache is as needlessly elaborate as mine... Oh, and how's this for an instant win for the character customisation system: You can try on any article of clothing and then revert back to what you were wearing before with the press of a button. No searching for the item to re-equip it again if you realise you made a mistake. Adding the equivalent of CTRL-Z to a character editor is so sensible it's almost painful, and makes testing out new looks a breeze. It's once you start skating, however, that the new presentation really starts to pop. The OlliOlli games have always felt fast and responsive, but World cranks this right up, running at a silky 60fps on PC, with super smooth character animations and a number of dynamic elements. Courses are full of absolutely thrilling sequences, whether that's flying along an undulating networks of rails, holding long, lazy wallrides where the camera pulls way back to show the impossible scale of the trick, or launching at speed out of a grind to fly low over an arching factory rooftop and seamlessly into another grind. Levels are no longer just left to right affairs but sweep back and forth, utilising quarter pipes and complex switchbacks. The terrain can be dense with paths to take and planes to skate on, even looping back around to where you started via \u201cgnarly routes\u201d. And it\u2019s all set to a funky, laidback electronic soundtrack that helps make the skating feel even cooler. Levels are no longer just left to right affairs but sweep back and forth, utilising quarter pipes and complex switchbacks. \u201c One minor additional note on the course design: while all the levels proper are fantastic, some of the side quests \u2013 like popping balloons or rotating in the air \u2013 are rather unexciting, which makes finding the characters that host these challenges less rewarding than it could have been. On the plus side, one side quest does see you try and outrace a bear riding an inflatable tube down a river, so that\u2019s definitely a win. Who is the most influential skater of all time?

You're no longer just grinding, flip tricking, and spinning \u2013 with manuals joining them together, but also wall-riding, pulling and tweaking grabs, fitting in late tricks, and even negotiating stairs via firecrackers (so-called because of the rapid-fire bangs as you clack down each step). The latter is a low-key game-changer, as landing in a manual on a set of stairs flies in the face of everything I\u2019ve learnt in skating games over the years, and makes extending combos via stair sets even more delicious than it might otherwise have been. And all these tricks are merely an analogue stick movement or button-press away. In OlliOlli World you can skate the way you want to skate. \u201c Hearing them described, it\u2019s easy to imagine how OlliOlli World's mechanics could feel completely overwhelming. And yet, while it\u2019s absolutely crammed with things to learn, it takes a very relaxed approach to introducing them all, with tutorials peppered steadily throughout the relatively modest campaign. It's not until the last of the five main areas, for instance, that you learn about late tricks and grind switching, and the gradual pace allows you to get used to each new addition as you incorporate them into your flow. Or not. Things like late tricks and the more advanced flip tricks and grinds are very much optional. In OlliOlli World you can skate the way you want to skate. OlliOlliWorld Review Screenshots 8 Images By and large the controls do a fantastic job of putting a lot of options within easy reach, and I almost always felt that errors were my own fault \u2013 either bungling an input, not having enough momentum, or getting the timing on something wrong. That said, I had a few minor issues with wall rides \u2013 especially on moving walls \u2013 that felt a little outside my control, while the grind switching system occasionally had me ollying into a flip trick instead of shifting to a new grind. That could cause some small frustration here and there, but never enough to distract me for long. On that note, OlliOlli World is a far more forgiving game than its predecessors. If you're holding the left analogue stick in preparation for a flip trick, for instance, you can still push with your foot to build speed. There's no penalty for setting yourself too early. And if you're rotating in the air and land side on, you won't crash \u2013 you'll just get less points than if you completed the rotation and landed perfectly. You can even land side on in a manual and continue your combo... well, aside from on stairs, where you do actually have to land facing forwards or backwards. In general though, OlliOlli World isn't interested in punishing your mistakes, it's focused on rewarding your execution. OlliOlli World isn't interested in punishing your mistakes, it's focused on rewarding your execution. \u201c And if you do bail it\u2019s not as painful as it looks, because getting back up and skating again is instantaneous. A tap of a button will reset you back to the last checkpoint, while holding it for a second starts the whole run again. The checkpoint system itself takes a little getting used to though, as these spots aren\u2019t just valuable for restarts but for banking points too, lest you lose them all through an overambitious combo. Once you\u2019re bearing that in mind, there's very little friction in trying sections over and over. Well, aside from the friction of your virtual face repeatedly slamming into a virtual wall. What We Said About OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood There\u2019s essentially no limit to how good you can get at OlliOlli 2. Just when you\u2019ve mastered beating levels in a single combo and timing every single grind and manual perfectly, there are a host of other mechanics to integrate into your skating to bump that high score even further skyward. Why land in a boring old manual when you could revert into it? Why do a standard trick or grind when you could add a rotation or pull off something more complex with a longer \u2013 and riskier - animation? And hey, are you grind switching on every rail you can? It\u2019s an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect. - Cam Shea, March 3, 2015 Score: 9 Read the full OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood Review Flexistentialism Given OlliOlli World is designed to be welcoming to players of all skill levels, just about anyone will be able to see everything Radlandia has to offer. Completing a level, after all, simply means getting to the end, not posting a particular score. This also means that there's a good chance that after you've played through everything you've really only taken your first step down the path towards becoming a true skate god. I'd only scratched the surface of all the challenges when I beat the final level, for instance, and it was truly satisfying going back to the beginning with a fuller understanding of the mechanics and thrashing my previous high scores, as well as beating the score challenges on every level... well, almost every level. Some of the numbers towards the end get pretty insane. Not pictured: the high scores I haven't beaten yet. In fact, to beat those late-game scores the only option is to complete each level in one combo, and even then it's easy to fall short. You may need to take all the alternate (and hardest) paths, incorporate the most difficult tricks and concentrate on timing each grind and manual perfectly to get there. OlliOlli World may not be hard to \u201ccomplete,\u201d but it\u2019s excellent that there are punishingly difficult goals waiting for those who want to attempt them once they do. To beat the late-game score challenges the only option is to complete each level in one combo, and even then it's easy to fall short. \u201c On top of chasing scores, each level also has three bespoke challenges from one of your travelling companions, the somewhat simple-minded magazine editor, Mike, and these incorporate collectables, alternate routes, specific trick spots, and more. Beating the game brings additional unlocks too, including two new modes. These are an online league system that sees skaters around the world vie for high scores on a daily leaderboard, as well as a basic but powerful random level generator that\u2019s perfect for testing your skills in each of the main areas and sharing cool challenges with friends."

We\u2019re a few hours into Final Fantasy XIV's latest expansion, Endwalker. \"Has it been worthwhile?\" My character never really gets to answer, and many hours later, I think that's because Square Enix also directs the question to us as players: Have the last eight years of FFXIV and all those hundreds of cutscenes been worth the time? I wish I had had the chance to say so, because after Endwalker, my answer is an unequivocal \u201cyes.\u201d Parts of this roughly 50-hour story move a little slower than I'd have liked, but when so many games, TV shows, and movie series seem incapable of delivering a satisfactory ending, it's refreshing to see one that mostly manages to stick the landing to an arc that\u2019s gone on for so long. For that matter, Endwalker is good enough that it removes any doubt that this reborn MMORPG deserves inclusion in any discussion of the best Final Fantasy stories ever written. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That's partly because FFXIV is now a complete tale, with this expansion marking its end to what its 2013 reboot began. Endwalker wraps up virtually every major plotline introduced within that time frame, ranging from the long struggle between the semi-deities Hydaelyn and Zodiark and the ambitions of the Ascians to the fate of the Garlean Empire. Even the new zones suggest a desire to be done with whatever came before; in Endwalker, some of the spots I visited included the South Asia-inspired island nation of Thavnair, the scholarly city-state of Sharlayan, and Garlemald itself \u2013 as though Square Enix were trying to scratch off all the places that have long been mentioned but never visited. FFXIV is now a complete tale, with this expansion marking its end to what its 2013 reboot began. \u201c Anything that comes after this will be something entirely different. That's likely a good thing, as 2019's phenomenal Shadowbringers expansion showed what wonders FFXIV is capable of when it almost leaves this familiar world behind altogether. Both Shadowbringers and Endwalker remind us that much of the appeal of FFXIV's story lies not so much in the world itself, but in you and your companions, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Every major character gets his or her moment in the spotlight here as they rush to figure out how to destroy foreboding, H.H. Giger-esque towers that are meant to bring about the end of the world. Their adventure kicks off with an attempt to find some answers in the libraries of Sharlayan and then a jaunt to Thavnair to try to tackle one of the towers yourself. As virtually all the marketing makes clear, these exploits eventually land you on the surface of the moon. But here's one of the cool things about Endwalker: the moon isn't even the craziest of the places you'll visit. Who is Final Fantasy XIV's best villain? Zenos yae Galvus Lahabrea Emet-Selch Nidhogg Gilgamesh Yotsuyu goe Brutus King Thordan Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results I won't, of course, say why you go to the moon, but it's only one of the ways in which writer Natsuko Ishikawa successfully subverts our expectations for what many of us were expecting from this years-old story. To say more is to leap into a minefield of spoilers, so let's put it this way: Endwalker may ultimately be the end of FFXIV's main story, but it's better understood as a direct companion piece to Shadowbringers. Shadowbringers is a deeply personal story that explores motivations, while Endwalker zooms out to tie up loose ends and show us how our actions affect the world at large. If Shadowbringers is Avengers: Infinity War , then Endwalker is Avengers: Endgame . Even so, Endwalker brims with emotionally stirring moments and spends much time with an endlessly endearing pair of characters I could\u2019ve spent an entire game with. Yet it also delves into the dark side of ending every conflict when you're the world's greatest hero. Plenty of rousing speeches and occasional anime silliness pepper the journey to the new level cap of 90, but Endwalker doesn't shy from depictions of people whose distrust resists all attempts at compassion, or those whose pride keeps them from living with defeat. If Shadowbringers is Avengers: Infinity War, then Endwalker is Avengers: Endgame. \u201c It's strongest in these intimate moments, centered as they are on the personal consequences of war rather than struggles between titans. Along the same lines, Endwalker does a better job than any other expansion of showing that the bonds between the Scions go much deeper than work buddies, even if my cynical half can't help but find some moments unrealistically optimistic when compared to the real world. The struggles with the villains initially struck me as somewhat weaker, but I find they hold up better under introspection, particularly after looking up certain names and finding hints of inspiration in Greek myth. Endwalker answers many of the questions Shadowbringers left unanswered, and in the process makes the previous expansion even more remarkable. Don't Skip Just make sure you're comfortable. Almost all that story is told through cutscenes that often last 15 minutes or more, and watching them all takes more time than watching a few seasons of some popular TV shows. Miraculously, most of these cutscenes feel essential, as skipping one (which you\u2019re allowed to do) usually leads to missing a key plot point or winding up in some crazy spot with no idea of how you got there. In the best ones, I would have stood up and cheered if I were in a theater. The only ones that tend to drag are the ones with Return of the King-style moments where you meet and greet with seemingly the entire cast. Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review 94 Images When you do need to fight, Endwalker usually gives you legitimate reasons rather than concocting ridiculous scenarios to justify killing 10 sheep or whatever in the style of many other MMORPGs (and early FFXIV itself). But Endwalker prefers to sprinkle its leveling journey with quests where no fighting happens at all. Some are better than others \u2013 lore nerds like me will relish those where NPCs follow you and offer optional chats at specific points. Less successful are the several stealth missions requiring you to trail NPCs without being noticed and end if your quarry spots you \u2013 no one liked those missions in early Assassin\u2019s Creed games and they\u2019re no better here. The most maddening quest in Endwalker, though, simply makes you walk around a village and find people to talk to. It sounds basic, but they\u2019re annoyingly well hidden and I probably spent half an hour trying to track everyone down. Fortunately, these moments are mere blips in Endwalker's epic running time, and the story usually cleanses the palete with an awe-inspiring reveal or emotional moment. Even the hated village quest is quickly followed by a tearjerker cutscene that closes an arc left untouched since A Realm Reborn. Even the hated village quest is quickly followed by a tearjerker cutscene that closes an arc left untouched since A Realm Reborn. \u201c Such moments remind me, again, that Final Fantasy XIV is already eight years old (not counting the original disastrous launch), and if I look around, I can see in the distant textures that it's starting to show its age a bit. But Square Enix\u2019s MMORPG serves as a reminder that good art direction and sound design sometimes outdo games that need a mythical GeForce RTX 3090 to run properly. The last two zones in Endwalker are visual wonders, and one scene in particular drives home the power of Masayoshi Soken's excellent and ever-present soundtrack by taking it away. The music stops. No animals make noise. And by stripping FFXIV of most NPCs and music at that moment, Square Enix reminds us how much it does with aging resources. Screens  -  Final Fantasy XIV Online Endwalker 9 Images Final Fantasy XIV doesn't allow that sad moment to linger for long, though, and in doing so, it reminds me of an inescapable weak point in the story. We all go into Endwalker facing the end of all things, but I already knew that once I was done with the story, I'd be free to craft at my leisure in Sharlayan's plazas, join hundreds of players on boss hunts through the new zones, and participate in the new raids. Ever present in the back corners of my mind, this knowledge robbed Endwalker's tale of some of its tension. What We Said About Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers Shadowbringers weaves such a beautiful tale that it's tough not to gush about each and every strand of it individually. There might be some awkward job balancing changes here and there, but the fumbles are never enough to take away from how magnificent this expansion is as a whole. I arrived a stranger in Norvrandt, but I left as one of their own as even the simplest quests drew me in and made me truly care about the story being told there. Shadowbringers has only further solidified XIV's status as one of the greatest Final Fantasy games ever made. - Kyle Campbell, July 12, 2019 Score: 9.5 Read the full Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers Review Reaping the benefits But that free time also leaves room to level the new Reaper and Sage jobs that start at level 70 (and unlock once you have another combat job at 70). Armed as it is with a scythe and clad in gothy cloaks, the Reaper is one of the best additions to FFXIV's DPS roster in years. Its ability rotation is shockingly simple, but so far swooshing my scythe to fill up a bar that lets me summon a wraith that boosts my damage remains endlessly exciting. It's a little too edgy for my tastes, but even so I'm having so much fun with it that it'll be the next job I level to cap. The Reaper is one of the best additions to FFXIV's DPS roster in years. \u201c As if offering a counterpoint, Sage presents a far greater challenge, as it's partly designed around shielding allies and healing your tank by dealing damage to foes. I still don't really have the hang of it, but I like how it combines the best parts of Scholar and White Mage into a package that more experienced healers are clearly enjoying. Seeing a talented Sage in action in dungeons is a sight to behold, and I look forward to attaining even a fraction of that skill. Beyond that, though, Endwalker doesn't do much if anything to shake up the established rhythms of gameplay with new elements. The bosses for trials and dungeons are some of the best I\u2019ve ever fought in Final Fantasy XIV, but the dungeons themselves still involve little more than jogging down an (often visually striking) corridor from one boss to the next. Dungeon design is one of the few things I believe World of Warcraft still does better than its ever-rising competitor, and considering some of the wild places Endwalker takes us, I'm surprised there wasn't more creativity in level design. The good news is that Final Fantasy XIV does much to make up for the absence of new features by stuffing Endwalker with quality of life improvements. At last, a minimap now pops up when accessing a city\u2019s fast-travel network, eliminating the need to memorize the name of the crystal you need to port to. Gathering jobs are simpler: High-quality gathered materials no longer exist \u2013 recipes now emphasize quantity instead \u2013 and the pile of abilities needed to make collectibles has been replaced by a fairly intuitive minigame. Even combat classes got some love, and revisions are generally for the better. Summoner went from being one of the most complex DPS jobs to one of the simplest, and without losing the flow and godly damage that made it so appealing in the first place. Elsewhere, my Samurai's rotation for area-of-effect abilities has been simplified, so I don't have to waste time putting up single-target damage debuffs to get the most out of my damage. Final Fantasy XIV Wins IGN's Best Ongong Game of 2021 Endwalker's story hits hardest when you've been with its characters from the beginning, watching people like Alphinaud and Alisaie mature from spoiled brats to wise leaders or learning the contexts for all the folks you'll meet in some key cutscenes. (Alas, there\u2019s no sign of Hildibrand Manderville.) What worries me, though, is that the barrier to access this part of this story for new players is now so high that, well, it practically reaches the moon. Endwalker's story alone takes around 45 to 50 hours to finish at the minimum if you watch all the cutscenes. To reach that, though, you also have to work your way through the hundreds of hours of story in A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Shadowbringers. I like to think it's worth playing through all that without paying for a story boost, but then I've been playing this game for the better part of a decade and wouldn\u2019t have time to play through it in essentially one go if I were to start today. Clearly this isn't deterring too many people, though, considering that Final Fantasy XIV is currently so popular that would-be new players can't even buy it . But a part of me hopes that all these resolved plot lines and definitive endings pave the way for an easier entry into the series for new players in the upcoming expansion. And whatever is on the horizon, I look forward to seeing it."

There\u2019s a lot to do in this expansive playground, and completing its never-dull-or-overwhelming list of activities earns more combat options and, ultimately, more fun.

Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images But, in the grand tradition of Grand Theft Auto 3 , you can\u2019t go everywhere straight off the bat. Instead, Zeta Halo unlocks section by section, with key story missions opening up new lands to explore \u2013 though I do wish those new lands had a bit more variety. Or really, any variety at all. There\u2019s no snowy area like in Combat Evolved, no urban area like in Halo 2 (or in Infinite\u2019s own multiplayer maps like Streets and Bazaar, for that matter), or really\u2026 anything other than the mix of forest and stone monoliths. It\u2019s as if 343 didn\u2019t take its artistic inspiration from the whole of Halo 1, it took it specifically from \u201cThe Silent Cartographer\u201d and nowhere else.

It\u2019s as if 343 took inspiration specifically from \u201cThe Silent Cartographer\u201d and nowhere else. \u201c On a related note, I also wish Zeta Halo was a bit prettier. Halo games, like many major first-party efforts, have often been graphical showcases for their respective consoles \u2013 including 343\u2019s own Halo 4, which elicited a late-in-the-generation \u201cHow did they do this on the 360?\u201d kind of reaction to its gorgeous graphics back in 2012. While Infinite\u2019s indoor spaces did wow me at times and there are certainly some impressive vistas across its outdoor landscape, Infinite looks perfectly good at best, but not jaw-droppingly so as Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 4 did before it. \u201cHey Cortana, What the Hell Is Going on in Halo?\u201d Speaking of previous Halo games, the only concern I had heading into Halo Infinite that I really had to worry about was the story. Halo 4 certainly has its issues, but its focus on Master Chief\u2019s relationship with a Cortana who was rapidly succumbing to rampancy gave it a memorable and commendable emotional core. Halo 5 , unfortunately, followed up by derailing any momentum that 4 had built by, among other narrative crimes, barely letting you play as Master Chief. It dug a deep hole for Halo Infinite to try and climb out of \u2013 particularly given that Infinite tries to both tie up 5\u2019s loose ends and keep the existing storyline going, while also serving as the aforementioned \u201cspiritual reboot\u201d meant to welcome in new fans. In the end, it\u2019s too tall a task. What We Thought About Halo Infinite's Multiplayer It\u2019s so nice when a game actually lives up to sky-high expectations! Halo Infinite has been one of the most anticipated games out there since it was first announced three years ago, and for its multiplayer component to so fully deliver on the series\u2019 classic feel while also keeping up with the modern-day competition in the FPS genre is a huge achievement. With some fantastic map design, a collection of straightforward but highly engaging modes for both large and small groups, excellent weapons and gear options, and those delightfully bouncy and sticky grenades, Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer modes put it in the top tier of competitive shooters. Impressively, it manages to give nostalgic veterans the best of what they remember Halo multiplayer feeling like while also smoothly introducing new players to the joys of Spartan combat. - Stella Chung, November 24, 2021 Score: 9 Read the full Halo Infinite Multiplayer Review It\u2019s not a Halo 5-level disaster by any stretch \u2013 for starters, Infinite doesn\u2019t waste time with any playable characters who aren\u2019t Master Chief \u2013 but it probably isn\u2019t going to really make most players happy. Its tale focuses on the splinter Covenant faction The Banished (last seen in Halo Wars 2 ) and was not particularly satisfying for this longtime Halo fan, and the new players Infinite is hoping to bring in might be outright lost. If you\u2019re in the latter group, you\u2019re going to ask the following questions (and plenty of others) that Infinite never answers: Who are the Covenant? Why is Cortana evil? What are the Guardians? None of that old ground is covered. Infinite doesn\u2019t waste time with any playable characters who aren\u2019t Master Chief. \u201c And even if, like me, you\u2019ve played every Halo campaign multiple times, the fact is that it\u2019s been six years and the last one was the most convoluted Halo story ever means that it\u2019s not easy to get comfortable with Infinite\u2019s plot. This sixth Halo should\u2019ve come with a \u201cHalo\u2019s Story So Far\u201d cinematic that rolls before you start playing, as we\u2019ve seen other long-running series do (most recently, Microsoft\u2019s own Psychonauts 2 ). Maybe 343 ran out of time or maybe it never came up, but it\u2019s a failure that could\u2019ve been avoided. Still, there are really good aspects of the story too: namely, the relationship between Master Chief and his new AI companion, who we only know as The Weapon. She is voiced by Jen Taylor, who also stars as Cortana as well as Spartan program creator Dr. Catherine Halsey. You don\u2019t need to be a hardcore Halo fan to recognize Taylor\u2019s nuanced performances in playing three similar but distinct roles; she effortlessly separates the three, playing brilliantly off of the fact that The Weapon doesn\u2019t know the Chief at all (though that makes it even stranger that basic Halo concepts aren\u2019t spelled out for new players by using her as their proxy). We get to watch their partnership be born, then strain, and later strengthen. They get sarcastic with each other, they argue, and they build an unsteady alliance. Steve Downes, meanwhile, is fantastic in his sixth turn as Master Chief, who psychologically struggles through Infinite as an emotionally broken and lost man who blames himself for the sad state of humanity \u2013 the details of which are made painfully clear over the course of the campaign. I truly hope 343 never recasts either of these two wonderful voice actors. Combat Evolved Getting back to gameplay, the FOBs are the real key to everything in Infinite\u2019s open world. Recapture them and your map will populate with many of the aforementioned activities, along with other notable map icons like Spartan Core locations \u2013 the bounties of which allow you to upgrade your equipment in ways that let you tailor your playstyle. I pumped all of my points into the Shield Core at first, which made the bit of extra punishment that Heroic difficulty doles out feel plenty manageable. (If you\u2019re going to tackle Legendary, I\u2019d highly suggest this strategy.) The Grappleshot can be upgraded to add a paralyzing electric shock attack, boosting the Thruster will let you go invisible for a short time when you dash, and maxing out the Drop Wall gives you your own protective electric fence. I prioritized them in that order, ending with everything maxed out aside from two missing upgrades on the Drop Wall, and not only did the equipment add variety to how I handled abolishing the Banished, but many of the key boss fights cry out for one of them or another. (Thankfully, Infinite is never too heavy-handed about suggesting which one is best for each battle.) What is your favorite Halo vehicle? Ghost Warthog Banshee Scorpion Wraith Brute Chopper Wasp Mongoose Answer See Results Completing the open-world activities also earns you Valor points, which do you the big favor of unlocking additional weapons and vehicles you can instantly summon from reclaimed FOBs. (Usefully, you\u2019re also able to fast travel to any FOB you\u2019ve unlocked.) This became vital \u2013 not to mention extremely fun \u2013 as I approached the 15 optional High-Value Targets (HVTs) scattered around the ring. For instance, one HVT \u2013 well, technically two \u2013 is a pair of heavy-hitting Hunters who are flanked by a legion of supporting Banished (along with some mid-battle surprises). I surveyed that scene, saw the challenge I was up against, then fast-traveled back to the closest FOB so that I could order up a shiny new Scorpion tank I\u2019d unlocked access to, and then slowly rolled back to the HVT Hunters\u2019 turf, trained my tank turret on them one at a time, and gleefully eliminated them. Even these heavier vehicles aren\u2019t \u201cI win\u201d buttons, though, as bad guys on higher difficulties will quickly and repeatedly disable your vehicle with Shock Rifle blasts, often forcing you to try another strategy.

Infinite recaptures that signature freeform action in a big, fun way thanks to the diversity of locations and the ability to approach them from any angle and with any gear. Battles take place everywhere: in rivers, indoors,\u201d in midair, and you\u2019ll even have to fight uphill in scraps that feel like early 20th-century wars of attrition in the Halo universe (particularly on Heroic or Legendary difficulty). That encouraged me to use lots of the huge Halo arsenal rather than simply falling in love with one weapon (which would\u2019ve been the trusty Battle Rifle, of course) for the entire campaign. Sometimes I\u2019d want a charged-up Ravager plasma grenade launcher to stop charging Brutes in their tracks, other times a scoped weapon might be best for quickly headshotting Elites to drop their shields, and Grunts\u2026 well, they\u2019re still hilariously pathetic (mostly), though Infinite offers more ways to blow them up than ever thanks to new attachments on their backs. Vehicles, meanwhile, are of particular importance in a Halo where you can wander all over the entire ring. The Mongoose is the first ride you\u2019ll unlock, though without a co-op buddy, its only real purpose is zipping from point A to point B faster than you could run. But once you get into the meat of the campaign, you can call in a Warthog at a FOB, load it up with well-armed Marines, and stroll right up to a Banished stronghold and take out as many bad guys as you can from the perimeter before heading in. Or you can bring the Wasp in from above, clearing out significant numbers of Banished from the relative safety of the sky. Thanks to the large scale, vehicles have never felt more vital in Halo, which is probably the biggest compliment I can give because they\u2019ve always been a high point of this series.

        "Content": "Aiko's Choice is a punchy, compact standalone expansion for 2016's exceptional tactical stealth adventure Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, and that's all I really needed it to be. Across three beefy, brilliant new levels and three smaller interludes, this side story returns us to Japan's Edo period to sneak, slash, and stalk our way through expertly crafted outposts and fortresses. And these missions pick up where the already difficult original game left off in ramping up the challenge, so expect a good fight. All five of Blades of the Shogun's memorable party members are back, using their unique ability sets in tandem to chip away at devilishly clever clusters of diverse enemies. The basic routine hasn't really changed from the original game, which I loved, and if you\u2019re new to it you should check out my review from 2016 to see exactly why it works so well. But Aiko's Choice also feels more precise and less frustrating, thanks in part to a timer that reminds you if you've gone too long without saving. I also didn't run into any of those impenetrable, confounding situations like in the original campaign where it felt like I had to do something really cheesy or fiddly to progress. These scenarios are tough, but the solutions are never ridiculous. What We Said About Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun\u2019s uncommon attentiveness to characters and story elevate what is already a really entertaining and mentally stimulating quest across 17th-Century Japan. The near-constant annoyance of the camera definitely hindered my feeling of being a zen ninja assassin. Overall though, developer Mimimi has put together one of the most punishing and clever top-down stealth games I\u2019ve ever skulked through. - Leana Hafer, December 15, 2016 Score: 8.2 Read the full Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun review here. Did you play the base game of Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun? Yes, I beat it! Yes, but not the whole thing. No, not at all. I had never even heard of it. Answer See Results IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It's worth cautioning against anyone considering coming in without having played Blades of the Shogun before, though. This definitely is not a walk in the sakura garden. While none of the new areas in Aiko's Choice feel obnoxious, they definitely don't hesitate to throw you into the deep end. Whether I was rescuing a captured party member or sneaking into a secluded temple, the difficulty level felt about on par with some of the maps in the original game's third act. You can pick up some scrolls that remind you how certain character abilities work, and there is fair warning given that you should play at least the first few levels of the base game before jumping in to get familiar with the fundamentals. But it strikes me as a little odd that Daedalic would release Aiko\u2019s Choice as a standalone game if that\u2019s the expectation. Chaos Islands My favorite of the new missions involves a series of five islands that force you to use different combinations of party members for each. Only two of them are reachable by the heavily armored Mugen, who can't swim and relies on bridges to get around. Two others are in range of Takuma's powerful sniper rifle, allowing you to pick off particularly annoying enemies you can't easily sneak up on. The fifth, and most exciting, is out of rifle range and doesn't have a bridge, so you have to tackle it with only three characters. All of the new missions could stand up alongside the best ones from the main campaign, and I was downright impressed they managed to find so many new ways to make me think about these characters and their various tools again, all these years later. There are even a few small new mechanics to learn, like characters leaving footprints in the sand that can either give away your position or lure enemies into a trap. Screens  -  Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun - Aiko's Choice 5 Images The shorter, interlude missions that sit in between are nice little breaks that give the story and characters more time to breathe. They're not particularly difficult, and only took me 15 to 20 minutes to finish, which is a big contrast to the three hours or so each of the big infiltrations lasted. The last of them features the titular choice, which is a small but personally meaningful moment for Aiko, as well as a heartwarming and slightly tragic send-off for our small band of blademasters. It has the same sort of vibe as Mass Effect 3's Citadel DLC , getting to see your friends one last time before they embark on what would turn out to be a particularly costly mission in the original campaign. While the overall plot isn't exactly mind-blowing, there is also an interesting reveal about Aiko's character that changes the context of both campaigns and offers a little bit of a silver lining to its biggest tragedy. All of this is delivered with great voice acting, whether you play in English or Japanese. It was really nice getting to hang out with this crew again."

        "Content": "There\u2019s a technique popular in classical music called variation : a composer will take a single melody or musical idea and explore it in many different ways, potentially twisting it into dozens of different styles and structures without the overall work ever getting repetitive or tiresome. While that\u2019s not exactly a concept unique to music, it is a practice I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of while playing Inscryption \u2013 an undoubtedly odd connection to make, given that it presents itself as a horror-themed roguelite deck-building card game. But dig beneath that somewhat familiar shell and it reveals itself to be nothing short of a symphony of exciting twists, clever concepts, and consistently surprising iterations on the fundamentals that hooked me in its very first minutes. Inscryption holds much more than meets the eye, and a lot of what's so impressive about it are the unexpected places it ends up taking you. That means getting into many of the specific moments that make it so special will blunt their impact to a certain degree, so I am going to try to keep this review as spoiler-free as I can \u2013 both in terms of its story and some of its mechanics. That said, you only have to watch its launch trailer to understand that this isn\u2019t just another Slay the Spire -inspired entry into a genre that has begun to feel a little too derivative recently. In fact, it manages to partially live in that genre while simultaneously tearing it to pieces. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Much like developer Daniel Mullins Games\u2019 iconic Pony Island , Inscryption plays with meta themes in more ways than one. In this case, you start off playing a roguelike card game against a mysterious adversary shrouded in darkness, but the overall structure isn\u2019t actually one that\u2019s meant to be infinitely replayed. It took me about nine hours to reach the end of Inscryption, and it\u2019s a proper campaign that tells an interesting and spooky story, takes a few justified jabs at card game culture, and stands as a genuinely fun card game of its own. That game takes the form of head-to-head battles against an AI opponent: you play creature cards onto your side of the board which will automatically attack whatever is across from them each turn, be that opposing creatures or nothing at all. If it\u2019s the latter, any damage they would have done is instead added to your opponent\u2019s side of a tipping scale, but any damage you take will tip it back toward your direction \u2013 once one side of that scale is at least five damage heavier than the other, the match is over. That makes each fight a fun strategic tug-of-war, where taking a hit one turn could mean you\u2019re just out of reach of winning the next. Exciting bosses can also challenge you with prolonged encounters and unique twists, ranging from a miner who turns your creatures into chunks of gold to some later ones that broke my expectations in legitimately jaw-dropping ways. Watching Inscryption evolve so drastically is pretty incredible. \u201c That\u2019s the core of Inscryption that always stays constant, but the creatures you\u2019ll use, the way you play them, the extra mechanics they have, and the structure of the metagame around each match all shift drastically as you progress. For example, the resource for playing stronger cards starts out by forcing you to sacrifice smaller creatures to fuel bigger ones, which can make for some tough but rewarding choices. But before long you\u2019ll also get cards that instead spend \u201cbones\u201d generated when a friendly creature dies, adding another layer of planning to each decision. Later sections even explore systems closer to something like Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering , which keeps Inscryption\u2019s relatively simple fundamentals constantly fresh. Similarly, while it starts off using a branching roguelike structure recognizable to anyone who has played Slay the Spire, picking between paths and upgrading your deck as you go, it doesn\u2019t stay that way the whole time. Without spoiling any surprises, the skin and bones of Inscryption can change just as dramatically as its meat, but the heart at its center always keeps everything pumping to a familiar beat. That\u2019s good too, because it\u2019s not too difficult to stumble upon exploitable strategies that feel great in the moment but ultimately reduce any tough choices substantially, meaning certain sections might start to wear thin if they went on for too long on their own. Instead you get a delicious platter of all the games Inscryption could have been without any one of them feeling like a disjointed demo or half-baked idea, and watching it evolve so comprehensively is pretty incredible. Inscryption Gameplay Screenshots 19 Images Of course, slinging cards is only part of what Inscryption will ask you to do. In wonderfully strange fashion, it will also occasionally have you to stand up from the literal table you are playing at to explore the 3D room it\u2019s held in. There you\u2019ll solve simple escape room-style puzzles like finding the combination to a safe or figuring out how to unlock a container \u2013 many of which are tied directly to the card game itself in clever ways. They aren\u2019t the most complex riddles in the world, with the matches themselves being where I had most of my fun, but the overall vibe of Inscryption shines in these sections. Its dark, retro-ish art style is excellent across the entire campaign, and the creepy mood throughout is perfectly unsettling without ever really dipping into genuine \u201chorror.\u201d And while it\u2019s hard to say anything at all about the plot itself without ruining some of the surprise, Inscryption\u2019s haunted story is a genuinely compelling one as well. It\u2019s told through a mix of written dialogue and FMV cutscenes, and it provides a great (and often unexpectedly funny) structure to house all of its clever ideas. It feels like the kind of urban legend you\u2019d find propagated across creepypasta posts on message boards and other corners of the internet, but not in a way that feels dated or derivative.

        "Content": "World of Warcraft\u2019s universe has been steadily expanding since its release nearly 15 years ago, adding plenty of new characters, lands to explore, and enemies to conquer. However, one of its most popular storylines follows the downfall of the hero Arthas and his subsequent rise to become the Lich King. For those looking to return to Northrend and storm Icecrown Citadel once more, this board game will definitely scratch that itch for you. Based on the expansion of the same name, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King - A Pandemic System Board Game ( see it on Amazon , and wow that\u2019s a mouthful) is a cooperative tabletop game for up to five players that includes all the trappings of the popular MMO. It has iconic heroes, unique abilities, battles against the Scourge, and questing with your party, and it's all uniquely layered on the foundation of the popular Pandemic series of strategy board games . This isn\u2019t just a simple re-skin, though, as every element of gameplay has been faithfully adapted to feel right at home within Blizzard\u2019s popular universe. What\u2019s in the Box From the moment you crack open the box, you can tell this board game was created with attention to detail and plenty of care showcased in every component. The sprawling game board measures roughly 20\" x 30\" and features dozens of familiar locations from across Azeroth, including Naxxramas, Dalaran, Ulduar, and more.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It also features seven iconic characters from the Warcraft universe: Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, Sylvanas Windrunner, Varian Wrynn, Tirion Fordring, Muradin Bronzebeard, and Lady Liadrin. Each playable character comes with a detailed mini figurine to represent them during gameplay. Of course, there\u2019s also an incredibly detailed figurine of the Lich King himself, as well as his horde of undead cronies that include three abominations and dozens of small ghouls. One thing to note is that there are many incredibly sharp points on some of these figurines, and after poking myself one too many times I had to be more cautious when grabbing them. Each playable character also comes with a Hero Sheet, complete with unique abilities, a health bar, and some lore on the back. As with everything in this game, the Hero Sheets are adorned with gorgeous original art from the folks at Blizzard. There\u2019s also a deck of 63 Hero Cards used throughout the course of the game that all feature detailed artwork as well. I was surprised that hardly any of the artwork was reused from Hearthstone -- Blizzard\u2019s popular deck-building game based on the World of Warcraft universe -- making this feel like a wholly new adventure and not simply a repackaged cash-in. This isn\u2019t just a simple re-skin. Every gameplay element has been faithfully adapted to feel at home within the WoW universe. \u201c Additionally, you\u2019ll find 10 Quest Sheets, 30 Scourge Cards, Reference Cards to assist players during gameplay, various markers, and a punchboard containing high-quality cardboard cutouts to assemble Strongholds and a large replica of Icecrown Citadel. Press-seal bags are included to store everything between play sessions, and as with many of the other Pandemic series games, I\u2019m surprised at just how little space is wasted in the game box. Rules and How to Play The goal in the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King board game is simple: complete three quests to obtain unique rewards before storming Icecrown Citadel and putting an end to the Lich King once and for all. However, the Lich King\u2019s Scourge steadily spreads across Northrend, and you must complete your task before it consumes you and your party. Each player begins by selecting one of seven heroes to play as, all with unique abilities that can contribute to the team\u2019s overall success in some way. Every Hero Sheet has a set of numbers across the bottom that represents that character\u2019s health, which players must manage carefully as they explore and fight across the map. Turns play out similarly to the original Pandemic board game, with each player taking four total actions that include moving across the game board, fighting enemies, questing, or healing up. Instead of simply curing diseases, though, players are much more engaged in the moment-to-moment gameplay. Players will also accumulate a hand of cards such as attack and defense to aid in battle, healing cards to replenish health, or travel cards to quickly move around the board. There are also a limited number of Stronghold cards that can be added to the deck that allow you to place Strongholds around the map to act as a sort of \u201cfast-travel\u201d location for you and your team. As the Lich King\u2019s undead army expands across the map, players can choose to fight the Scourge as one of their turn actions. By rolling two dice, players can deal damage or block incoming attacks, as well as play cards from their hands to aid in battle. Characters on the same space can even team up in battle, making it truly feel like you\u2019re in a party together mowing down waves of enemies. In addition to fighting, players can also choose to partake in a Quest as one of their turn actions. Since completing Quests are a key component of the team\u2019s win condition, it\u2019s important to always keep an eye on the party\u2019s Quest progress. The game board is divided into three regions, indicated by the color of the spaces within. Each region contains one of three Quest Sheets (with a total of nine available) that the team must work together to complete during the course of the game. Quests will take multiple player turns to complete using a combination of dice rolls, cards from their hands, and help from teammates, and require plenty of coordination. Every Quest Sheet has a unique boss enemy featured on it that deals damage to the questing player, as well as some sort of mechanic that players will need to strategize around, such as reducing the number of dice that can be rolled, prevent healing, and more. Once players reach the end of the Quest, a unique reward is revealed that provides a powerful single-use card that the team can use to help turn the tide in their favor. While the Quest system definitely works fine, I would have liked to see it fleshed out a bit more. It essentially boils down to moving a marker along a linear path and doesn\u2019t feel as active or engaging as the battles. It feels like a missed opportunity having all these iconic raid bosses featured on the Quest Sheets and never actually getting to interact with them in any meaningful way. That goes for the final Lich King encounter, as well, which is effectively a longer \u201cQuest\u201d that doesn\u2019t raise the stakes all that much. That being said, the moment-to-moment gameplay of strategizing with your teammates as you push back the encroaching Scourge on the board while trying to complete the Quests perfectly encapsulates that signature stress felt while playing other Pandemic board games, which is one of the best classic board games . Every action taken must be carefully thought out as things can get out of hand very quickly and one wrong move could lead to your inevitable defeat. I found the Wrath of the Lich King board game to be slightly more difficult - even on the easiest difficulty - than the traditional Pandemic board game... and that was with a full group of five players. Turns are a bit more complicated as you\u2019re not only managing the game board, but also your own hero\u2019s health. As with most games, I imagine as your group becomes more experienced you\u2019ll be able to anticipate setbacks and plan ahead accordingly. And, for those ready to take on more of a challenge, there are three increasing difficulties that make the Scourge more potent and reduce the number of Strongholds available. There\u2019s even a solo play mode, which I still found to be an engaging experience. However, the fun in this game truly lies with team-based decision-making. There\u2019s even a solo play mode, which I still found to be an engaging experience. \u201c With seven unique heroes and nine quests in total, there\u2019s plenty of replayability here that will provide fun for dozens of game sessions. The cooperative nature of the game coupled with dice rolling-based battles and quests makes the Wrath of the Lich King board game feel like a very lite version of D&D that can be completed in about an hour.

A Souls-influenced take on the side-scrolling Metroidvania , sprawling in scope yet intricate in detail, it stands resolute, patiently waiting for you to reveal its secrets while testing your mettle with bouts of tough combat and rigorous sequences of platforming. Progress is earned in increments where lessons are not just learned but fully internalized. You chip away, chisel in hand, until Grime eventually reveals itself as a thing of beauty \u2013 a monument to whatever we're calling this genre today \u2013 and one of the best \"Souls-vanias\" of recent times. For all its difficulty, what's more notable is Grime's generosity. Killing enemies and discovering secrets earns you mass, the primary currency and the equivalent of souls. But unlike most other similar games, in Grime you don't lose your mass when you die. You keep it. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask This one design choice has a profound effect. By letting you retain mass upon death, Grime lets you level up after you die. You respawn back at the last surrogate (Grime's term for a Dark Souls -style bonfire) and can immediately spend mass to increase your health or stamina for a little extra survivability, or boost one of the three damage-dealing stats (strength, dexterity, and resonance). The returns here aren't enormous \u2013 they're improvements at the margins, at best a few percentage points with each level-up \u2013 but the process feels significant in terms of the sheer relief. Sure, you died, and you're gonna have to repeat what is in all likelihood a large section of the level, but you get to hang onto everything you picked up along the way and gain the benefit of being slightly better equipped to tackle its challenges on your return. It's liberating. The additional stress of the corpse-run, of retracing your steps to recover your lost cash while knowing that another death means permanent loss, is absent here. It doesn\u2019t make Grime easy by any measure, but it does mean you never feel punished for failure. Instead, you're afforded an infinite supply of missteps, and each time you\u2019re picked back up again, dusted off and delivered a little pep talk before you\u2019re sent on your way once more. The lack of death penalty encourages experimentation and exploration. \u201c More than that, though, the lack of penalty encourages experimentation and exploration. I never felt that nagging doubt over whether I should press on into uncharted territory or retreat to the last checkpoint to cash in. I simply explored. Grime's map is a dense network of tunnels, chambers, and nooks and crannies, all looping through and around each other, interconnecting in places both expected and surprising. I greeted each junction with an inquisitive confidence, keen to discover what lay ahead rather than the almost paralyzing anxiety over which path is the right one to take that often accompanies more punitive Soulslike design. This approach dovetails with the areas where Grime adheres more closely to the Souls template, such as storytelling. Echoing From Software's restraint, NPCs speak in riddles and metaphor, alluding to grand-sounding beings and events whose mystery is deepened by the impression you're only barely scratching the surface. Other characters are even less coherent \u2013 muttering away, unconcerned by your presence, lost in their own little worlds. Even your overall goal is unexplained beyond the impishly cryptic utterings of the few NPCs who seem invested in your journey. Screens  -  Grime 8 Images Silent as a stone, Grime sustains mystery and heightens moments of revelation by wilfully withholding information. And because it encourages you to explore and experiment, it was so rewarding to discover all of its little secrets and nuances and intricacies on my own terms. While the basics are explained, much is left for you to figure out. Each of the Metroid-style abilities acquired after defeating a boss have their primary function explained, but they all possess a secondary use or variation that may not become apparent until hours later. Unlocking these tiny epiphanies \u2013 \"Wait, that's how THAT works?\" \u2013 provided some of the most delightful moments of my time with Grime. Grime is a tough, demanding experience with no difficulty options. \u201c But there were also plenty of moments when I thought about giving it all up. You may notice that this review is going up more than a week after Grime came out, and that\u2019s largely because it is very difficult to beat (also because I hit a game-breaking bug and had to restart, but that was fixed before release). It's a tough, demanding experience, and of course there are no difficulty options. Even with the salve of being able to spend mass upon death, there were still plenty of occasions when I feared I wouldn't make it to the end. The combat is tough. Enemies hit hard and often, and your stamina bar depletes rapidly. Get yourself in a bad spot and you'll quickly find yourself dead. But enemy attacks are readable \u2013 even telegraphed \u2013 and you're equipped with useful moves to avoid them. Dashing can be used to put distance between yourself and an enemy, or to dodge through them and their advance, thanks to an ample period of invulnerability. Attacks can be parried with the correct timing, and eventually a staggered enemy can be absorbed as you literally seize its final breath. Killing enemies by conventional means is usually quicker than absorbing their breath, but sometimes you'll want to get in an early parry to eliminate their shield before switching to your preferred weapon to finish the job. There's considerable variety here, with the numerous swords, axes, and clubs, each falling somewhere on a granular spectrum from \"hits light and fast\" to \"hits hard but slow.\" Even within a category, similar weapons are distinguished by their moveset and it's worthwhile keeping two equipped in case one is more suitable to the task at hand. I played a \"strength build\" at first, settling on a club and sword that were both described as slow, and output a similar amount of damage, but the distinct arcs of their respective attacks \u2013 both light and heavy \u2013 meant I found myself switching between them constantly and really enjoying having to think about which weapon was going to be more effective at any given moment. Underlining the complexity Grime wrings from its weapon variety, on a second character I opted for a \"dex build\" and was pleased to realise I had to rethink the tactics I adopted during combat, even finding enemies that had given me trouble previously were now dispatched more easily (and vice versa). The handful of arms that scale with the resonance stat are more exotic \u2013 to the extent that I didn't even understand how they worked during the brief time I spent with them \u2013 and left me anticipating what new discoveries a third character would bring. The fine balance of combat is the tension between absorbing and attacking. \u201c The fine balance of combat is the tension between absorbing and attacking. Parrying is risky because a mistimed attempt leaves you open to counter-attack. Successfully parrying will do some damage but it's nowhere near as effective as attacking, and trying to parry more than one enemy at a time is usually a terrible idea. But some enemies need to be parried before you can hit them with your weapon, and you need to parry to be able to absorb an enemy's breath \u2013 and that\u2019s a maneuver vital to both replenishing your ability to heal and unlocking traits that boost your performance. It's a lot to think about in the heat of the action, especially when you're trekking through lengthy areas where the combat feels relentless, multiple enemy types are testing you with wildly different attack patterns, the platforms are littered with harmful environmental hazards, and you're still expected to perform some deft acrobatics. It's, well\u2026 it can be A LOT. But gradually applying order to chaos is such a satisfying process; learning to read enemy behaviours, when to prioritize absorbing and when to start attacking, which enemies to take down first, how you're going to make time and space to use your heal, and how you're going to escape if necessary. It all helps distil a sense of clarity in the face of what can feel like overwhelming odds. The boss fights are tougher still. With the exception of the first, every boss is a stern challenge; even the easier ones required me to make double-digit attempts, and I was stuck on the hardest for an entire weekend and countless deaths. Even so, I enjoyed every minute of it. The boss designs are visually arresting and, at first, feel like nothing you've encountered before. A couple of late-game bosses, in particular, initially seem impossible, leaving me wondering \u2013 even after many attempts \u2013 how anyone could conceivably avoid that attack or when I'll ever get a chance to deal it some damage. But I soon started to discern familiar elements, began to appreciate its attack patterns, and recognised sparse windows of opportunity. I realised there's nothing unfair about them, nothing I couldn't have anticipated and avoided if I\u2019d done your homework and remained vigilant. And yet, if anything, the platforming is toughest of all. Not consistently so, I should make clear \u2013 most of the time I explored Grime with ease, running along solid ground and performing simple jumps and dashes. But when the platforming ramps up, it raises the overall challenge to its peak. For me, at least, the difficulty here is derived from the sheer length of the trickiest platforming sections, not because they demand precision. They're tests of endurance, of whether you can string together screen after screen of jumping, dashing, and just generally flinging yourself in between all manner of deathtrap without missing a beat and falling to your doom. And they're exhausting to undertake, right up until the point you finally clear them and that exhaustion is swept away by exhilaration. What's your level-up priority in an action game? Health Damage Stamina/energy Answer See Results This became the cycle for me throughout Grime: exhaustion then exhilaration. It's a draining experience since for much of the time it demands all of your attention and concentration. Many sections and encounters, whether heavy with combat or platforming or occasionally both, initially feel impossible. I put down the controller many times, thinking to myself \"I'm never going to get through this.\" But I persisted, I paid attention, I experimented, I regrouped, and then I tried again and again and again, learning a little more with each failure. Each daunting new challenge I broke down into its constituent parts, identifying how I'd evade that attack or how to position myself for the timing of that jump, and I was able to conquer the challenge by putting those parts back together, piece by piece. In the end I felt like a master craftsman. I'd spent dozens of hours chipping away at Grime, steadily knocking it in to shape, revealing its textures and contours. Grime is still rock hard, but as the credits rolled, I could put down the chisel, sit back, and admire its beauty."

Six years later, this freshly remade standalone game from original developer Modern Storyteller reworks, refines, and greatly expands upon the same cleverly interconnected ensemble cast and morally provocative story of that already fantastic mod. Breaking away from the Elder Scrolls universe finally allows this terrific adventure to come into its own, with plenty of fresh twists, turns, and a heaping helping of self-aware dialogue that can leave your mouth ajar. The Forgotten City begins as you wake up next to the Tiber River with a mysterious hooded figure. After creating your character, they send you into the nearby ruins in search of a stranger named Al, and the rest is Ancient Roman history. No longer set in Skyrim\u2019s Dwemer ruins, this Forgotten City is instead a gorgeous Roman stronghold, complete with historically accurate structures and architecture, including Villas and a public Forum. It even has its very own Aqueducts that provide easy access across the city. It\u2019s all a sight to behold, and the reimagined look and layout makes that true even if you\u2019re a returning fan of the mod. The Forgotten City Gameplay Screenshots 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask \u201cThe many shall suffer for the sins of the one.\u201d This is the fabled Golden Rule that serves as the central focal point of The Forgotten City\u2019s story, and it dictates that you and the city\u2019s 23 or so residents can\u2019t steal from or attack another human, lest the city\u2019s guardian statues spring to life and methodically turn each citizen into solid gold - trapping them forever. But you don\u2019t need constant combat to make it delightfully fascinating to unravel each of the city\u2019s many delicate layers, and the deeper you go the more obvious it becomes that a life without clear crime is no utopia. The city\u2019s least savory denizens use loopholes, social engineering, and deception to entrap and purposefully mislead one another, skirting the Golden Rule altogether. The Forgotten City is positively dripping with brain teasing moral quandaries as a result \u2013 without spoiling anything, there are points where you have to break the Golden Rule, as well as times where you must stop it from being broken, even if it would mean helping innocent people out of awful predicaments. The absolute best part of The Forgotten City is its excellently written characters. Each person has their own motives, problems, and opinions of one another and of the Golden Rule itself to discover, with standouts like the conniving Aurelia being particularly fun to talk to. While I was initially a bit disappointed to see that there were no RPG systems to use during dialogue, especially after a game like Disco Elysium showed just how interesting they could be, the conversations are very engaging without the need to roll skill checks. Those things arguably wouldn\u2019t even fit into what The Forgotten City is trying to do anyway, as its dialogue is tightly written and filled with mysteries to piece together, and your decisions carry more than enough weight as-is. The absolute best part of The Forgotten City is its excellently written characters. \u201c The only misstep with its characters is that their top notch dialogue occasionally suffers from facial animations that range from dubious to outright hilarious. Modern Storyteller says a fix might arrive for launch, but it wasn\u2019t worked out in time for this review, leaving stiff performances from otherwise exquisitely well-written and decently-voiced NPCs. It isn\u2019t exactly the longest adventure either, about 10 hours if you want to see everything and reach the canon ending at a reasonable pace, but it absolutely had me wanting to follow every thread I could find. You can \u201cbeat\u201d The Forgotten City early if you don\u2019t want to do everything, but you\u2019re really missing out on its most interesting bits by doing so. It\u2019s practically begging you to tease these layers apart too, and all that intrigue is eventually paid off quite well. In case you do turn all your suspects to gold, The Forgotten City makes genius use of a time loop mechanic to keep your investigation going smoothly. Every time you break the Golden Rule by, say, killing somebody or stealing an item, you must run back to the starting portal and begin the day anew. The world resets to its original state but you keep everything in your inventory, allowing tangible progress from day-to-day and leading to some interesting conversations, such as how you know a character is about to do something or how you have a certain item in your possession that you couldn\u2019t possibly have without stealing it. Retracing your steps each day might sound tedious, but another great touch is that you don\u2019t need to redo every quest each time. You can conveniently send Galerius, the most well-meaning yet tragically impressionable man on the planet, to run off and do each of your previously completed quests for you, bringing you back up to speed every time you need to restart. The world is designed to draw you in and keep you captivated. \u201c The Forgotten City has some combat too, but it\u2019s minuscule and quite simple overall. Granted, it isn\u2019t really about action sequences, combat, or platforming \u2013 it has all that, but it\u2019s only sprinkled in at appropriate times to improve the pace, and never outstays its welcome. Most of the time, you\u2019ll be sussing out information through dialogue, exploration, and some pretty basic but enjoyable platforming. That last point usually involves shooting arrows from Apollo\u2019s bow, which lets you turn organic material like ivy or algae into gold, providing a solid platform for climbing or launching yourself to the next point of interest. No matter what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s easy to get swept away by The Forgotten City\u2019s incredibly detailed visuals \u2013 another obvious step up from its origins as a Skyrim mod. The whole layout of the world is designed to draw you in and keep you captivated from start to finish. The city itself is built on a mixture of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Sumerian architecture and you do meet people from each of these respective cultures as well. But even with the eye-catching environments, some of the most interesting parts of this world are the many smaller items that are decorative by nature, but can still be picked up and examined. Each one is labeled with interesting or educational tooltips, lore, and in-jokes that make every inch of The Forgotten City feel lived-in and real. Have you played the original The Forgotten City Skyrim mod? Yes, I beat it! I installed it but didn't finish it I have not played it I'd never even heard of it before this Answer See Results Beyond the visuals, transitioning to a standalone game has also allowed for the arrival of some welcome quality-of-life features. It\u2019s got less bugs for one, but it also benefits from a much cleaner font and text style than Skyrim, as well as a wildly useful feature that lets you tap a key to automatically follow an NPC if they\u2019re guiding you to a set location. Mimicking a trend among modern AAA games, there\u2019s even a solid in-game photo mode that allows you to capture the sheer beauty of this remote city."

Its sequel, Chivalry 2 continues that tradition, and I think it's actually a better multiplayer experience because of that philosophy. There\u2019s still a lot of skill involved, but it's easier to dive in and start getting some gloriously gory kills without feeling like you're a sheep surrounded by wolves. And that's how you build and keep a strong community. Chivalry 2 catapults you onto stylish, saturated battlefields with up to 64 players in objective-based team modes or a giant free-for-all. There aren't a ton of maps right now, but I was pretty impressed with the ones we have. Each has a good variety of objectives to attack and defend, exciting terrain and architecture, an effective mix of open areas and bottlenecks, and great overall pacing. One moment you might be pushing titanic siege towers up to a wall with ballista bolts flying at you from above, and the next you might be trying to loot as much gold as possible from a village and get it back to your cart before time runs out. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Sure, there are definitely a few objectives that feel unbalanced at the moment. The bridge on Falmire, for instance, I've only seen successfully taken by the attackers once in the dozens of times I've played it. The ramp on Lionspire is pretty sticky, too. But it's nothing that a few minor tweaks shouldn\u2019t be able to fix. And it might even out a bit once everyone gets a bit more experience and understands how these objectives work. I soon found that there are kits to support just about every playstyle I could imagine. \u201c Rather than having you build out a complex custom kit with all the exact weapons and armor you want, Chivalry has 12 set classes divided into four archetypes, with four available at the start and the rest unlocked as you go. You can also unlock new primary and secondary weapons within each class, so there's a lot of meaningful progression to work toward. I was a little disappointed I couldn't just go crazy mixing and matching, but I soon found that there are kits to support just about every playstyle I could imagine, from a deadly crossbow sniper to a frenzied, axe-hurling berserker. Which game has the best medieval combat? Kingdom Come: Deliverance Mount & Blade (1 or 2) Mordhau Skyrim Chivalry (1 or 2) Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Some have stronger niches than others. There's a rogue class which gets a bonus to backstab damage, but I never really found that I could make the most of this in team fights or one-on-one. The skirmisher, who throws javelins, is supposed to be kind of a hybrid between a melee and a ranged class, but ends up just feeling worse at both than her specialist counterparts. And shields, I found more often a burden than a boon. But the offensive monsters like the devastator and the crusader are a ton of fun. And while you'll see plenty of people in chat moaning about archers being too powerful, it does require a lot of practice and good instincts to make the most of them. In another clever bit of design, you recharge powers faster by doing things your class is good at and should be doing anyway. \u201c I also admired that, within each class, special abilities tend to focus on supporting your team rather than simply making you better as a single combatant. Even if you're not the best one-on-one fighter in the world, you can still make a world of difference in big encounters by blowing your war horn and giving a hefty area-of-effect heal to your side of the melee. And in another clever bit of design, you recharge these powers faster by doing things your class is good at and should be doing anyway, like getting kills with your charge attack as the furious raider or blocking attacks as the stalwart guardian. The combat system is, of course, the core of everything. And with more than 30 hours under my belt, I'm loving it. It's not the most realistic medieval brawler I've ever played, but this is power fantasy, not a documentary. The overall flow of it and the ways in which it limits how much an extremely skilled player can absolutely dominate the battlefield hit a sweet spot for me. Though don't think you can easily climb to the top of the leaderboards by wildly swinging a mace around. What We Said About Chivalry: Medieval Warfare Lopping off appendages in gory displays of warrior aggression makes Chivalry: Medieval Warfare's up-close and personal melee combat a gritty and fulfilling on a primal level. Though the lack of complexity sometimes works both for and against it, getting caught up in the flow of battle yields many hours of man-stabbing amusement. Like its competition, Chivalry hasn't quite perfected the formula for medieval warfare, but it's a violent, fun time nonetheless. - Nathan Meunier, October 9, 2012 Score: 7.9 Read the full Chivalry: Medieval Warfare review There are just enough ways to attack, parry, riposte, dodge, and counter that it pays to be able to think on your feet and react to what your opponent is doing. But executing those moves once you've committed to a decision doesn't require godlike reflexes or extremely precise mouse movements. There's a high skill ceiling, but the difference between a pretty good player and a really good player is smaller than in a game like Mordhau, which I think is a smart decision. Bad and okay players are always going to outnumber the truly exceptional ones, and they need to still be able to have fun or they'll abandon you. Even if you're the best blademaster in the realm, you need teammates to stand on the objective. It also doesn't feel too arcadey, which is an issue I had with the first Chivalry. The difference between a pretty good player and a really good player is smaller than in a game like Mordhau, which I think is smart. \u201c Aside from the very first couple of days, the servers seem to be holding up pretty well, too. Getting into a match is lightning quick, thanks in no small part to the willingness to include a few bots to get those huge, 64-player matches off the ground. I've rarely experienced any major connection issues while playing for at least a few hours a day. The skill-based aspect of matchmaking could still use some work. It will auto-balance teams if one side seems to be completely dominating, but there doesn't seem to be anything to keep the swapped players from going back to their original team if a spot opens up. And I see that happen a lot. So if people are just being jerks and insisting on wearing their favorite color, you can end up in some extremely lopsided battles. Chivalry 2 Images (Not Gameplay) 23 Images The one other thing I've found a bit lacking is the visual customization of your character. It\u2019s nice that you can play as a woman for the first time, but if you do, each class only has one voice to choose from and far fewer face options than the guys get. Also some of the ladies look pretty weird, almost like they took an existing male face model and stretched it out like the title screen for Super Mario 64. There are some bizarre male faces, too, but the difference in quality is pretty easy to see. At least there's a good variety of armor styles, heraldry, and weapon skins you can unlock with premium currency or in-game cash you get from levelling up. Some of the skins require you to reach a certain level with the weapon before you can even buy them, so you can show off your skill with a shiny, gilded sword. And rest assured, as far as I could find there's nothing that's exclusively locked behind spending real money."

Even more incredibly, this hodgepodge of awesome components crammed together into one game create something utterly unique and enduringly memorable. Griftlands is a deck-building roguelike in the same vein as genre standouts like Slay the Spire and Monster Train in which you earn random cards battle by battle until you lose and do it all over again. The main way Griftlands distinguishes itself from those games is that each of its campaigns tells a more substantial story \u2013 and for the most part they\u2019re all exceptional. Whether I was playing a mercenary on a quest for revenge, a retired soldier turned double agent who\u2019s playing both sides of a rebellion, or a blackout-drunk slacker who\u2019s been disowned by his family, everyone \u2013 whether they\u2019re playable or an NPC \u2013 is looking out for number one. They might be looking to make a quick buck, plotting revenge, or making a grab for power, but almost no one is innocent or without ulterior motives.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask My favorite character, Smith, is an idiotic, carousing, two-legged dumpster fire of a person with practically no redeeming qualities... so I really related with him. His story centers around redeeming himself for a life wasted and the Disco Elysium -esque way in which he couldn\u2019t care less about anyone or anything around him was an ideal backdrop for my heartless plotting. Figuring out a strategy to make the right friends and mitigate (i.e. murder) my enemies continues to bring me no end of joy. Even after completing all three campaigns, the tongue-in-cheek fantasy world of con artists and thugs, goofy personalities, and hilarious dialogue were all just more reasons to try \u201cjust one more run\u201d \u2013 even when I got my teeth knocked in at higher difficulties. There was always something pushing me to complete the run or at least get to the next major plot development. Figuring out a strategy to make the right friends and mitigate (i.e. murder) my enemies continues to bring me no end of joy. \u201c The general outline of each campaign follows the same storyline every time, but the exact missions you\u2019re sent on, the characters involved, and the random encounters you stumble upon are procedurally generated so that no two runs are quite the same. With the exception of Sal\u2019s campaign, which is a pretty bland revenge quest with few surprises, the stories aren\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to skip; even on repeat playthroughs I\u2019ve found that small details change enough to keep it interesting, and it\u2019s all based on the missions generated and the decisions you made. Adding to the already substantial amount of charm is Griftlands\u2019 hand-drawn Saturday Morning Cartoon style and bizarre-looking anthropomorphic animals and humans who live in its world. Voice acting is done through a Sims-style gibberish language, meaning you\u2019ll be reading a lot of subtitles (which are enhanced by the tone from the voices), but the soundtrack during combat is every bit as catchy as you\u2019d hope from a game you\u2019re expected to spend a lot of time playing through again and again. Which roguelike/lite rules your heart? The Binding of Isaac Dead Cells Slay the Spire Hades Spelunky/2 Other - Tell us in the comments Answer See Results What makes Griftlands\u2019 style of adventure especially interesting is that victory is not all about stabbing people in the front. Confrontation comes in two delicious flavors: social encounters, called Negotiations, and turn-based Battles, both of which require you to curate and upgrade their own specific deck of cards. Each mode has in common card-based mechanics and knocking down an opposing health bar before yours is emptied, but that\u2019s more or less where the resemblance ends. The dramatic change of pace from encounter to encounter gives Griftlands a different feel than most of its peers. Negotiations are slow, strategic, and complex contests of wits where you use persuasion and coercion cards to whittle down the enemy\u2019s core argument. \u201c Battles tend to be fast, action-packed, and very similar to Slay the Spire (and equally challenging and replayable), where you and any allies or pets you might have knock the snot out of all manner of beasts, robots, or fellow grifters who cross you. Because combat can be brutally challenging on higher difficulties, creating the perfect mixture of defensive cards, offensive cards, status effects, and items is essential for survival. In one playthrough with Sal I stacked up cards that cause bleed damage to drain my opponent\u2019s health, while in another I used Smith\u2019s bizarre ability to regenerate health by getting hammered and hurting himself to create an unstoppable rampaging drunken ogre. And, as is typical of this type of game, I couldn\u2019t replay those the same way even if I wanted to; thanks to the way adventures are procedurally generated and loot is randomized for each playthrough, you have to learn to roll with the punches and find the best strategy by literally using the cards you\u2019re dealt, which is a blast. Negotiations, on the other hand, are slow, strategic, and complex contests of wits where you use persuasion and coercion cards to whittle down the enemy\u2019s core argument in an almost incomprehensible flurry of status effects. Arguably there\u2019s even more strategy to these encounters than to Battles because of all the different status effects and modifiers that require you to continually re-evaluate your plans \u2013 which can be fun or annoying depending on the circumstances. Also, there are multiple approaches for getting your opponent to see things your way. You can focus on \u201cdomination\u201d cards, which use threats, insults, and coercion; or you can try \u201cinfluence\u201d cards, which use swagger, persuasion, and tact. Griftlands Screenshots 11 Images As you debate your opponent you\u2019ll deal and receive dozens of buffs, debuffs that can be a bit of a headache. In one particularly irritating encounter, the enemy relentlessly spams your deck with cards that cost money to use or deal damage to you unless you pay, and even adds a dollar cost to playing your own cards. Watching your hard-earned cash fly away while a smug cockroach smiles on-screen can be infuriating \u2013 but beating them at their own game is almost always worth the effort. Sometimes the amount of things to consider and juggle in Negotiations can get tiresome, which makes exerting brute force through Battles seem like an ideal alternative. That can create a problem, though, because attacking everything in sight just to avoid talking through your problems tends to make you a lot of enemies, and making lots of enemies usually leads to death. And I mean the bad kind, too. As in, your own death. That said, once I took the time to learn all of the different elements at play in a Negotiation and develop a strategy that let me utterly dominate someone without ever drawing a weapon was an incredibly rewarding loop. Decisions you make, big and small, tend to have a ripple effect throughout any given run that can come back to bite you or save you. \u201c There\u2019s also quite a bit of randomness to deal with that\u2019s mostly outside of your control. As you work your way through the verbal or physical blows of Griftlands, you\u2019ll be forced to make lots of decisions with unknown consequences: side with one faction over another, make judgement calls during random encounters, and choose to draft and upgrade cards and character perks that may have a massive impact on your Battle and Negotiation decks. But these outcomes can be influenced by the decisions you\u2019ve made around who to become friends with and who to alienate. For example, if you get into a Negotiation against someone you\u2019ve taken the time to build a positive relationship with, the going will be much easier since they like you. Or even if someone who likes you is simply in the room when you get into trouble with someone else, they\u2019ll come to your defense and grant you bonuses to the encounter. Likewise, earning the ire of people around you will saddle you with devastating debuffs and make the going much more difficult. Decisions you make, big and small, tend to have a ripple effect throughout any given run that can come back to bite you or save you down the road. In a world where backstabbing and ruthlessness are a core part of gameplay, things get sticky very fast and the stakes are incredibly high in the best possible way. The 10 Best Roguelike Games 10 Images Although each campaign is relatively short and can all be beaten in a few hours if you\u2019re good or lucky (and I was neither), the sheer replayability of Griftlands is staggering. There are tons of unlockables, modifiers, increased difficulties, and alternate game modes. Like most deck-building games you\u2019ll unlock prestige difficulties with each new tier you\u2019ve conquered and gain access to new cards that are added to the available pool in the next run. You\u2019ll also get to buy perks that give you slight advantages in the next playthrough, so even if you\u2019re struggling to complete a campaign you\u2019re making progress with each failure \u2013 a nifty feature if you find yourself staring at the \u201cgame over\u201d screen more often than you\u2019d like to admit (like I may have). Once you\u2019ve had your fill of the story, an unlockable Brawl mode will let you cut to the chase and skip all the dialogue and decisions to give you back-to-back Battle and Negotiation encounters that simulate what you might find in a given run. This is helpful if you\u2019re like me and sometimes just want a little deck-building combat without all those pesky concerns like nuance or being a moral person. There\u2019s also daily challenges and a boss rush mode that puts you through the paces with the most difficult encounters that Griftlands offers."

Chicory is best-described as a top-down Zelda-like adventure sans combat where the entire game is a giant coloring book.

Brush Fill Shapes Eraser Pencil Answer See Results What this ultimately results in is a very clever new layer to what would otherwise be pleasant but familiar top-down adventure puzzle-solving. Your paint is persistent; you'll always know where you've been and what you did there based on the splatters you left behind, making Chicory's world stressless and inviting to explore and fill in. It's worth revisiting areas, too, as in typical top-down adventure fashion you'll have powers later on that will unlock more hidden areas you couldn't access before, each containing treasures or little subplots that add further color and personality to Chicory's cast. What's more, characters will frequently ask you to paint or decorate things for them: houses, donuts, logos, furniture, and so forth. Some will have specific color requests, but for the most part they just want the thing done however you like it, and will react with delight to your work whether you're an auteur or amateur. Chicory recognizes that its audience may think they are god-awful at art. But it offers the tools and encouragement to try anyway. \u201c This is emblematic of all of Chicory: it is not a stressful or fast-paced game (apart from a few brief boss encounters). It's a thoughtful game that wants you to walk along with it at a pace that feels pleasant, with puzzles that require consideration but never strain, sidequests in measured but not overwhelming amounts, and plenty of fun things to discover or stumble upon that never feel mandatory or guilt-inducing if you miss them. It recognizes that its audience, me included, may think they are objectively god-awful at art. But then it offers the tools and encouragement to try anyway, and goes farther to challenge those self-effacing beliefs by rejoicing in thoughtful effort without judgment. Chicory does this in large ways through story scenes, but also in small ways, like having its funny and adorable NPCs pop up unexpectedly in areas you've been through before to admire the art you did there. An Interactive Coloring Book Whatever your skill level, Chicory is full of optional content inviting you to play around with its many built-in art tools. An art academy subplot lets you take art classes and attempt to recreate different pieces of art, with your recreations later posted and admired by NPCs around the world. If you're feeling limited by the four-color restriction per area, an NPC will eventually give you a brush style that lets you customize your colors with full freedom. You can also design your own brush style and clothing items. There's a built-in GIF-maker that lets you capture your painting process. And while you can paint any area however you like, there are multiple places set up in specific ways to invite explicit creativity, like a huge blank building you're asked to tag, or a mountain viewpoint where NPCs request you color a sky for them to admire. Oh, and because color is utterly unnecessary for anything other than fun aesthetic, Chicory is fully accessible to colorblind players. Furthermore, rarely do I encounter games that have so expertly grasped the precise amount of everything they need to have. All of Chicory, from its length (10 to 20 hours, depending on how much you paint and explore) to its quantity of sidequests and collectibles to the length and difficulty of its puzzles to the amount of dialogue and discovery is just right. Chicory never overstays its welcome, concludes all its moments in a satisfactory way, and offers more for those who wish it without guilting or pressuring you into pushing past natural stopping points. It is impressive in its exactness. All this alone would make for a very good game. It's difficult for me to explain why Chicory affected me so personally without getting into spoiler territory, but I think it's critical to highlight the story and character-centered reasons why it is elevated beyond being just a well-made Zelda-like with a clever paint tool. Chicory tells an earnest story about people who create things, and the ways in which being a creator impacts them. Though it's specifically about visual art, anyone who \"makes\" \u2014 whether that's artists of any school, or those like myself who fall more into the territory of \"craft\" rather than art \u2014 could easily find that something personal resonates with them here. Chicory is about characters who are intrinsically wedded to their work, and who also have their work on public display. \u201c Chicory is about characters who are intrinsically wedded to their work, and who also have their work constantly on public display, subject to the critique of absolutely everyone in the world at all times. Most of its citizens are kind and encouraging of your efforts, recognizing that you're in a tricky and unexpected situation. But that doesn't stop many of them from pointing out the flaws of past wielders, or even expressing nervous doubt in your own abilities as the implications of your job for everyone else get scarier. And as Chicory herself points out \u2013 and the story illustrates more pointedly later \u2013 while the pressure others put on you to do your job well is stressful on its own, it can be nothing compared to the pressure people put on themselves. Especially when they are following in the footsteps of someone they deeply admire. There's a lot of close-to-home reflection in Chicory on imposter syndrome, the relationship between mentors and mentees, how mental health struggles particularly impact creators, and how we are all so often our own worst critics. But there are also supporting characters with brief, sharp at times, but always kind commentary on topics like grief, workaholism, and the struggles of reckoning with sexuality and identity. It is at all times sensitive and empathetic, but doesn't sugar-coat or present a cheesy solution that magically erases the problems of all its protagonists, even in its conclusion. There's a lot of close-to-home reflection in Chicory on imposter syndrome, and how mental health struggles impact creators. \u201c And critically, its story is beautifully suited to its gameplay, with its paint mechanics both subtly and overtly highlighting its themes at every moment. For instance, Chicory has \"boss battles\" of a sort, where the painted darkness the protagonist faces not only takes the explicit forms of those it represents, but also more subtly reflects their actual art styles. In another example, the world remembers not just the paint you throw on the environment, but your more deliberate creations as well, resulting in emotional callbacks to your past work when you visit characters you've seen before and are clued into what your art has meant to them. Chicory is at all times illustrating exactly what it is fundamentally about in a way that I feel few games manage to fully express without veering into the far excesses of either lengthy cutscenes or gameplay challenges that kill story momentum and feeling. For all these reasons, on top of which I'll add Lena Raine's absolutely incredible soundtrack, I can enthusiastically recommend Chicory whether you consider yourself a \"maker\" or not. Chicory constantly asks its audience for understanding and empathy toward those whose work they consume. I've had a lot of complex feelings lately related to seeing those I admire most in my profession as human beings with flaws as well as virtues, and Chicory helped me process those while encouraging me to give them grace. But Chicory also wants me to give that same grace to myself. It was a reminder (without resorting to the overdone self-care language those with this flavor of anxiety have heard a hundred times before) that I am not defined by my work despite my constant insistence on treating myself as though I am. I can and should be kinder to myself. I needed to hear that."

But the duo\u2019s age doesn\u2019t show at all thanks to an amazing outing \u2013 their first new one in nearly a decade \u2013 that is a gorgeous and expertly crafted example of what PS5 exclusives can look and play like. And even compared to great work building out a universe for Spider-Man , Rift Apart may be Insomniac\u2019s most emotionally resonant game yet. With more touching and clever writing that makes good on the promise of a multi-dimensional trip unlike anything the series has done before, Rift Apart makes old characters fresh and new additions so indelible it\u2019s hard to imagine the series without them. ...Even if \"Ratchet and Clank and Rivet\" would be a pretty long name. Whether you\u2019re new to swinging Ratchet\u2019s wrench or a veteran of the DreadZone, Rift Apart\u2019s mix of third-person shooting and platforming is immediately easy to understand. Ratchet has always been a series about exploration and combat, and thanks to the dip-free stability of the 30fps Fidelity mode, the latter in particular has never felt so good. And while I've only gotten to spend a bit of time with them so far, the Performance and Performance Ray Tracing modes are even smoother at a steady 60fps (watch our Rift Apart Performance Review below for direction comparisons that highlight the differences). I'm completely okay with sacrificing some of the visual effects on my Challenge mode run thanks to how well the higher framerate keeps up with Rift Apart's controlled chaos. That sensation of never slowing down is also thanks to the spectacular load times, which are, as promised, practically nonexistent. Whether you\u2019re jumping through rifts to a new location on the same planet or an entirely different one, or switching characters, I never noticed so much as a hitch, pause, or stutter. Some loads are cleverly hidden behind smart cuts and cutscenes, but for all intents and purposes, Insomniac has delivered a seamless adventure from start to finish. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That\u2019s achieved despite the fact that this is the prettiest PS5 game yet, and one of the best-looking games I\u2019ve ever played. Insomniac has used its cartoony color palette to create a dazzling array of interstellar locations, like the densely packed metropolis of Nefarious City or the lush greenery of Sargasso that benefit from impressive use of ray tracing reflections. Back in the day we used to see \u201cRatchet and Clank looks almost like a Pixar movie\u201d comparisons; with Rift Apart, it has kept pace with much of the work in recent hits like Incredibles 2 and Soul (though Pixar\u2019s pre-rendered animation definitely has an edge in certain scenes). It\u2019s not just the varied vistas that frequently stopped me in my tracks, it\u2019s the little details \u2013 like the gears moving on the familiar Buzz Blade weapon \u2013 and the sheer variety of them. I didn\u2019t know I needed to see Ratchet\u2019s fur in such glorious fidelity, but the more advanced animations and 4K textures allow the entire cast to be more expressive than ever. This is the prettiest PS5 game yet, and one of the best-looking games I\u2019ve ever played. \u201c Rift Apart also gives Pixar a run for its money in its ability to tell an emotional story while also maintaining its excellent comedy. While it\u2019s the funniest game I\u2019ve played in some time, the writing strikes just the right balance between that comedy and the heartfelt, the silly and the sincere. Additionally, it\u2019s not obsessed with referencing past games to the point of alienating newcomers. I can only speculate here due to my own familiarity with the series, but I\u2019d bet that Rift Apart\u2019s best moments will land regardless of your experience with the pair\u2019s previous adventures, especially thanks to the multiverse concept that allows the developers to introduce new takes on familiar characters. It\u2019s through the exploration of the multiverse that we see the debut of Rivet, a playable parallel of Ratchet who proves to be one of Insomniac\u2019s best-written characters ever and yet another memorable performance from voice acting veteran Jennifer Hale (known for female Commander Shepard , among many others). A resistance fighter against Emperor Nefarious in her previously unseen own universe, Rivet is a strong-willed do-gooder, and you can certainly see the shades of Ratchet in her characterization. But Rivet isn\u2019t just a gender-swap; she\u2019s a distinctive personality all her own, with unique wants and hopes, including trust issues that come from years of fighting without a parallel Clank by her side. Where her story goes and how it\u2019s intertwined with Ratchet and Clank\u2019s quickly makes her a vital part of this series\u2019 DNA. While it\u2019s a little disappointing that Rivet doesn\u2019t get her own set of moves, it at least means you don\u2019t have to worry about upgrading and equipping the two protagonists independently when you land on a new planet and are automatically switched from one to the other. Rift Apart has a surprisingly deft approach to dealing with mental health topics. \u201c That\u2019s not to say the headlining duo gets the short end of the intergalactic stick. Ratchet\u2019s internal struggle over whether he actually wants to find the rest of his catlike lombax race looms large, while Clank\u2019s own sense of self-worth in the face of injury is moving. Rift Apart has a surprisingly deft approach to dealing with mental health topics among its entire cast in ways that feel honest and deep, and it\u2019s all wrapped up in this exciting, bright, and bubbly adventure. We\u2019ve gotten hints and teases about the existence of other dimensions before \u2013 with the Dimensionator specifically serving as a cliffhanger from 2013\u2019s Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus \u2013 but Rift Apart makes good on the multiverse idea in hilarious, charming, and even surprisingly touching ways. Sometimes it\u2019s played for laughs, like with alternate-reality takes on existing characters, and other times it\u2019s used in mechanically clever ways, such as when Ratchet or Rivet hop between two versions of the same planet to find pathways that are closed in one dimension are open in another, but also with more danger lying in wait. Pics Or It Didn\u2019t Happen Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart Photo Mode Screenshots 7 Images Rift Apart includes the series\u2019 first-ever photo mode, and after Insomniac\u2019s great work with this option in the Spider-Man games it\u2019s an excellent addition, especially given how beautiful these worlds are. I actually didn\u2019t spend a ton of time with it during my initial playthrough, but that was largely because I knew if I did I may never get around to actually playing. Rift Apart offers beautiful photo op after beautiful photo op, and the customization options \u2013 including changing out armor pieces, adding in light sources, and other standard features \u2013 makes it one of the most robust photo modes out there. The story is told via Rift Apart\u2019s world-by-world approach \u2013 that\u2019s a standard formula for the Ratchet and Clank series, but in this case a lot of work was done to make every planet unique, and each with its own stories and structure that\u2019s distinct from one another. Each world\u2019s story, incidental dialogue, and encounters feel tuned to the personality of whichever lombax you\u2019re controlling there: the furball Sargasso denizens you\u2019ll meet as Rivet are all named Mort and bring with them a kindly American midwest tone and accent to their conversations, while Zurkie's serves as an interstellar crossroads bar and battle arena for travelers like Rivet. Later planets play more with the multiverse idea in some surprising and genre-hopping ways, including one that draws heavily on some of the games Insomniac has made since the last time we saw Ratchet and is executed better than when Naughty Dog tried a similar thing with Uncharted . Each world also has a side quest outside of the main adventure, which allows for a bit more local color to be added and usually some more intriguing platforming sections to pull off. Later planets play more with the multiverse idea in some surprising and genre-hopping ways. \u201c The art direction at large allows the impressive level of detail to remain surprising throughout, thanks to the variety of worlds you\u2019ll explore. Yes, some interiors will share similar metallic, futuristic vibes, and gameplay-relevant surfaces like spots for your gravity boots to stick to will repeat so that they\u2019re instantly recognizable no matter where you go. But every world has its own visual identity that\u2019s a treat to discover, offering different tones, geography, and ensembles of memorable characters. What Visual Mode Will You Use in Rift Apart? Fidelity (4K/30 FPS) Performance Performance Ray Tracing Answer See Results Wacky Weapon Wheel Moment-to-moment gameplay also has new nuances for returning fans to explore. Ratchet and Rivet\u2019s movement has been fine tuned since the 2016 reboot on PS4, and simple additions like a beautifully animated dash move and wallrunning make a world of difference. It not only allows for trickier and more intricate platforming sections and more varied collectible placement, but it brings new nuance to combat as well. The dodge ability allows the lombaxes to phase through incoming attacks, and timing a dash just right to get in close and deal big damage is a consistent new thrill. Timing a dash just right to get in close and deal big damage is a consistent new thrill. \u201c Ratchet can do melee damage with his wrench (and Rivet with her hammer), but in Rift Apart I\u2019ve used his standard weapon a lot less frequently than I did in previous games thanks to the increased scale of battles. In Rift Apart, you need to be more clever with your use of the array of wacky weaponry, and the rifts scattered throughout come in handy for both battles and scouring the environment for collectibles. They\u2019re conveniently placed in most combat arenas to let Ratchet get to higher ground or cross the battlefield, and they saved me more times than I\u2019d care to admit. It\u2019s certainly reminiscent of jumping through a portal in, well, Portal , but the on-screen effect of the new location hurtling toward you coupled with the DualSense \u2019s haptics gives the mechanic its own distinct flair, while adding much more tactical variety to combat than the series has ever seen. It\u2019s never not cool to leap across the battlefield and leave enemies confused in your wake or surprised by your sudden appearance as you gain a momentary upper hand. The best uses of them certainly come during big action moments when rifts hurtle you far greater distances \u2013 namely, from planet to planet while mid-chase or boss fight. It\u2019s especially amusing to come across a later world and realize you saw it for a brief moment while dodging a massive robot\u2019s fists. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart - Every Weapon and Armor Set Revealed So Far 25 Images And Rift Apart\u2019s great arsenal of weapons let you make the most of those opportunities. Even though I miss some of my old series favorites like the Sheepinator and Groovitron, I have to give Rift Apart credit for some instant classics: the Topiary Sprinkler, for instance, transforms enemies into whackable weeds, and the Ricochet shoots a pinball-like pellet at enemies that, properly timed, can deal more damage on subsequent hits. That just scratches the surface of the more than a dozen options, and yet none of them feels redundant or superfluous. Because you\u2019re facing more enemies at a time than in the previous games, and often different combinations of them, I also found myself switching between weapons more than ever before. Yes, I\u2019d gravitate toward my favorites, like the powerful shotgun-like Enforcer, but if you\u2019re not taking advantage of crowd-control options like Mr. Fungi to fend off waves of smaller enemies like the returning Robomutts, or defensive weapons like the intriguing Void Repulsor to block fire from the reptilian Goons-4-Less and their constant barrage of blaster rounds, it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed. That\u2019s especially true when Emperor Nefarious\u2019 massive robotic minions, who shoot various lasers and rapid-fire energy bursts or wield giant mace-like arms, enter the fray. Accessibility Options After the great strides Insomniac made with accessibility options in its Spider-Man games, it\u2019s nice to see an even more varied group of options present in Rift Apart. I am by no means an expert or in the best position to fully know how useful each of these features actually is for those who need them, but the number of visual and audio adjustments you can make, all without affecting completion rates or trophies, is an important inclusion in such a large game. One that feels particularly useful is the ability to allow you to slow the speed of the entire game to make time-sensitive inputs like platforming and combat less frenetic and demanding. There are multiple speed levels to choose from, and it can be turned on and off at will if you only need it for a specific section or fight. For a deeper conversation about what Rift Apart offers, be sure to watch our spoiler-free Podcast Beyond discussion. These weapons are, of course, where you\u2019ll also get the most use out of the DualSense\u2019s haptics. Each weapon\u2019s firepower, from the wild booms of the Enforcer to the short blips of the Burst Pistol, is mirrored in the controller\u2019s advanced rumble. One of the most fun and frequent effects, though, is passing through a rift. As I threw out the rift tether to pull myself through space, the sensation of the rift coming closer to and then surrounding me was always neat in the midst of a battle\u2019s chaos. (The use of the adaptive triggers is a little disappointing \u2013 in the PS5\u2019s first six months , alt-fire for weapons being the difference between a half and full pull has been just about the only real use for them in a combat-heavy experience like this.) The sensation of a rift coming closer to and then surrounding me was always neat. \u201c Naturally, Rift Apart isn\u2019t all combat, as any action-platformer worth its bolts/coins/studs/rings/etc. will find ways to vary up gameplay. However, some of these segments were the only parts of the campaign where I felt the momentum was lost. For instance, there are occasional bits where Ratchet or Rivet have to hitch a ride on a speedy space slug to avoid poisonous waters; it\u2019s amusing the first time or two, but never really becomes anything more than getting from point A to point B. And aerial combat on the back of an intergalactic pterodactyl sounds awesome but it occurs only once and is fairly rudimentary. Neither idea is bad, per se, and they\u2019re only meant to be momentary diversions, but they stand out from the rest of the campaign because they don\u2019t quite match the ingenuity of nearly every other style of gameplay. Which of These PlayStation Series Would You Like to See Revived? Sly Cooper Jak & Daxter Ape Escape Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results To be fair, there are many other twists that fare much better. Clank has several physics-puzzle sections that require you to use the right combination of power orbs to move a series of ethereal Clanks along a pathway and fix interdimensional anomalies. None are particularly difficult to solve, but they quickly and consistently make me feel clever as I find the right path along which to speed up, weigh down, or lift up all these Clank copies as he waxes philosophic with another character about the journey, and his emotional state, so far. There\u2019s also a series of optional pocket dimensions hidden throughout Rift Apart\u2019s worlds which offer clever platforming challenges that will test your timing like little else, and a new battle arena where you can earn some extra upgrades in between story missions. Most of these battles have some amusing twists, too, like limiting you to a specific weapon or introducing a massive column of spinning blades that\u2019s constantly chasing you as you take on other foes. I looked forward to every Glitch sequence because of just how damn endearing their personality is. \u201c But one of my favorite additions is the introduction of Glitch, a spider-like robot whom Ratchet calls on to battle computer viruses, depicted as literal viral blobs and monsters infecting a number of technological pathways. These behind-the-back, third-person shooting sequences are relatively simple and become a bit rote by the end, since you\u2019re limited to either a quick burst fire or a series of more powerful rockets, but I looked forward to every Glitch sequence because of just how damn endearing their personality is. Glitch is neurotically self-aware, anxious, and wary of taking on bad guys, but their journey of self-discovery and finding the confidence to be a valuable team member, nudged along by Ratchet\u2019s encouragement, is positively charming. Rift Apart also includes a set of collectible armor sets that come in three parts, which can be mixed and matched on either Ratchet or Rivet. But more importantly, regardless of whether you ever wear one (which I didn\u2019t for my initial playthrough because I love the base character designs so much), collecting these sets will earn you some welcome stat buffs, like more damage against specific sets of enemies. Gold Bolts are also littered throughout the lands, and each one offers its own set of bonuses, including new photo mode options, weapon cosmetic options, and more. Attaching those rewards to them makes collecting the bolts much more engaging to collect along the journey, rather than just for post-game cleanup. Rift Apart\u2019s standard difficulty is a relatively breezy one. \u201c I eventually finished Rift Apart\u2019s campaign after about 16 hours, having completed 90 percent of everything, including those collectibles . Cleaning up the remainder should only take a couple more hours, but beating the story also unlocks the franchise-stalwart Challenge mode that amps up the difficulty substantially. That\u2019s a good thing, because Rift Apart\u2019s standard difficulty is a relatively breezy one \u2013 I may have died two or three times in battle. That said, I had enough close calls early on to really drive home the benefits of staying mobile, varying up my weapon use, and keeping an eye on ammo. What We Said About Ratchet and Clank (2016) Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years. It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for. - Marty Sliva, April 11, 2016 Score: 9 Read the full Ratchet and Clank 2016 Review The stunning graphics and excellent storytelling of that campaign are backed by Mark Mothersbagh\u2019s great score. It sounds like a cousin of his fantastic Thor: Ragnarok work, mixing familiar franchise themes with new orchestral takes and a series of synth-laden pieces that would have pleased Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Grandmaster. It matches the bombastic action when needed to, but some of my favorite tracks come amidst quieter character or exploration moments. I need it on vinyl, stat. The score never drowns out the bashing, shooting, and quipping that are core to Ratchet\u2019s gameplay, though. And while it all sounds fantastic on a home speaker system, this is yet another PS5 exclusive for which you\u2019ll want 3D-enabled headphones to get the full effect. Walking through Nefarious City, the chatter of passing bots and vehicles can be heard as they go whooshing by, while mid-combat you get a better sense of where every foe and friendly assistant is when you can\u2019t see them. The only truly disappointing aspect is that the 3D audio doesn\u2019t factor into gameplay more often, as the engaging setup led me to expect. There\u2019s a brief mission in Nefarious City that requires you to listen for the thumping beats of Club Nefarious to find your way through the city, and it worked so much better with headphones on. That cool example of integrating audio into gameplay made me want more."

It\u2019s an intense team-based multiplayer take on the grade school sport that combines simple, easy to pick up controls, with deceptively complex tactics and strategies that may be surprising coming from a game featuring this type of Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic. Its crisp, satisfying gameplay and multiplayer duels deliver all of the highs of gym class sports without the smelly uniforms or the anxiety of being picked last. I\u2019ve found the art style to be an acquired taste. The Bratz doll look of the characters was off-putting at first, but taken with the colorful cityscapes, the genre-defying energy of the soundtrack, and eclectic customization options, Knockout City has a charm that\u2019s hard to deny.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The base rules of this sport are simple: your team of three or four has to eliminate the opposing team by clobbering them with balls that spawn across the maps. Players must be hit twice to be knocked out, and the first team to 10 knockouts wins. Every interaction is a matter of having better reflexes and more devious tactics. \u201c When a ball is in your hand, you're almost like a baseball pitcher in that there\u2019s a shot selection aspect to every throw you make as you attempt to break your opponent\u2019s defense, which is a simple yet powerful catch. The basic throw can be charged to a faster variation, you can throw a slow lob that can change the opponent\u2019s timing just enough to throw them off, or you can throw wide curve balls to reach around obstacles and exploit enemy blind spots. Winning a duel is much more about that choice than it is about precision \u2013 since all aim is auto-targeted, having great on-the-run aim like in a traditional third-person shooter is a non-factor. Instead, every interaction is a matter of having better reflexes and more devious tactics in focused, tennis-like volley exchanges. Microtransaction Reaction Knockout City is only sort of free-to-play \u2013 if you want to play past street level 25, you\u2019ll have to drop $20 \u2013 so it may be disconcerting to see that it also has microtransactions. But they're the largely inoffensive kind: everything that can be bought with the in-game currency, holobux, can also be earned by raising your \u201cstreet level.\u201d You gain experience points by simply playing matches, but you\u2019ll gain them in far greater quantities by completing contracts, which have you doing things like taunting the enemy right before you eliminate them. If you\u2019re patient and persistent, you can get every cosmetic Knockout City has to offer without paying more than the sticker price. Among the strangest and most effective moves is ignoring balls completely, and instead turning yourself into one for your teammates to throw. When you \u201cball up\u201d you can be tossed to eliminate opponents like normal, or supercharged to become a sort of living, guided mortar shell. These UItimate Throws cause a devastating explosion on impact, knocking out anyone caught in the blast instantly. Using players as balls is risky, though. You can be caught like any other ball and thrown back against your team, or worse, thrown off the stage for an instant knockout.

I quickly found a favorite stage in Galaxy Burger, which features a circular spinning restaurant that begs you to make wild trick throws inside it. The Roundabout adds cars to the mix, forcing you to stay on the move at all times or get bounced around by rush hour traffic. Of course, not every gimmick becomes something worth playing around, like the transporting tubes in Back Alley Brawl, but they don\u2019t detract from the action either. Knockout City Screenshots 9 Images The special balls that spawn during games have a far more dramatic impact on gameflow from match to match. Sniper balls turn games into more long-range affairs, as players can hang back and launch high speed throws from afar. Multi-balls give you three throws instead of one, turning players into rapid-fire ballers for a limited time. I love that these options are so clearly worth playing around that they can change the pace of a game by their mere presence. For instance, when I hear the ticking of a Bomb Ball, I\u2019m far less likely to stick close to teammates just in case they become ground zero for a sudden explosion. Knockout City\u2019s matchmaking is a bit wonky, though. Especially in unranked Street Play, where I\u2019ve regularly joined games mid match only to find that my whole team has already gone idle, leaving me alone to get walloped by the enemy. Pickup games are at the mercy of the random people you\u2019re playing with, which may not give you a fair shot. Should you need a break from the standard gameplay, Knockout City offers rotating game modes that get shuffled every week that put interesting spins on the rules. One added a sort of gold rush system where every hit causes enemies to drop diamonds that you collect to score instead of simply chasing knockouts. My favorite mode removed all the balls completely, forcing players to throw their teammates at each other instead. Ultimately, these modes are fun distractions but never more alluring than the standard three-versus-three matches for very long."

        "Content": "Emerging from the mists to take the survival crafting genre by storm, much like the viking warriors it draws inspiration from, Valheim manages to spin a formula we've all seen plenty of times into something more like uncharted territory \u2013 even in Early Access. Whether I'm sailing the shimmering seas on my sturdy ship or delving deep into dim dungeons in search of treasure, the challenging combat, endearing art style, and moody soundtrack create a delightful and thrilling world to inhabit. It's guilty of becoming a bit grindy, especially later on, but the rewarding exploration and memorable encounters with its various dangers help give all that busywork meaning. Since even before Minecraft, we\u2019ve done this opening routine countless times: by yourself or with up to nine friends, you cut down trees. You kill some animals. You make new tools so you can cut down trees and kill animals better. This makes it tricky, at first, to tease out why Valheim works so well and stands out so much from the dozens of other games like it. It's a lot of little, subtle things\u2026 and a few not so subtle. Valheim PC Gameplay Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The art and world design are definitely near the top of that list. It has a deliberately lo-fi look with pixelated textures and not a lot of polygons to go around. But even so, it's truly a beautiful game. Every creature, sunbeam, and forested hillside is filled with a sort of fairy tale ambience that made me want to get lost in its procedurally-generated regions. And there's a lot to get lost in, from peaceful meadows to spooky, monster-infested woods to snowy mountains. Every time I generated a new map it impressed me with its scale and how it looked like it could\u2019ve been hand-made. Because of the naturalistic, Northern European feel, it comes across as very cohesive and authentic. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world opens up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. The first time Valheim really made me go \"Wow!\" was when, after about 15 hours of preparing, I set sail on my own hand-built ship. Like a proper viking, your main method of long-distance travel will be taking to the seas and riverways. The controls for steering are kind of clunky, and I love them for that very reason. Mastering the art of making tight turns, plotting a course through dangerous rapids, and managing my speed was oh so satisfying, even if it included some trial and error that did a number on my hull. By the time I had mastered the muscle memory to approach the shoreline at full speed and basically drift to a complete stop, parallel to the beach, right where I wanted to be, I felt like a true master of the briny deep. Realistic waves can bounce you up and down, and a sudden storm can even damage your vessel and force you to make for a safe harbor. The ever-changing direction of the wind is a constant consideration that may encourage you to go out of your way and discover something new rather than simply sail in a straight line. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world is opening up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. Sometimes literally, as the deeper waters are full of danger. Dungeons and Dragons Valheim's larger monsters are very well designed in their simplicity. My first time encountering a troll was a memorable and terrifying experience. Some of my most exciting adventures arose simply from trying to figure out how to get from A to B without being smashed into jam. To reach the second boss arena, because of the way my world was generated, I had to sail up an extremely narrow river that ran between two frigid mountain biomes, which caused me to take constant damage from frostbite. Unfortunately, at the very coldest part of the canyon, I discovered the waterway actually became too narrow for my ship. I leapt out, the winter air chipping at my health bar, and frantically whacked away at the voxel rocks of the riverbed trying to make a canal wide enough to let me pass. And then, from the steep canyon walls above, a troll showed up and smashed my boat to flinders. I had to flee in terror, shivering in my soggy boots, return to my camp on foot (which involved spending a danger-filled night in the wilderness since it was so far away), build a new ship, come back, deal with the troll, finish my canal, and get on my way before I froze solid. None of that was scripted, but Valheim's simple but brilliant world generation made it one of the most memorable experiences I've had in any survival game in a long while \u2013 and it's far from the only tale I have like it! This is an ecosystem that consistently generates campfire-worthy stories with a small number of ingredients. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced. If you hadn't told me it was early access, I probably never would have suspected anything. You're out for your morning hunt and spot a troll. What do you do? Run awaaaaaaaaay! Row out in a boat and kill it with a bow while it can't reach. Square up and fight it head on. Lure it into a pit full of campfires and laugh as it burns. Answer See Results Some of those ingredients are better than others, of course. The nearly-ubiquitous Greydwarves of the Black Forest are an unchallenging annoyance, like flies you have to constantly swat away. I would have liked to snap my fingers and see maybe half of them deleted from existence. Unfortunately, I haven't found any magic space rocks for my gauntlet just yet. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced than this. On the other end of that spectrum are the satisfying, hectic, dramatic boss fights that drive Valheim's progression. These really demonstrate the strengths of its combat: There are five in this early access version, out of a planned nine, and I've taken on four of them in the 40-plus hours I've played so far. Not only do they serve as a climactic capstone to each area and tier of technology, they're really enjoyable and rewardingly difficult to defeat. Each is a major step up in challenge from the last, and the third and fourth bosses feel almost absurd to take on solo. Definitely plan to bring some backup and you\u2019ll have a much better time. The randomized dungeons are also a treat, from bone-strewn viking barrows that reminded me of Skyrim to foreboding crypts that bring to mind the undead areas of the original Dark Souls. You'll need a torch to navigate them, and they're full of monsters, treasure, and crafting materials that you can't get in the overworld. Each one is a nice little break from the sometimes tedious tasks you'd be doing above ground. Back to the Grind As with most survival crafting games, Valheim can get a bit grindy \u2013 sometimes extremely grindy, in fact. Harvesting enough ore or metal scraps to get a new set of gear can literally take real-world days. Some later areas require certain consumables, like poison or frost resistance mead, to even survive in them, meaning you have to do a lot of collecting and brewing every time you want to visit. This cuts both ways, because it serves to make them feel more thrilling and dangerous, but also adds a layer of ticking-clock anxiety and a lot of repetitive prep work to exploration as you watch your mead supply dwindle. Not being able to access a new area because I needed to get stronger to beat up a troll is cool. Not being able to access a new area because I'm waiting on my bees to make more honey? Not so much. Work faster, stupid bees! I really like the way other consumables tie into progression, though. While you can skill up in different weapons and abilities, like running and swimming, your health and stamina meters are completely tied to what's in your belly. This means that \"leveling up\" mostly involves finding new ingredients and learning new recipes to ensure you're always as well fed as you can be. Valheim also wants you to eat a balanced diet. You can benefit from up to three types of food at any time, but stacking more than one of the same thing gives you no benefit. This is really one of Valheim's most clever little tricks for making your character feel more alive and connected to the world, and it sets itself apart from the rote, old-fashioned RPG progression routines where experience translates to levels, which translate into more hit points and energy. There's something really satisfying and thematically appropriate about heading out to battle evil with a full stomach, a good night's rest, and a flagon full of invigorating mead to quaff. And it also avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems in other games: being hungry will never actually kill you or prevent you from being able to hunt and gather. You just won't want to go into battle with anything stronger than a skeleton on an empty stomach. Valheim avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems: it can't actually kill you. Building your own viking village can be a decent way to while away the hours while you wait for those bees. While Valheim is voxel-based, it's also much more limited in how much effect you can have on the terrain than something like Minecraft. You can raise and lower the terrain a certain amount, but it's not very precise. The tool for leveling out an area for building was especially unsatisfying to use, as I never seemed to be able to get a nice, even grade no matter how much I fiddled with it. That means all of my buildings were either floating partly above the ground, or the dirt below would clip through the floorboards in some places. Other than that, the structures you can build are cozy and appropriately Norse. They're assembled from a collection of pre-made pieces that limit your stylistic freedom somewhat, but also make sure the things you build really look like they belong in this world. When you move on to bigger projects, you even have to start thinking about support beams and load-bearing walls, which was a welcome little touch of immersion.

        "Content": "When my wife first saw me playing Monster Train she thought I\u2019d gotten hooked on Slay The Spire again and she\u2019d have to put up with another stretch of me playing it incessantly. I had good news and bad news for her: the good news is that, despite also being a colorful and cartoony game in which you pick new cards and modifier items after every fight to improve your deck, and then spend energy to use those cards in turn-based battle, Monster Train is a very different take on the deck-building roguelike idea. The bad news (again, for her, not for Monster Train) is that it\u2019s every bit as fantastically deep, dynamic, and replayable, and it\u2019s kept me just as engrossed as Slay The Spire ever did.  The most obvious difference is that instead of having just one character attacking and casting spells, Monster Train puts you in command of many creatures \u2013 and they can be summoned onto the first three of your train\u2019s four floors to create an increasingly complex gauntlet for enemies to run through on their way to attack its power source at the top. Why does a train have four floors? That\u2019s\u2026 unclear, as trains are traditionally laid out horizontally. But Monster Train has some very odd lore around it about a quest to restart the fires of Hell that provides some crazy, colorful backdrops for its battles and successfully handwaves away any sort of questions \u2013 such as \u201cWhy is Hell good and Heaven bad now?\u201d \u2013 as not important anyway.   Variety is king in a game like this, and it\u2019s impressive how differently each of Monster Train\u2019s five decks play. The Hellhorned demons are hard-hitting creatures who build up rage to increase their attack power even more; the Melting Remnant relies on cheap, temporary units made of wax that burn out and die after a set number of turns but can be revived even stronger; the ghoulish Umbra depend on summoning and consuming creatures called morsels to strengthen others; Awoken uses a lot of retaliatory spikes and health regeneration on their plant-based units; and the aquatic Stygian Guard specializes in spells and damage over time. The five decks' gameplay differences do a fantastic job of changing up the rules. \u201c All of the monsters are designed in Monster Train\u2019s detailed and cartoony art style that mixes the cheerful and the grotesque, and the mismatched hodgepodge of characters is just fun to look at. (Plus, all the shops along the way are run by weird cats, some of whom appear to be cyborgs.) More importantly, their gameplay differences do a fantastic job of changing up the rules and injecting new variety, based not only on your main deck \u2013 which determines which upgradable champion character you get to summon for free at the start of each match \u2013 but on your secondary deck as well. Monster Train Screenshots 9 Images Because you pick two of those decks to play on each run, right there you have 10 different combinations you can use (many more if you include the fact that swapping the main and secondary will change which champion you\u2019ll use, and you have the option to choose between two champions for each main deck), each with wildly different synergies between their abilities. You can, for example, feed morsels to demons to make them stronger or use the Melting Remant\u2019s revival abilities on any other faction\u2019s units, creating combos so powerful they seem broken \u2013 at first. Every time you defeat the final boss (a successful run takes around an hour) the challenge ramps up (unless you don\u2019t want it to), to the point where anything less than a super-powered build will give you a snowball\u2019s chance in Hell. The more I experimented and learned, the more I was rewarded with a nuanced understanding of how to maximize a deck\u2019s potential. Each deck combo has wildly different synergies between their abilities. \u201c Monster Train does lean a bit harder on randomness than Slay The Spire in that even most of your starter deck is randomized on each run and your chosen champion\u2019s upgrade path is narrowed to two of their three overall possibilities. That can be a little frustrating in that it occasionally results in a run where I feel the odds are unfairly stacked against me, but it also means that sometimes I unexpectedly come back from what appeared to be a bad situation. Best Game Where You Play As the Bad Guy? Prototype Tropico Wario Land Any Grand Theft Auto Shadow of the Colossus Destroy All Humans! Spec Ops: The Line Other (Tell us in the comments!) Answer See Results You can usually make lemonade out of lemons if you think carefully about which of the random selections of cards and artifacts you\u2019re presented with to choose, as well as the simple either-or choices of which of two tracks to take on the overworld map that\u2019ll take you, for example, either a unit upgrade shop, a health pick-up, and a random new artifact or a spell upgrade shop, a free new modifier artifact, and the opportunity to duplicate any card other than your champion. These choices can dramatically change how you play and force you to change your plans and adapt, or pivot to a new opportunity you hadn\u2019t anticipated instead of following the same playbook each time. These choices can dramatically change how you play and force you to adapt. \u201c Even the very first artifact you choose from the two options presented will have immediate and far-reaching effects that define your run. Maybe your four Train Stewards (basic, torch-headed soldiers every deck gets by default) are suddenly made much more powerful; Maybe enemies take damage every time they progress from one floor to the next, effectively negating basic units; Maybe you get +7 action points on your first turn, so you can build your deck to summon extremely powerful units if you draw them on that round. There are dozens of these options to find, and many are literal game-changers. All 2021 Games With Confirmed Release Dates 39 Images Monster Train emphasizes tactics more than Slay The Spire because while the order of what spells you cast and units you place is always crucial in this type of game, here you also have to think about positioning across three floors at once (you can\u2019t place units in the Pyre room at the top). Normally, the first unit in a row will take the burnt of the damage until they die and the guys in the rear are protected \u2013 unless the enemy has a Sweep modifier that allows it to attack all your troops at once. A lot of abilities, like the Armor Imp\u2019s power to give an ally some protective armor, only affect the first unit in line, so you want to make sure your troops are lined up to take the greatest advantage of that. You also have to consider that, by default, all of the enemy units will attack first, which means you generally have to consider defense before offense \u2013 a unit with strong attack but weak defense won\u2019t survive to make use of that attack unless it\u2019s protected. But that\u2019s upended if you have a unit with the Quick modifier, letting them strike first and opening up new strategies.  Monster Train emphasizes tactics more than Slay The Spire. \u201c Pretty much anything your units can do the enemy can do as well, which leads to a wide variety of weird \u201cheavenly\u201d creatures (who often appear just as demonic as anything from Hell) to fight against and weaknesses to exploit. Each battle culminates in a fight against a boss who first harasses you and supports their attacking units by moving between the three floors and casting buffs and attacks before joining the fight directly and locking off floors as they clear them. They, too, have random modifiers, so even though Monster Train tells you what bosses you\u2019ll face in advance you still won\u2019t be able to fully anticipate their moves until the battle is joined.   Now on Xbox Game Pass  Monster Train is so great it's been nominated for IGN's PC Exclusive Game of the Year for 2020 , but then it surprise-launched on Xbox on December 16 and is included in Xbox Game Pass . Check out some of our other favorites on Microsoft's all-you-can-eat subscription service:   It can take a while to watch fights play out as your units and the enemy take turns hacking away at each other \u2013 especially when you already know you\u2019re going to lose, because there are no surprises if you work out the math in you head before you end your turn \u2013 but thankfully there\u2019s a setting in the menus to accelerate the pace at which that plays out. I had far more fun trying things out for myself and learning as I went than I would've looking them up. \u201c Honestly, there are far too many of these choices for me to detail them all without turning this review into an instruction manual. Suffice it to say that at just about every point you\u2019re making important decisions, and they all have to be weighed carefully because you can never be sure what\u2019s coming next. And while you certainly can consult the vast and detailed wikis and guide videos instructing you on how to use everything, I had far more fun trying things out for myself and learning as I went. The selection of battle music is great, too \u2013 the fact that I\u2019ve never felt the urge to turn it off after dozens of hours played is a testament to that. Best Strategy/Tactics Games of 2020 6 Images I will say that because Monster Train only saves at the start and end of each battle rather than after each turn it\u2019s a little too easy to game the roguelike nature of it \u2013 a problem admittedly shared by Slay the Spire as well. Once I figured out that if my fingers slip and accidentally hit alt-F4 when I\u2019m about to lose a battle the clock will be turned back when I reopen it, swallowing a defeat became much harder. But that\u2019s kind of a me problem, isn\u2019t it? If, somehow, you become tired of the normal runs, Monster Train has lots and lots of optional modifiers to make it easier or harder (such as playing without a champion or allowing you to place more units on every floor) plus daily challenges and asynchronous multiplayer where everybody competes for score with the same modifiers, and more. Once it got its hooks into me, Monster Train felt almost bottomless... and that was before the developer, Shiny Shoe, started adding new content. That\u2019s been coming at a pace where if you put it down for a while and come back, there\u2019ll probably be something new to try. "

        "Content": "Editor's Note: We've replaced the video version of this review with one that uses gameplay footage recorded on the PC build of Cyberpunk 2077, instead of the trailers we had to use previously due to CD Projekt Red's pre-release restrictions. The content of the review itself is identical, but the gameplay now more closely represents the experience we had while playing. Editor's Note 2:Due to the dramatic difference in performance, we've given a separate review score to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Cyberpunk 2077 . We do not recommend it on those platforms at this time. In my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn\u2019t without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves \u2013 optional or not \u2013 and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I\u2019ve played in recent years. You\u2019re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass \u2013 even if, to be blunt, Reeves\u2019 stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny\u2019s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Patches Since Launch Updated 2/4/21 Since publishing this review, CD Projekt Red has released multiple patches attempting to improve the performance of Cyberpunk 2077 and fix bugs. Multiple smaller updates were released closer to release, including the 1.06 patch we took a deep look at hare , with the larger 1.1 patch arriving more recently . Additionally, CDPR stated that next-gen versions are aimed for release in the second half of 2021. It\u2019s worth noting that the 1.1 update inadvertently introduced a different game breaking bug that quickly needed to be patched out as well, so while improvements are certainly being made issues haven\u2019t gone entirely gone away. You can find a full 1.1 performance analysis here for an in-depth look at how these patches have changed the state of Cyberpunk 2077 at the time of this update. Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s slow burn of an intro \u2013 it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time \u2013 I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V\u2019s struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City ; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no one\u2019s going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble \u2013 and from the early hours you\u2019ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time. The structure here feels very different from many RPGs I\u2019ve played, including CD Projekt Red\u2019s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you don\u2019t have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often don\u2019t even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there\u2019s so much to see and do \u2013 and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out \u2013 that I didn\u2019t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice. The intro did an incredible job of getting me invested in V and Johnny\u2019s struggle. \u201c And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won\u2019t get that \u201cwow\u201d feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it \u2013 for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered there\u2019s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. You\u2019ll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer \u2013 from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them \u2013 is frequently rewarding on its own. Cyberpunk 2077 PC Gameplay Screenshots 42 Images In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means you\u2019ll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There\u2019s some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you\u2019re constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I won\u2019t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions. Divergent Paths Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly you\u2019ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don\u2019t let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. It\u2019s frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make \u2013 choice in dialogue options, how to build your character , how to approach missions, and beyond. I\u2019d frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if I\u2019d done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both V\u2019s own story and those of the characters around them. At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone else\u2019s game where they\u2019d picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn\u2019t even offered to another player because of a single decision we\u2019d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I\u2019d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation. Don\u2019t let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and through. \u201c The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark . I don\u2019t want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like \u201cMILFguard\u201d (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher\u2019s Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in. The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPR\u2019s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one) \u2013 and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you\u2019ll get in the end. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a Rorschach Test. \u201c This is the crux of what\u2019s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It\u2019s not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: it\u2019s a Rorschach Test. It\u2019s shorter than the epic-length quest you might\u2019ve expected, but with an amount of variation that\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what you\u2019re going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player. That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it\u2019s organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny\u2019s story than others. It\u2019s primarily broken into \u201c Main Jobs \u201d that are required to progress, \u201cGigs\u201d that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a \u201c Side Jobs \u201d category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What\u2019s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings. Does hearing Cyberpunk 2077 can be \"beaten\" in about 20 hours make you more or less interested in playing? More Less No change Answer See Results Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of V\u2019s journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that. Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times \u2013 like you\u2019re playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V\u2019s journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of V\u2019s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural. Blade Gunner While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn\u2019t any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes , and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if you\u2019re planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (I\u2019m not sure why, but let\u2019s just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown. Every CD Projekt Red Review 13 Images What\u2019s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you can\u2019t bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you don\u2019t invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use \u2013 so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize you\u2019re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you\u2019ve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have. Combat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete control over the choreography. \u201c Combat itself is another aspect where you\u2019ll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn\u2019t in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting. What's the Deal With PS5 and Series X Versions? I've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year. I wouldn\u2019t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It\u2019s not the most complex dance in the world, but it\u2019s one I felt I had complete control over choreographing. I also love Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot \u2013 things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or\u2026 a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff . The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in V\u2019s apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use \u2013 though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons I\u2019ve found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap. The soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially stands out. \u201c Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn\u2019t much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way. What's more important to an open-world RPG? A great main quest Great side quests Answer See Results Quickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my V\u2019s high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out. When things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone. Bugs in the System Unfortunately, the amount of bugs I\u2019ve experienced really does need to be mentioned. I\u2019ve only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues I\u2019ve encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as you\u2019d hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions \u2013 but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me. I\u2019ve had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. I\u2019d frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. I\u2019ve had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful. Cyberpunk 2077 - Examples of Visual Bugs 9 Images A day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance \u2013 which is always good, but frankly those aren\u2019t the issues that\u2019ve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today. Just to restate, a word of warning: we haven\u2019t been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all \u2013 not on the new-gen systems or the old. While I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues I\u2019ve seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what it\u2019ll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If that\u2019s where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision.

        "Content": "If there\u2019s one thing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild fans want, it\u2019s more Breath of the Wild, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is here to give us\u2026 something kinda like that. Like the previous Hyrule Warriors games , this is Zelda as seen through a Dynasty Warriors lens, but the key difference here is that Age of Calamity\u2019s premise takes us back to the events of The Great Calamity referenced throughout Breath of the Wild . This is the story of the Champions, of Zelda\u2019s struggle to awaken her power, and of the resurrection of Ganon. The resulting game is a great fit for Koei Tecmo\u2019s famous 1 vs 1000 gameplay, and also a fun new spin on a much-loved world. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity really does feel like a love letter to Breath of the Wild. It goes out of its way to include as many of the signature elements of that game as it can, from the bestiary and Sheikah powers, through to cooking, Koroks , clothing options and paragliding, and they really set the tone \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Age of Calamity is packed with systems, mechanics, locations, and Easter eggs pulled from its predecessor, and coming across these is a joy. Of course Link can shield surf ! Or parry Guardian lasers. And why shouldn\u2019t he wield tree branches, soup ladles, and mops as weapons? And why not cast Magnesis to yank treasure chests out of the ground or use an Octorok to polish up rusty weapons? And what could be more normal than tuning the Sheikah Sensor to find ingredients across the map? My more than 40 hours with Age of Calamity were filled with moments in which Koei Tecmo\u2019s reverence for the source material was abundantly clear. Age of Calamity is able to expand upon this world in a number of areas too. There\u2019s a large cast of playable characters for one, letting you get a sense for how deadly Impa was as a young woman, or how skilled the Champions were in battle during their prime. We even get to pilot the Divine Beasts, and while these missions aren\u2019t actually all that exciting, they\u2019re still a good palate cleanser, as well as an effective way to bring Breath of the Wild\u2019s backstory to life, and to make these lumbering titans feel more real than they ever did before. Age of Calamity really does feel like a love letter to Breath of the Wild. Perhaps the most significant new twist, however, is also likely to be the most divisive. The opening cutscene introduces us to a miniature Guardian who comes alive at the moment Zelda \u2019s powers awaken \u2013 when all hope is lost \u2013 and then travels back in time to warn the heroes about what is to come. Now, the Guardian itself is adorable, sure, but the time-traveling motif naturally raises the question of whether this prequel will follow the events as described in Breath of the Wild, or whether it will create its own timeline by altering the past. I\u2019m not going to directly answer that question here, as the story should be yours to discover, but what I will say is that while many events transpire , and there\u2019s plenty of high-stakes drama, the actual characterisation along the way is pretty lacking. Zelda, for instance, spends a big chunk of the time playing the one note she played in most of the memories in Breath of the Wild \u2013 namely, self-doubt that she\u2019ll ever unlock her power and be useful. It\u2019s disappointing that she\u2019s played so straight when this was an opportunity to do more with, well, all of the main characters, actually. This is especially awkward because in battle, Zelda is a straight-up brawler \u2013 she wields the Sheikah Slate as her primary weapon , and yet, this badass killing machine is still meek, bookish, and lacking confidence as far as the story is concerned. There\u2019s even an escort mission in which she can\u2019t fight, despite the fact that \u2013 mere moments earlier \u2013 she was slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, and everything else Hyrule\u2019s got. If Age of Calamity can toss a time-travelling Guardian into the mix, surely it could\u2019ve done a little more with Zelda, too? Another way to look at it is that Breath of the Wild\u2019s story was disjointed by design \u2013 you pieced it together as you came across memories and other flashbacks, whereas here we have a storyline that runs from start to finish, yet still doesn\u2019t really tell us anything meaningful about its characters. None of this should really be a surprise, though, because Age of Calamity is not trying to be a Final Fantasy game. Big events are often delivered through narrated text on-screen (with some pretty questionable voice acting), while the cutscenes are largely just brief interludes that help keep the story going, or show off something cool. The primary purpose of the overarching story really is to provide a backbone for ever-evolving gameplay across the dozens of hours of Age of Calamity. And in this capacity it serves its purpose admirably. Impa Slap While I\u2019d have liked a little more insight into the characters, the Rock Roast of this game really is its combat. The foundation is deliberately simple, with every character having an array of different combos based around regular attacks transitioning into strong attacks, as well as a unique central mechanic. Impa, for instance, uses ZR to place symbols on enemies which she can then absorb with strong attacks to create mirror images of herself. Absorb three symbols and she\u2019s at full power, with a line of clones fighting to either side of her. Impa can feel absurdly powerful in this state, spraying a barrage of blades at anyone in even the vaguest of vicinities. This feeling of power only grows as you upgrade her weapons and start to take advantage of seals \u2013 weapon augmentations \u2013 that suit her play style. Impa can feel absurdly powerful... spraying a barrage of blades at anyone in even the vaguest of vicinities. What\u2019s impressive is that every character in the roster is this distinct. Urbosa, for instance, has a lightning gauge which can be channeled \u2013 one segment at a time \u2013 into extra-powerful strong attacks in her combos. Her fighting style is very much like a dance, and I love how she balances elegant, contained moves with outright devastation. Her lightning gauge is instantly refilled after using a weak-point smash too, allowing you to chain together shockingly effective sequences of moves. Mipha, meanwhile, literally swims around the battlefield, and her key mechanic lets her close the distance to enemies by bursting from fountains, then juggle them in the air before launching them again with another fountain, and so on. Seals that do extra damage to airborne enemies work well for Mipha's tridents. Who is your favorite BotW Champion? Urbosa Daruk Mipha Revali Can't I just vote for Tingle? Answer See Results I\u2019d love to also tell you about some of the insane characters you\u2019ll unlock later on, but that would be spoiler territory, so instead I\u2019ll just say: woah . Age of Calamity has some awesome surprises and some truly deep cuts that fans are really going to love. They don\u2019t all land \u2013 some characters are more intuitive to use and more robust in design than others \u2013 but still, the overall roster is a lot of fun. Coming back to what we can discuss, Link is perhaps the most traditional character, but he also offers up the most variety: he boasts different combos, special attacks, and ZR mechanics based on the weapon type he\u2019s using \u2013 sword and shield, spear, or the two-handed weapon category. Sword and shield, for instance, opens up parrying, shield surfing, and a rapid-fire bow, whereas two-handed weapons let him sacrifice some of his own health to juice up attacks. He\u2019s a powerhouse. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity - Screenshots and Art 41 Images Stasis a While and Listen Of course, these are just a few of the ingredients going into this mighty combat stew. Every playable character can also use four Sheikah runes \u2013 Stasis, Cryonis, Magnesis and Remote Bombs \u2013 with a unique implementation for each character. Link uses his Cryonis block as a launcher, for instance, while Impa rides hers around like some kind of ultra-compact ice car. It\u2019s fun seeing how each has been realised in-game. The runes\u2019 role in combat is less freewheeling than you might expect them to be, however, as each boss \u2013 including area bosses \u2013 clearly signposts when to use a particular rune against them. It\u2019s not enough for a big Bokoblin to be holding a shield in front of its body \u2013 you\u2019ll also get an unmissable bomb icon telling you explosives are the way to break its guard. This happens in basically every combat encounter and, to be fair, is a wise move for a game that\u2019s aiming to be broadly accessible. Age of Calamity\u2019s combat isn\u2019t meant to be punishing, after all, it\u2019s meant to be empowering fun. The main issue for me is that all of this hand-holding discouraged me from experimenting and using my runes at other times, as I didn\u2019t want to get caught out needing to counter an attack while the ability recharged. That said, there are some instances in which it makes sense to proactively use rune powers. Any time you\u2019re able to open an enemy up to chip away at its weak-point gauge, for instance, you can use Stasis to give yourself the opportunity to whittle it down further. And against any enemy with a weak-point gauge that\u2019s very much your priority, as eliminating the gauge lets you execute a weak-point smash attack which will one-shot most area bosses and do a major chunk of damage to anything tougher. It would have been nice if all the rune powers had a similarly strategic impact, but generally speaking they\u2019re used reactively. Every IGN Zelda Review Score 23 Images Elemental powers, on the other hand, work in much the same way as they did in Breath of the Wild. If you\u2019re facing a Fire Moblin (yes, there are more enemy variants now), using an Ice Rod is going to be super effective, whereas waggling a Fire Rod in its direction will tickle it at best. And of course you can do things like target a metal crate with a Lightning Rod to amplify the area of effect. It\u2019s good to see these kinds of interactions return. Perhaps the most critical part of why the combat feels good, however, is Age of Calamity\u2019s implementation of dodging. Being able to lock on to larger enemies then dodge away from their attacks is a big part of what gives the action its sense of speed, letting you dance around the outside of a massive enemy or go straight at Lynels, confident you can evade their Savage Lynel Swords. And best of all, if you dodge at the right time you\u2019ll trigger a Flurry Rush that gives you an opening to take a big chunk off the opponent\u2019s weak-point gauge. In Age of Calamity, dodging \u2013 and by extension the Flurry Rush \u2013 is king. Many of the most thrilling missions double down on the fast-paced combat by putting you on the clock. Many of the most thrilling missions double down on the fast-paced combat by putting you on the clock. There\u2019s a real sense of urgency when you know you need to capture a certain number of outposts or take down a certain set of powerful enemies within a limited time. In these missions you\u2019re not bothering with the cannon fodder or scouring the corners of the map for Koroks or treasure chests. Instead, you\u2019re bee-lining for your objective, entirely focused on dodging attacks and finding ways to whittle down those crucial weak-point gauges. Often you\u2019re also dispatching allies to the other key points on the map so that you can switch directly from one objective to another. Combat can be a little rough around the edges, however. The camera isn\u2019t always helpful and sometimes loses the action completely. And while Age of Calamity generally feels fast and responsive, the frame rate can vary a bit, and this is even more noticeable in splitscreen co-op, where the game\u2019s gorgeous visual style also takes a significant hit. It\u2019s a real shame Koei Tecmo didn\u2019t allow for online co-op. On the Level Age of Calamity can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Aside from the broad difficulty settings, you have the freedom to attempt missions while you\u2019re under the recommended level, or conversely, only ever attempt missions once you\u2019re well above. There are so many missions that unlock over the course of the campaign that I almost never found myself having to grind to hit a certain level. In fact, the times I repeated missions were for specific drops or enemy trophies to help me complete subquests across the map. The vast majority of the time I was doing new missions. I really like the way the progression system is structured, too. You can pay to level up allies if need be, but a character\u2019s level is obviously only part of the picture. Completing more missions with a character means you\u2019ll get more weapon drops for them, and spare weapons can be fused onto your existing weapon to make it more powerful and add additional perks via the seal system. And no, your weapons will never break \u2013 not even if it\u2019s a tree branch. Spare weapons can be fused onto your existing weapon to make it more powerful and add additional perks via the seal system. I\u2019m also a fan of how cooking has been implemented in Age of Calamity. Recipes are unlocked, as opposed to discovered through experimentation, but if you have all the ingredients you\u2019re able to cook one or more meals before every mission, and this opens up a whole host of possibilities. If you\u2019re slightly under-leveled you might want to stack on attack power or reduce damage taken. If you know you\u2019ll be facing a series of bosses you may want to widen the timing window for triggering Flurry Rushes. Perhaps you just want as much XP as you can get. Or bonus rupees . There are so many options, and sometimes making Dubious Food  is absolutely the right choice. Age of Calamity really does offer a wealth of content. All the way through the main story I was steadily unlocking new characters, revealing more missions, gaining access to more services and perks, seeing new weapon seals pop up, and upgrading my roster with more combos, more hearts, stronger powers, and so on. At no point did I hit a wall; instead I was always making progress, and always having fun. And even now, with the main story complete, my journey still isn\u2019t over because there\u2019s so much left to do.

Insomniac\u2019s original Spidey tale is still a great Peter Parker adventure, even with a new face, featuring a great clash between the lives Peter leads both behind and out of his mask. And yes, it\u2019s certainly jarring at first to see that face appear instead of the PS4 version, but I pretty quickly grew accustomed to this new look. Now I\u2019ve come to like it more than the original. It looks more age-appropriate and more in line with the boyish but confident charm of Yuri Lowenthal\u2019s memorable performance. His take on Peter still stands tall as one of my favorites, buoyed by Laura Bailey\u2019s still-wonderful Mary-Jane, William Salyers\u2019 broken Otto Octavius, and more. Re-experiencing Insomniac\u2019s story has delighted me as much as it did the first time around, particularly in the wonderful first moments of Peter and Mary-Jane on screen together, Spider-Man\u2019s friendship with Yuri Watanabe, and some of the bigger personalities of Peter\u2019s foes. Improved facial animations, less plastic-y skin, and realistic hair tech add more realism to the chemistry between Peter and MJ, with a satisfied smirk betraying Peter\u2019s hope that they\u2019ll get back together, as well as the despair Otto experiences when his lab is shut down. It\u2019s a big step up.   Looking Back: What We Said About Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 \"I was left delighted at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is an excellent set of webswinging mechanics, which -- combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense sequences. Insomniac\u2019s first foray into the realm of Marvel superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world and combat are only occasionally caught up in a web of overly familiar trappings.\"  Characters benefit from the re-done lighting system, and so does everything else it touches. From beautiful moments at dusk as the sun fades, to indoor interiors of Fisk Tower using the building\u2019s many modern light fixtures to more realistically brighten the space, everything just looks more beautiful. And married with ray traced reflections in the fidelity mode, New York comes alive in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible on the PS4. I mean seriously: it has turned one of Spider-Man\u2019s most common tasks, stopping a car chase, into a beautiful light show of neon signs reflecting off cars and buildings as I chased the thieves and webbed them up all through the city. It\u2019s as shiny and bright as strolling through Times Square at 2AM actually is, all without the real-life headache you probably have...if you\u2019re strolling through Times Square at 2AM. The DualSense is used pretty much exactly as it is in Miles Morales, which is excellent in helping to translate the sensation of playing as Spider-Man in more detail than ever before. I may never get the sensation of webslinging in real-life, but the DualSense\u2019s haptic vibrations, trigger resistance, and a subtle \u201cthwip\u201d from the controller\u2019s speaker do an admirable job of recreating what I imagine it\u2019d be like. Likewise, if you have a 3D audio headset like the Pulse 3D, you get a nice extra level of immersion as the sounds of sirens go by in the distance and angry New Yorkers tell you to watch where you\u2019re going as you run by on street level. But of course, my soundbar still does a perfectly good job of capturing the layered sounds of Insomniac\u2019s New York as I swing through the streets. Do You Like Peter's New Face? Yes, more than the original Yes, but not more than the original No, I prefer the 2018 model Indifferent, it's under a mask most of the time Answer See Results Even if you\u2019ve already beaten or even platinumed it on PS4, I\u2019d recommend checking out how much more vibrant Insomniac\u2019s New York City is. It\u2019s a different time of year than Miles Morales\u2019 Christmas setting, so it offers a different enough visual palette even though I\u2019d just played that game. And all the fun of the gameplay is still there: Peter\u2019s swinging and acrobatic combat flows just as well as I remember, and even more smoothly now when you choose the new 60fps performance mode (which sacrifices some of the nicer lighting effects). I still find myself leaning heavily toward my few suit mod preferences and the side missions aren\u2019t any more diverse \u2013 I\u2019ve already run into what feels like a few dozen muggings \u2013 but that\u2019s remasters for you. The remaster also has all the benefits of bundling all three DLC episodes of The City That Never Sleeps. That\u2019s another 10 or so hours of play, and it adds a largely satisfying comic book mini-arc that includes fantastic character work with Black Cat and Silver Sable. You take the bad with the good in the form of the annoying Screwball missions and a less-than-stellar second chapter, but these episodes work much better together than they did as separate episodes released a month apart as they were originally. Anyone can wear the mask, and it\u2019s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy into its games. \u201c On top of that and the free suits Insomniac put out, the remastered edition has been enhanced with quality-of-life improvements, like the near-instantaneous load times on PS5, and even additions to Photo Mode to mirror the handy new lighting features of Miles\u2019 version. Plus, Miles Morales\u2019 huge suite of accessibility features have been added (something I\u2019m kicking myself for neglecting to mention in my Miles review). There are options to change the contrast of the environment, enemy readability, quick-time event requirements, and much more. It\u2019s a nice step up from the original\u2019s included options. And if recent Spider-verse stories have taught us anything, it\u2019s that anyone can wear the mask, and it\u2019s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy into its games."

        "Content": "Miles Morales may just be finding his footing as a superhero, but his first solo game proves developer Insomniac has comfortably hit its stride as it converts its stand-alone hit into a series. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a flashy starring debut for Miles, telling as engaging a story as the original Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man while simultaneously improving upon pretty much every minor gripe I had with that already great game. It may be smaller overall, but every facet of it feels more essential: the incredible swinging mechanics, storytelling, and animation of Peter Parker\u2019s adventure return, joined by meaningful updates to side missions, Miles\u2019 flashy new moves, and the captivating spirit of New York City. While it can be played on PlayStation 4, this is a gorgeous introduction to the PlayStation 5 . Miles Morales takes advantage of improved lighting and particle effects to make this former New Yorker achingly miss the city I once called home, and swinging feels even better at 60fps than at 30. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man established Miles\u2019 role alongside Peter Parker, and this solo outing makes it clear just how much room there is in Manhattan for multiple Spider-Men to shine. Actor Nadji Jeter returns to the title role and gives the newly heroic Miles a sincerity, heart, and excitement that stands tall alongside other depictions out there \u2013 from the Oscar-winning Into the Spider-Verse animated movie, to the original Brian Michael Bendis/Sara Pichelli comic run, and the ongoing Saladin Ahmed comic arc. This version stays true to Miles\u2019 best stories in other mediums \u2013 mostly, he just wants to do right by Peter, his family, and his friends \u2013 while also making this take on the character feel fresh with something new to say. Insomniac's Miles stands tall alongside other depictions out there.That, in part, comes from Miles discovering his way around his new home neighborhood of Harlem, both in and out of the suit. Spider-Man: Miles Morales follows in the smart storytelling footsteps of the original game (and many of the best Spider-Man stories) by making sure the events of life underneath the mask come head-to-head with the webhead\u2019s trials and tribulations. And while on a gameplay level you\u2019re free to explore the full map (which returns largely unchanged from Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man) much of the story itself is rooted in or inevitably returns us to Harlem. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Review Screenshots 22 Images Peter had his apartment and Doctor Octavius\u2019 lab, but his connections to the city often boiled down to specific characters like Mary-Jane or villains like Doc Ock and Vulture. Miles, on the other hand gets to keep coming back home as a teenager living with his mom during the holidays would. We get to know his whole apartment, as well as the neighboring blocks around him as familiar shopkeeps pop up in side missions and the main story. And with militaristic tech conglomerate Roxxon building a new plaza HQ in Harlem, this welcoming home neighborhood becomes the center of an engaging struggle as it fights to maintain its identity in the face of corporate takeover. Miles Morales more than lives up to that high bar set by Marvel's Spider-Man. Peter\u2019s story did a fantastic job of making his personal stakes as important as the bombastic superhero action, and Miles Morales more than lives up to that high bar. Having his best friend, Ganke, in on his secret identity allows for some amusing chats while Miles is out on missions; his mother\u2019s political ambitions conflicting with Roxxon and the mysterious Underground faction ratchet up the tensions; and that repeated return to Harlem made me care about the neighborhood I visited least in the first game. Hell, Insomniac even finds some interesting new ground with Miles\u2019 relationship with his uncle, Aaron Davis, even though their connection in the recent comics and Spider-Verse lingers fresh in my mind. Every IGN Spider-Man Review Ever 34 Images As you explore the city, Miles Morales uses the same trick as the first game to flesh out Miles\u2019 backstory, but to an even more investing degree. A host of time capsules from when Miles was younger offer a peek at his friendships and school life growing up, while an audio-focused collectible shines new light on his family. It\u2019s an idea that feels born out of Miles as a character rather than a need to fill out the world, leading to some quite touching moments outside of the main story. (Also see What Spider Man: Miles Morales Gets Right About Cultura and the Authentic Puerto Rican Experience ). The anticipation of seeing where this series goes next is a thrill in of itself.Miles is fallible because he\u2019s so new to the gig, and the story doesn\u2019t shy away from his mistakes, like how his interactions with a personal friend can have big ramifications for his superhero alter-ego \u2013 but it also continuously shows how working toward something better is a process, one that is stronger when built on trust and community. I won\u2019t spoil where any of the story takes Miles and his impressive supporting cast, but it\u2019s a stirring and gripping Spidey tale that left me with goosebumps in its final moments, and the anticipation of seeing where this series goes next is a thrill in of itself.

Insomniac has found creative ways to work within the same overall setting of the original while not retreading too much of the same ground. Epic showdowns that send sparks flying, between new tech from the Tinkerer\u2019s purples, Roxxon\u2019s reds, and Miles\u2019 own yellow bioelectricity offer beautiful, thrilling battles that range from boss fights that continue the first game\u2019s strong tradition of memorable showdowns to street-level brawls that put Miles\u2019 enhanced attacks to the test. Purchasing Guide Spider-Man Miles Morales is available for purchase for $49.99 and the Ultimate Edition is $69.99 . For full stock details PS5 consoles, accessories and games check out our launch day buyer's guide . What\u2019s Up, Danger? Slipping back into the swinging and fighting mechanics of Miles Morales was as comfortable as it was exhilarating. Miles controls largely the same as Peter when it comes to the basics: R2 to swing, L2 + R2 to zip to specific points, square to attack, circle to dodge, and triangle for a distance closing web pull. But beyond those fundamentals and some comparable moves, Insomniac has done a flat-out fantastic job of adding depth to Miles\u2019 movement and fighting skills to allow him to stand out as his own character instead of feeling like another cosmetic reskin. On the animation side, watching the less-experienced Miles less delicately swing through the city is a treat. He\u2019ll occasionally spin around on his own web to reorient himself, but he\u2019s also got a style Peter can\u2019t match, including the coolest jumping-off-a-roof animation I can remember from any iteration of Spider-Man. Bioelectrical attacks offer more variety to combat, and look super cool every time you use them. On the combat side, Miles\u2019 has a few new tricks that mix up the fun \u2013 as do enemies. On the one hand there\u2019s Miles\u2019 bioelectricity, which is largely executed with L1 + a combo of face buttons. After charging a meter in combat, Miles can unleash temporarily paralyzing bursts of current that pack a wallop. Some of these Venom attacks (no relation to the symbiote guy)  focus on one foe, while others allow for crowd control, and yet more can help get an air combo going while warding off enemies. Mixing them in with Miles\u2019 basics attacks not only saved me in the midst of a packed battle, but also adds so much stylish flair and variety to how I approached brawls. Those abilities also bring about one of the more fun uses of the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller, as the crinkle of electricity discharging around Miles is simulated via its haptic feedback. You can hold down L1 to prep an attack and start to feel the rumble, while initiating a Venom-ified right hook will send a rumble from the left side of the controller through to the right. And Venom-infused takedown animations are beautiful, with electricity sparking and bouncing around Miles and foes in gorgeous fashion. Feeling the DualSense Speaking of DualSense, Spider-Man Miles Morales was my first fully fledged game where I got to use Sony\u2019s new-gen controller and all its new bells and whistles. What excited me most turned out to be the small touches that elevated a scene, or helped root me to a specific location or emotional moment. Take the opening, for example: Miles is on a subway line to get to Harlem, and the thump of the train as it rattles along the tracks rhythmically pulses down the controller as Miles\u2019 traincar approaches its stop. When Miles gets a text, his phone is in his right pocket, so only the right half of the controller buzzes. Little moments like this aren\u2019t necessarily flashy, unbelievable or even essential uses of the controller\u2019s technology, but it instantly has me excited for the potential of story-focused games to offer further immersion through the DualSense. Another aspect that sets Miles apart is his cloaking ability, which allows him to become invisible for short bursts of time (a power tied to another meter). It can be used in the middle of a fight to confuse enemies or let you slip away to safety for a moment when things get dire. It\u2019s also, naturally, a huge help if you choose to approach a scenario more stealthily. There\u2019s nothing worse in a stealth combat section than being accidentally spotted by an enemy, and Miles\u2019 invisibility can give you the time and space to react to compensate for the fact that you don\u2019t personally have Spidey Sense. With Miles, I\u2019ve found myself switching suit powers up more depending on the situation.Finding ways to weave all of these new elements into combat is a joy and kept fights from ever feeling stale throughout the nine-hour campaign, or while tackling side challenges like taking down Underground or Roxxon hotspots. And on top of the added skills and adjustments you can make to them when leveling Miles up, Insomniac actually addressed one of my larger gripes with the first game by making the various powers Miles can unlock with his new suits or for his visor more meaningful and interesting. With Peter\u2019s suit skills, I landed on a couple favorites and used them exclusively throughout the adventure. But with Miles, I\u2019ve found myself switching them up more depending on the situation. I loved the combo of enhancing my perfect dodge window with another powerup that lent me additional damage in the seconds after a perfect dodge for battles. But if I went stealthily, I could pick upgrades that let me scan and auto-identify enemies (rather than the standard of needing to highlight each one individually) and even see when other enemies had a particular foe in their line of sight. Not every powerup got the same love in my playthrough, but I kept wanting to test them out and try them in new scenarios to see what benefits they offered. Suit Yourself When it comes to unlockable suits, Miles has a smaller collection than Peter overall, but there\u2019s still a really solid mix of new, original suits and those inspired by his other appearances. I can\u2019t talk about every suit just yet, but some of my favorites are unlocked via side missions and collectibles, and I\u2019ve found myself switching between as many suits as I do powers, and much more often than I did with Peter\u2019s. In particular, Insomniac nailed the Into the Spider-Verse suit. Easily my most anticipated and hoped-for look for Miles, the suit not only gets across the style of the film well in his exaggerated limbs, but its power to transform his animation style into that of the movie made my jaw go slack for a moment. Animating \u201con the twos\u201d so that he appears to skip some frames may be out of sync with the rest of the world, but it is such a cool, well-integrated effect. It\u2019s the suit Miles, and the movie it comes from, deserves. And on the flipside of that, Miles\u2019 foes use a host of new tech to keep your regular brawls more interesting. Yes, the standard Roxxon security force and Underground baddies are fairly simple, at best blocking basic attacks with a crowbar that forces you to dodge under their feet or knock them into the air before beating them down \u2013 but as each respective faction adds a new baddie type to its arsenal, it forces you to fight a bit differently. Underground\u2019s shapeshifting tech means their swords can turn into whips that close the distance to you, while their and Roxxon\u2019s lineups both have big-shield enemies but they each have vastly different attacks. A combination of normal, Venom, and sneak attacks are required to survive through the last third of the story\u2019s fights, and that change in rhythm makes the combat fun to master all the way to the end. A combination of normal, Venom, and sneak attacks are required to survive through the last third of the story.Perhaps most validating are the improvements made to Miles\u2019 side missions and environmental objectives. Much as I loved Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, its reliance on populating neighborhoods with required crime battle quotas and Ubisoft-like radio towers made the hunt to 100% (or for more tokens to acquire upgrades) more of a slog than it needed to be. Its few bright spots, like a photo hunt mission, were what I hoped would be the norm rather than the exception. PS5 Console First Look, Size Comparison 67 Images Thankfully, that is the case with Miles Morales. There are still crimes to stop, but you only really need to beat each type once in the entire city instead of several times per neighborhood, with their optional objectives completed to cross them off your list. The rest of Spider-Man\u2019s neighborly missions are impressively varied \u2013 from helping a window washer restore power to his platform to finding a housecat who ran away. There are a few more once-only missions that feel truer to the spirit of a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man than stopping yet another car chase. Again, because Miles Morales is a smaller package overall, there\u2019s not a ton of these, but I\u2019ll happily take this more selective set of missions that let Spidey have more meaningful interactions with New Yorkers rather than repeating the same task 30 times. I\u2019ll happily take this more selective set of missions that let Spidey have more meaningful interactions with New Yorkers.There\u2019s also a better use of the environment in these missions and collectibles thanks to Miles\u2019 bioelectricity and camouflage. Some missions require you to solve environmental puzzles to get a current flowing between your webs, while you need to go invisible at other times to sneak through a crime scene for clues. And even one of the most plentiful collectibles \u2013 Underground tech caches \u2013 require you to track them down and then occasionally figure out your way past a bit of drywall or construction equipment to get to your prize. All taken together, they allow for a fun cadence to web swinging, fighting, and puzzle solving that, even when I\u2019m hunting down my 20th Underground cache, doesn\u2019t really grow stale. Let It Snow As mentioned, Miles Morales is set in the same Manhattan map as the first game, but this time it\u2019s right around Christmas. New York City in the holidays is something special, with window displays, park decorations, and incredible lights lining the streets. Miles Morales captures that magic in spades, to the point where Insomniac is really just showing off. Beautiful holiday light displays break apart in a cascade of particle effects so gorgeous I forgot to feel bad that I had just demolished some virtual New Yorkers\u2019 hard work. The PS5\u2019s ray tracing truly comes into play when you\u2019re in the heights of the skyline, too, with the grace of Spidey\u2019s movements being reflected on Avengers Tower, the Freedom Tower, and more, all while weather effects from sunshine to snowstorms look beautiful both in the world and brought to life on the reflective windows around you. As one of only a handful of launch PS5 games, the added benefits of native 4K resolution and ray tracing lighting effects provide a stunning take on this already beautiful cityscape. Sunlight cutting through the misty clouds and snow was unexpectedly breathtaking at the height of a swing in the early moments of my first playthrough, and the \u201cWow!\u201d moments only continued from there. Switching over to the 60fps Performance Mode, however, offers beautifully smooth web swinging and combat without missing out on too much of the world. Lighting is a little flatter and less dynamic, but the swap to 60fps is instantly recognizable and worth doing after you\u2019ve toured and absorbed the city at its most beautiful. And as much as I prefer playing in cinematic modes overall, the smoothness 60fps lends to exploration is tough to give up. The smoothness 60fps lends to exploration is tough to give up.There are some beautiful indoor locations as well, often just waiting to be the sites for all-out brawls or stealth sections. From office buildings to theaters and beyond, they really seem more replete with detail this time around. Miles\u2019 story took me somewhere between eight and 10 hours to beat, but I\u2019ve spent at least double that taking in the city\u2019s snowy transformation, pausing mid-mission to admire an interior, or chipping away at the plentiful amount of side content. That impressive level of detail is apparent in the characters as well. The citizens of New York are definitely still less fleshed out than the meticulously modeled main cast (and understandably so), but I did notice a bit more realistic movement and facial animations on them this time around in the side missions. And the work done on the main characters is some of the best real-life approximations I\u2019ve seen from a first-party Sony game outside of The Last of Us Part 2. From the fur on Miles\u2019 jacket hood, to the slight facial changes in a growing smile as he jokes around with Ganke, and more natural body movements in general, the animation really sings both in cutscenes and when swinging, flipping, and zipping across the world. Confirmed PlayStation 5 Games 100 Images Miles Morales on PS5 is as impressive to look at as it is to listen to. While I primarily played using my TV\u2019s soundbar, I did test out Miles Morales\u2019 use of 3D audio while wearing the PS5 3D Pulse headphones, and I found it made things come alive most in the smaller moments. Once I thwipped my way into Central Park and gracefully leaped onto a bridge only to scare away a flock of birds on a frozen pond, and when they shot into the sky and fluttered around me I could hear their irritated caws realistically rising and surrounding me. Car horns and conversations carry as Miles\u2019 position moves and the camera moves around, and you can hear enemy projectiles whiz by in the midst of battle. It\u2019s all fun and engrossing as a good first outing with this fancy new PS5 tech, but not necessarily essential; if you\u2019re playing with TV speakers, a soundbar, or other set-up it\u2019s still great. And even outside of the city's soundscape, the fantastic, driving score and licensed tracks are an energizing delight \u2013 I'd like this soundtrack on vinyl ASAP, please. And it\u2019s all an open-world city with pretty much no load times once you start up Miles Morales. Fast-travel has no time for a funny subway loading animation like Peter\u2019s adventure, and shifts between indoor locations for story missions to cutscenes back to gameplay is nearly instantaneous thanks to the PS5\u2019s SSD."

From the art style to the stamina-based \"climb anything\" mechanic to the gliding, it\u2019s impossible not to be reminded of Link\u2019s open-world adventures in Hyrule while exploring. But this isn't just some copycat, as Genshin Impact's fantastical world, wide array of diverse playable characters, and deep RPG systems are all unique and awesome enough to let it stand on its own two feet \u2013 and every one of the more than 120 hours I've spent in Teyvat has been an absolute blast. Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG where you play a vague and mysterious \u201ctraveler\u201d from another world who arrives in the land of Teyvat before being attacked by a sorceress or God or...something, and your twin is captured. After waking up on a beach at level one and with zero loot, you set off on a quest to find your lost sibling that involves a whole lot of picking fruit, crafting items, and fighting deities, but surprisingly little in the way of actually searching for your twin. Because, just like during Link's rush to save Zelda, completing these quests where you *checks notes* feed ducks is way more important. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Genshin Impact\u2019s story is one of its weaker points, using just about every anime character trope and story cliche in the book. Characters will re-explain the same magical jargon like they\u2019re getting paid by the word, and the story meanders from one amusing misadventure to another with little cohesion. That poor pacing certainly isn\u2019t helped by the XP-gating that happens between each act, where you\u2019ll need to hit an increasingly more difficult to reach Adventurer Rank to advance to the next quest. But since you'll spend most of your time roaming the world and making your own stories as you rank up instead of listening to people explain whatever the heck an Anemoculus is, that messy structure isn't a dealbreaker. And, with a few exceptions, the cast of quirky characters (a whopping 23 of which are playable) are a lot of fun to interact with and play as, even if I occasionally rolled my eyes when they made repeated and very uncalled for horny comments for no reason at all \u2013 yay, anime. Teyvat Traveler The real star here is Teyvat itself, a world that is absolutely bursting at the seams with possibilities. Every nook and cranny is loaded with collectibles to power your characters up with, chests to discover and pull loot from, puzzles to solve, enemies to take down, challenges to complete, dungeons to tackle, relentless bosses to fight, and quests to pursue. It\u2019s actually almost distressing how much there is to do. In any given area in the massive world map, there always seemed to be about five or more things in my immediate field of view to pursue, each with their own challenges and rewards. Sometimes it's difficult just to stay on task and complete major quests simply because there\u2019s such an embarrassment of riches available to you as you explore the world. A locked chest that catches the corner of your eye might lead to an impromptu quest or multi-step puzzle. Following a fluttering blue fairy might lead to a massive combat encounter or even a lengthy boss fight. It\u2019s a disgustingly addictive chain reaction of things to do in the best possible way. Teyvat is a world absolutely bursting at the seams with things to do. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the world of Teyvat is absolutely gorgeous to look at and listen to throughout, with the notable exception of some occasional obligatory over-the-top anime voice acting. Although it borrows more than it invents in terms of presentation, the sights and sounds of this world are still a joy to behold, with breathtaking vistas around every corner and a memorable soundtrack to back them up. On the PS4 and mobile, sometimes you\u2019ll fast travel into an area before it finishes loading and have to wait for the world to catch up with you, but aside from those occasional hiccups, Genshin Impact looks and performs remarkably well. Once you start unlocking new characters, each with their own fighting style, abilities, and elemental affinities, the world takes on different shapes as you gain completely new ways of interacting with it. What was once a lake too vast for you to swim across becomes easily traversable with the help of a cryo-type character like Kaeya that can simply freeze the water. Mountain peaks once too steep to climb become simple to reach once you unlock Venti and his ability to create wind currents wherever he pleases. Just when I thought I understood what my time in Teyvat was going to look like, I unlocked a new character, item, or ability that completely changed the way I played and reinvigorated my excitement for the next dozen hours of obsessive loot chasing. Combat revolves around instantly switching between a party of up to four characters to shoot, hack, and explode through a broad assortment of enemy types. Each character comes equipped with their own elemental type and a few abilities that utilize that element. By switching between characters and using their powers synergistically you can unleash some seriously effective combinations. For example, if you use Xingqui\u2019s water abilities to get the enemy wet, then follow up with Fischl\u2019s electric attack, damage is multiplied and can wipe out a boatload of baddies in one go. Instantly switching characters to synergize powers can enable some serious combos. Filling out your roster of playable characters, weapons, and items, and discovering the ways in which they interact with one another becomes vital to your combat efficiency, especially for certain challenges that require you to finish the encounter before a timer runs out. This becomes particularly important as you approach the current endgame and enemies become more dangerous and gain beefy health bars, especially bosses. Whether you\u2019re fighting a giant wolf who ruins your day with ice attacks that are just plain mean or taking on a flaming plant with some truly disgusting inferno abilities, using every tool at your disposal becomes indispensable. Genshin Impact can also be played co-op after reaching Adventure Rank 16, but at the moment this feature feels pretty tacked on. You can host or join another player to tackle challenges and take down bosses together, but in the vast majority of cases the guest is unable to reap the rewards from any activities you complete. That's too bad, because adventuring with a friend can actually be a lot of fun \u2013 but when one of you is locked out of nearly all loot and progression, merely able to help out in combat, it\u2019s just not rewarding enough to do for more than a short time. \"Work in Progress\" Despite it taking me 120 hours to reach the end of its story quests, Genshin Impact is technically incomplete at the moment, with only two (sizeable) world areas, one complete chapter of its overarching story, and two-thirds of the next one currently accessible. While the prologue is playable in its entirety, the chapter that follows does not have a third act at this time. At the time of this review, developer miHoYo has not provided a roadmap with details as to when we can expect new chapters to be added, though a third region of the map is planned for later this year. That said, there is plenty already here, and the prospect of any coming content updates feel more like MMO expansions than something akin to an early access update. Microtransactions and its \"Gacha\" Model Genshin Impact is entirely free, but the elephant in the room is its \u201cgacha\u201d model \u2013 also known as loot boxes \u2013 that tempts you to spend both in-game currency and real money on randomized characters, loot, consumables, and more. The ecosystem certainly flirts with being pay-to-win (a slightly less meaningful issue in a game with a focus on single-player and no PvP), but manages to strike a decent balance so that those who don't want to spend a dime can still enjoy the whole game for free. While it\u2019s true that all the most powerful characters and weapons can immediately be acquired by investing enough money into loot boxes, they can technically be unlocked by getting lucky with the free currency provided as well \u2013  or if, like me, you manage to play over 120 hours in two weeks without paying anything at all and grind them out through sheer persistence. But more importantly, those powerful weapons and characters are by no means a requirement to advance, and I found myself breezing through most challenges through skill and grinding alone until I finally got lucky with some formidable unlocks that made the going much easier. Have you spent real money in Genshin Impact? Yes, a whole lot Yes, but just a little No, I'm playing for free I haven't played at all Answer See Results The real trouble with the gacha model comes in the later stages of progression, when the grind for account-wide \u201cadventure XP\u201d and upgrade materials becomes an exponentially steeper climb and time-gated activities that reward those things become a massive progression roadblock\u2026 which can be lifted for the right price, of course. This means that those willing to shell out some money are able to advance through the endgame much faster than non-paying players, who will have to play a heck of a lot more to catch up. In fact, just about every item in Genshin Impact can be acquired with enough help from your wallet, and anytime you run up against one of these barriers, you can be sure a pop-up will come to remind you exactly how you can overcome it. Admittedly it took about 40-50 hours of play before that wall really started to loom in front of me, but once it hits progression can slow substantially. The good news is that I still enjoyed almost every part of Genshin Impact\u2019s grind, even after more than 100 hours. The gameplay loop of exploring the world, solving puzzles, beating up baddies, completing quests, and unlocking new characters and equipment to upgrade and experiment with is incredibly addictive. Even in later stages when lucrative quests dry up and you\u2019re left to wander Teyvat solving puzzles and finding hidden chests for slivers of XP and loot, it\u2019s hard to complain when all of that is still a ton of fun. Even if the temptation to pull out your credit card is ever-present and sometimes in your face, the grind (so far) hasn\u2019t been unpleasant enough to make the experience painful for me as a free player.

        "Content": "In the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, a poor soul is doomed to forever push a boulder uphill without rest. Each time he\u2019d push it up, it would roll back down again and he\u2019d have to start anew. But what if that Herculean climb uphill was actually awesome combat against a randomized variety of enemies as you fight your way out of Hell, with a wide range of godly powers that grow and combine in interesting ways as you progress? And what if, instead of going back to zero, you got a little stronger each time with some help from a colorful cast of allies and enemies who remember each of your attempts? That\u2019s Hades\u2019 premise, and the Greek mythology-themed rogue-lite that developer Supergiant has built around it makes going to Hell a joy. The journey of Zagreus, son of Hades, through the labyrinthine Underworld toward the freedom of the mortal realm unfolds from an isometric perspective as you take on hordes of colorfully animated undead that fill the screen with danger in every randomly ordered room you pass through. Fortunately, Zag is a skilled warrior capable of wielding six different weapons, each with four different variants. Each of these Infernal Arms is geared to complement a certain playstyle. Want to get in the thick of it and wreck some demons? Then consider the straightforward Stygian Blade. Prefer to peck at foes from a safe distance? Then channel your inner Artemis and use the bow. Later you\u2019ll unlock a bashing shield, a spear, and more, and each plays significantly differently, creating one of many layers of replayability for Hades. Regardless of your weapon of choice, Zag can use a dash to dart out of trouble or to get into a more advantageous position. And let me tell you -- few things in life are as satisfying as a successful last-second dodge that sets you up for stabbing an enemy in the back for bonus damage. Almost inevitably, the forces of Hades will overwhelm you. \u201c The final mechanic in Zag\u2019s moveset is the cast: a skill-shot based projectile that fires a red jewel into an enemy for a quick burst of damage. The jewel embeds itself into a target, disqualifying you from firing another cast until you kill the enemy and retrieve your ammunition, so shooting it at the biggest, meanest enemy in the room isn\u2019t always the best idea. As with each one of Zag's moves, using it well involves a delicate balance between risk and reward. Almost inevitably, though, the forces of Hades will overwhelm you eventually, and every death sends Zag back home to start over from scratch, save for persistent currencies and progress in relationships with the wonderful cast of characters who inhabit the Underworld, from lord Hades himself all the way down. So you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time getting to know everyone -- and it\u2019s time very well spent. Which Greek God is the G.O.A.T.? Zeus Ares Athena Artemis Poseidon Hermes Answer See Results Zag is a rebellious heartthrob trying to find his place in the world between Hades and Mount Olympus. His sympathetic coming-of-age story brought me in, but I fell in love with his tongue-in-cheek musings on the world around him and snarky back-and-forth with the disembodied voice of the Narrator. Each personality feels like an authentic reinterpretation of a classic Greek myth, and they\u2019re all a joy to behold. \u201c But the heart and soul of Hades, outside of its combat, lies in Zag\u2019s interaction with various deities and mythic figures from Greek myth, like Achilles, Orpheus, and more. It turns out that adding a dash of dating simulator mechanics to a rogue-lite was the secret sauce in making good use of a large cast of interesting characters. Each personality feels like an authentic reinterpretation of a classic Greek myth, and they\u2019re all a joy to behold. For instance, instead of painting Sisyphus as a tragic character, he's an optimist who you encounter on a break while the gods aren\u2019t watching. Even his boulder (affectionately known as Bouldy) sports a carved smile that reacts in silence upon interaction. Investing in Zag\u2019s relationships with each character paves the way for interesting backstory reveals, world-building, new sidequests, or even items to assist on your future escape attempts. Not only are conversations and side stories actively engaging -- attempting to reunite Achilles with his life-long partner, Patroclus, or Orpheus with his long-lost muse Euridice, are genuinely moving and hearken back to the kind of melodrama the ancient Greeks were so good at -- there are also gameplay benefits! Advancing these relationships far enough grants you persistent keepsakes and companions, which are both invaluable tools in aiding Zag's quest to run away from home. Of course, not all keepsakes are as useful as others; given the choice between the Lucky Tooth that grants you an additional chance at life if you\u2019re killed or Olympic keepsakes that increase your chance at better drops, I\u2019m going with a second life every time. Hades Screenshots 31 Images Something that\u2019s truly special and unusual about Hades is that Supergiant Games uses these persistent relationships to travel the difficult path of marrying story to gameplay, and in doing so elevates the simple loop of Zag's escape into something more than the sum of its parts. Within the world of most rogue-lites, a failed run is not typically seen as part of the story (with apologies to Rogue Legacy). But in Hades, a death leads to Zag returning home to mockery (usually from Papa Hades). This transforms something as fundamental as death from a video game-y failure state into in-game world building. Characters remember your triumphs and failures with a staggering amount of incidental dialogue that made me feel like I was constantly chipping away at new content within Zagreus\u2019 story even when I failed. After a while I no longer feared death, I embraced it as an opportunity to learn and revist friends back in the House of Hades to see if they have something new to say. I no longer feared death, I embraced it as an opportunity to learn and revist friends back in the House of Hades. \u201c Losing the fear of death is important, because you\u2019re going to do a lot of dying. I didn\u2019t manage a successful escape until attempt 31 (which I hear is roughly the average...I hope). Fortunately, while things with the citizens of the Underworld might be complicated, Zag\u2019s aunts, uncles, and cousins up on Olympus are eager to assist his rebellion thanks in equal part to genuine familial care and wanting to rub Lord Hades\u2019 nose in it if you eventually succeed. Their aid comes in the form of boons (run-specific tokens from the gods that grant Zag godly power-ups) that modify to Zag\u2019s abilities, making every run feel new and unique. Some are smaller, min-max stat-worthy benefits that often feel like a daily vitamin -- you\u2019re not sure you notice the difference they make as you play, but they stack up over time and make all the behind-the-scenes numbers larger in your favor, so it\u2019s probably a good thing. And of course, during each run you also build your relationships with the Gods of Olympus by offering them tokens of appreciation in the form of nectar and ambrosia that you collect, which also grant you access to their own collection of keepsakes and up the chances of receiving rare, epic, and heroic variants of their boons with progressively better stats. Those familiar with Greek myth are already aware of the fickle nature of the gods.Every now and then, treks through Hades present Zag with a Trial of the Gods, a chamber that allows you to select one of two different deities to commune with. Poseidon may be your bestie early on in your quest, but choose Dionysus over him in a later Trial and he won\u2019t hesitate to make your life a living hell in this particular chamber. Your reward, should you survive, is possessing two different boons at once as opposed to the typical one. Sometimes the gods play nice together. Say, for example, you have the Curse of Agony from Ares, a boon that allows you to inflict doom status (which inflicts an additional burst of damage after a brief period of time) on an enemy with normal attacks. But if, upon clearing another chamber you find Athena\u2019s Divine Dash (which upgrades your dash move to deflect incoming attacks) a rare duo boon will activate, combining the strengths of both into one convenient package. In this case it creates Merciful End, which inflicts any enemy hit with a deflected attack with doom status. These combinations of powers are wonderful surprises. And let me tell you, that rabbit hole runs deep. \u201c And let me tell you, that rabbit hole runs deep. There are a ton of different boons and combinations to earn, and you\u2019ll still be seeing new ones after dozens of runs. Like any good roguelike, Hades forces you to make difficult decisions that either complement your current build or throw caution to the wind and attempt a riskier build that could pay off four chambers down the line...if you survive long enough and luck into the boon you\u2019re hoping for. All of that feeds into Hades\u2019 impressive replayability. Once again, I\u2019m blown away by the staggering amount of content within Hades. While you may face the same bosses over and over again, they too will adapt to your increase in power level. Whether it be in the form of Street Fighter-style assists from siblings, sprouting new heads, or fancy new armor, repeated encounters with bosses felt fresh because of these clever modifications to how they fight. It makes sense within the fiction as well, considering the bosses remember their past failures and successes against you. Each fight is like a rematch between rivals rather than a repeat. Top 25 Nintendo Switch Games 26 Images Like me, after a couple of successful escapes you may find yourself thinking, \u201cHow can I make subsequent attempts harder?\u201d Enter the Pacts of Punishment, a challenge board that allows you to activate a number of modifiers to make Hades even more challenging. Toggling one on adds allows you to earn new rewards, making every playthrough fresh and exciting. You\u2019re constantly given incentive to shake up your playstyle, whether it be through rewarding you with a currency buff for using weapons you don\u2019t normally use, or completing objectives within a scroll known as the \u201cFated List of Minor Prophecies.\u201d (Get it? The optional objectives known as prophecies will eventually come true, it\u2019s just a matter of time.) You're constantly given incentive to shake up your playstyle. \u201c I rolled credits on Hades at approximately 48 hours and I\u2019m still met with new storylines, challenges, and side stories to tackle -- and a peak at the achievement list teases an epilogue I\u2019ve yet to discover how to unlock.   The Music of Hades Supergiant Games is known for its musical craft: Bastion\u2019s somber tones of a world lost, Transistor\u2019s lounge-singer popstar lyrics soaked in sorrow, and Pyre\u2019s epic poem-esque melodies are a constant in my Spotify playlist. It should surprise no one that the music of Hades is unlike any of those, but still of the same caliber as composer Darren Korb\u2019s memorable compositions. Hades is a blend of Rock n\u2019 Lute, a melodic partnership between old and new that always pumps me up for my next journey through the Underworld. A lot of the music is diegetic, meaning it exists within the world of Hades, in that it\u2019s usually sung as a hymn from the legendary musician Orpheus. At the same time, Hades\u2019 score is decidedly understated relative to Supergiant\u2019s previous games, but it all comes together to serve the tone and characters of the underworld. I think the highest compliment I can pay to the Hades soundtrack is that it simply belongs. I didn\u2019t know what Euridice the Muse sounded like, but hearing her sing a lonely tune in an alcove of Asphodel just felt right. "

        "Content": "If playing through The Last of Us Part 2\u2019s bleak world is like taking a cold shower, Spiritfarer's is something closer to sliding into a warm bubble bath. Unexpectedly playing these two games side-by-side this month was a bit jarring, as both tackle the heavy topics of death and those left behind in its wake \u2013 but while the former does so through dark, unrelenting realism, the latter instead offers a colorful, feel-good hug. And though I do love The Last of Us Part 2, Spiritfarer undoubtedly sails alongside it as one of my favorite games of the year.  While genres can be helpful to quickly explain the structure of a game, Spiritfarer has defied all my best attempts to label it. One could say it\u2019s a story-driven base management 2D action-platformer visual novel metroidvania, but I\u2019d rather just say it\u2019s unique . Its closest analogue might be something like Animal Crossing as you sail on, upgrade, and rearrange a boat full of friendly spirits that ask you to complete tasks for them (if, instead of leaving town, your villagers eventually told you they were ready to die and asked you to do it, that is). Regardless of labels, the result is a gorgeously animated adventure that finds plenty of charm and excitement in what could easily be a gloomy subject.  Spiritfarer Gameplay Screenshots  23 Images  You play as Stella (accompanied by her adorable cat Daffodil, who can optionally be controlled by another player in local co-op), who must take over as the new Spiritfarer: a mythological ferrymaster who sails an ocean full of fantastical islands in search of spirits to house and, eventually, bring to their final rest at the Everdoor. That task will take you to beautiful villages full of rice fields, snowy lighthouses, and even bustling spirit cities as you collect resources and upgrade your ship in ways that let you explore more of Spiritfarer\u2019s expansive map. Controlling your boat is as simple as picking a spot on the sea chart, the vast majority of which starts tantalizingly hidden.  Once you\u2019ve set a destination, your ship will automatically chug along to it, leaving you with plenty of time to kill and a boatload of tasks to do. Spirits could ask you to build them a house, collect certain items, or visit specific islands, but you get to decide which of their quest lines to prioritize. You could spend your travel time fishing off the aft and then experimenting with your catches in the kitchen to discover recipes, chatting with your spirit friends to learn more about them, building structures to make new resources available (like an orchard to grow fruit trees), and plenty more. Spiritfarer\u2019s day-night cycle always made it feel like I had more to do than time to do it all in, but there was little penalty to going slow beyond missing my self-imposed deadlines. As a result, it\u2019s a fun challenge to juggle and weave these jobs together efficiently, but never one that felt punishing.  It\u2019s a fun challenge to juggle jobs efficiently, but never one that feels punishing. \u201c  There are also buildable crafting stations that turn raw materials like wood and ore found on islands into usable items through simple but cute button-timing minigames \u2013 like a loom that lets you turn different fibres into thread, and then thread into fabric. The progression of finding one type of material to make a thing needed for an upgrade that lets you find the next tier of material is a bog-standard affair, but I did appreciate how little \u201cgrinding\u201d Spiritfarer asked of me. As long as I was exploring (which I wanted to do anyway) I could generally find what I needed swiftly enough.  In fact, all throughout Spiritfarer, I found myself having to unlearn habits games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have drilled into me. There\u2019s an impulse toward maximum efficiency \u2013 having every station working on a thing at all times; processing all your raw materials as soon as you get them; always making sure you\u2019ve got seeds in your garden and a literal bun in the oven. And while you can play that way, Spiritfarer doesn\u2019t actually demand a fast pace, and doing so turns mundane tasks like melting ore to ingots and watering plants repetitive fast. Eventually, I realized that I could just plant stuff when I needed a certain veggie or make ingots when they were asked for, which turned those tasks back into amusing asides instead of constant chores.  Phantom Pains  The spirits you pick up along the way are all unique characters, each with their own story to uncover, house to build, and even favorite foods to learn \u2013 and while they may start out looking like the generic spirits you see on islands, bringing them onto the ship reveals their true form as some sort of anthropomorphic animal. Whether it\u2019s the lovably obnoxious frog man Atul or the enchantingly posh deer Gwen, they\u2019re all endearing additions to your rapidly growing mobile village.   Each one of them represents a mini story of their own as well, both in unraveling their actual life before death and the literal quest line you\u2019ll follow to make their stay comfortable. Even if some characters are less lovable than others (I\u2019m looking at you, Giovanni), they\u2019re all wonderfully written. Keeping spirits happy through good food and good hugs (the hug animations for each one are just the greatest thing) will also let them pitch in on your journey, sometimes collecting resources or growing plants. Without spoiling them, one of my favorite guests even just gives you cute drawings they made.  But the biggest thing a new spirit will bring is a request for a home of their own. Fulfilling that order asks you to not only find the resources needed to build their abode, but also to find enough space to fit it alongside all the other structures in a complex game of afterlife Tetris. Crucially, few buildings are a simple box shape, usually having odd parts that jut out and slanted roofs that ultimately force your deck into a jumble of ladders and platforms no matter how many space upgrades you buy to make it bigger. It undoubtedly makes it harder to navigate (an issue Spiritfarer has generally, as it\u2019s also annoyingly difficult to do certain simple things like correctly interact with a spirit when they are standing in front of a door), but I loved that this encouraged a wild, patchwork look instead of a boring stack of apartments.  Few buildings are simple boxes, stopping your boat from being a boring stack of apartments. \u201c  The layout of your ship isn\u2019t just for aesthetics, either. Each new passenger also unlocks a corresponding resource-gathering minigame. For example, Gwen\u2019s has you sail into a cloud of spectral jellyfish to catch them as they float by, while Atul turns thunderstorms into an opportunity to literally bottle lightning. There\u2019s no real combat in Spiritfarer, but these exciting encounters fill a similar role and transform the roofs and ledges of your floating town into a platforming jungle gym. Suddenly, layout is incredibly important if you want to efficiently collect jellies, offering real challenge to this otherwise peaceful experience \u2013 and while I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, the combination of sight and sound in a later one of these genuinely made for one of the most magical experiences I\u2019ve had in any game recently.  Styx and Stones  Platforming prowess comes in handy off the boat too, as islands are dotted with hidden chests full of special items, like rare seeds, recipes, or just tons of money. There\u2019s rarely anything too difficult here, but it\u2019s still fun to explore forests and mines alike in search of secrets, all the while talking to the frequently hilarious spirits who live there full-time (some of whom have amusing, if simple, sidequests for you too, like going to other islands to sell rap albums). And while ship upgrades like an ice-breaking hull open up new parts of the sea to explore, unlockable platforming abilities like a double jump or glide will let you access previously unreachable areas on land, giving you a reason to revisit old locations in what is a surprising but not unwelcome metroidvania twist.   The backtracking can get a little tiresome at times, especially as more and more of the map opens up to you, but the way Spiritfarer chains along tasks is impressive. It took me more than two dozen hours to complete, and I always felt like I had a clear goal I was working toward during that time despite rarely having an explicit \u201cmain\u201d objective to lead me. New spirits will come and go from your ship, offering new resources which then unlock new areas that unlock new spirits that unlock new abilities and so on and so forth. This formula does become predictable toward the end, but the characters and locations you see are still so wonderful and diverse that I could have gladly kept going if there were additional spirits to recruit.  But as they come, so do they also go. That\u2019s the cruelest trick Spiritfarer plays: it has you feed and hug and fall in love with these cute, quirky characters, having them help out around the boat and building them lovely custom homes\u2026 and then they have to leave. That part of the job is explicitly explained to you at the start, but the first time I had a spirit ask to go to the Everdoor and leave this world I found myself genuinely in denial. I selfishly delayed it as long as I could, and when I ultimately gave in, taking them there was a shockingly affecting act.  Spiritfarer displays a masterful use of color alongside one of my favorite soundtracks in years. \u201c  Spiritfarer has a lot to say about both life and death, and the way it says it is largely well done. Not all the characters are as impactful as others, but the ones I did connect with really did make me sad to say goodbye. But while it\u2019s undoubtedly somber, Spiritfarer is never a downer. It\u2019s an unrelentingly feel-good game, staying positive (much like the warm hugs Stella so often gives) right to the very end, even when it\u2019s tackling some very heavy stuff.  Part of the reason for that is in its art and music, which are just phenomenal. The way Spiritfarer uses color (especially as the time of day shifts) is spectacular, and all its animations \u2013 from unique hugs to your kitty cat playing with a ball of light \u2013 are impressive as hell. Its music is also some of my favorite in any game from recent memory, up there with the likes of Ori in its orchestral beauty. Even though there were always tasks to complete, I\u2019d frequently find myself just standing at the bow of my boat with the UI turned off, watching the sunset and enjoying the moment as I sailed to a new island."

Not because I felt like I missed anything the first time around \u2013 I was as fastidious as developer Capcom encouraged me to be \u2013 but because my journey through Raccoon City was so consistently packed with tense monster moments and breakneck-paced fun, and it was so challenging throughout its six-odd hours, that I wanted to jump in and do it all over again with sharper skills and knowledge. My undying enthusiasm for it speaks volumes of the polish seen in this remake, and the finesse with which it manages to tread the tightrope between a confident modern horror and a tonal callback to the original Resident Evil trilogy.  Note: This review exclusively covers the single-player campaign of Resident Evil 3. See our Resident Evil: Resistance review for the multiplayer side of the package. Resident Evil 3 takes place nearly concurrently with the events of the equally accomplished Resident Evil 2, and follows different characters. The endearingly practical Jill Valentine \u2013 last seen in the original Resident Evil and its Director\u2019s Cut \u2013 is called upon by a roguish Umbrella Corp mercenary by the name of Carlos Oliviera to help save the remaining inhabitants of a demolished Raccoon City from the carnage spawned by the T-Virus outbreak. Of course, nothing goes to plan, and Jill finds herself in a wonderfully labyrinthine, zombie-studded playground where she \u2013 and your nerves \u2013 must also contend with the threat of an invulnerable monster called Nemesis. Every IGN Resident Evil Game Review Ever 60 Images It\u2019s a very classic Resident Evil set up, but then, this is a remake of a classic, goofily fun Resident Evil story -- the original 1999 game. The major story events from the original Resident Evil 3 are all there, albeit rearranged, and the cheesiness the early trilogy is known for is delivered in a charmingly self-knowing way. \u201cHow is it no one in the hospital ever noticed all this?\u201d Jill wonders aloud after discovering a massive underground base that isn\u2019t particularly well hidden. Resident Evil 3 is also, fortunately, very efficient in its storytelling; the villain is perfectly villainous, the heroes are all selfless and charming, and cutscenes are lean yet efficiently deliver big dramatic moments. It carries the gameplay swiftly along, in other words, and never gets bogged down in unnecessary exposition. Capcom has done an incredible job in the small details here. \u201c The chaotic, ruined Raccoon City goes a long way toward bringing Resident Evil\u2019s story and the broader universe to life. Once again working within the RE Engine that powered both last year\u2019s Resident Evil 2 and 2017\u2019s Resident Evil 7, Capcom has done an incredible job in the small details here; from the in-universe advertising (\u201cNo Spares in This Game!\u201d reads the tagline for a movie called \u201cSudden Death Bowling\u201d) to the detritus left by citizens who had to escape in a hurry, to Resident Evil 2-related Easter eggs (\u201cNow here\u2019s a weird f****ing door!\u201d Carlos says upon encountering the Spade Door, which is so significant in Resident Evil 2\u2019s police station) and genuinely compelling in-game notes and journals that give background context to some poor guy\u2019s tragic death and/or reveal a code to open a safe. These are spaces that feel realistically inhabited and then abandoned, full of the sort of detail that had me poring every inch of a room after I\u2019d killed everything in it. The Best Resident Evil Bosses 11 Images This detail and polish extend to Resident Evil 3\u2019s broader environments, which are stunning. Smashed cars are piled up outside of flickering neon signs, fires lick their way across kitschy storefronts, and broad industrial spaces are eerily empty. Although you can\u2019t interact much with the world unless you are specifically instructed to (this is still a Resident Evil game and is thus inhospitably rigid with its options for touching things) the atmosphere around you is always pulling out all the stops to make you feel vulnerable and small. Not to lean too much into cliches, but I literally jumped at my own in-game shadow more than once. At the very least, every room has useful items or a secret. \u201c Like its predecessor, and indeed, every decent Resident Evil game before it, every part of Resident Evil 3\u2019s world feels deliberately put together. No enemy is thrown in for the sake of it, no room is there \u2018just because\u2019; at the very least, every room has useful items or a secret. Areas house problems to solve or clues that lead you to other areas and then back again; a fire obstructs one route, for example, and must be extinguished with the help of a part hidden in a nearby building \u2013 a building which also houses a weapon that can't be accessed without the use of a tool that's located past the area obstructed by fire. Who Is The Best Resident Evil Protagonist? Chris Redfield Jill Valentine Leon Kennedy Claire Redfield Jake Muller Ada Wong Ethan Winters Answer See Results These tasks might sound video-gamey (and they are), but solving them is never a chore thanks to elegant, interlocking level design that makes backtracking easy. When I say \u201ceasy,\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201csafe,\u201d though, because that corpse on the floor in that building you were in 30 minutes ago, for example, may not be a corpse any longer. Thankfully, the Resident Evil 2 Remake map screen returns, dutifully logging exactly where you saw that locked safe and highlighting if you\u2019ve missed any items after exploring a room. As long as you\u2019re careful you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being punished. \u201c Item micromanagement is where Resident Evil 3 leans hardest into its old-school survival horror lineage. Like the original (and in RE2), items are your lifeline and inventory is limited, and running back and forth between storage chests to make sure nothing is wasted and certain items are combined in smart ways is a must if you want to survive for long. I rarely ran out of bullets and health \u2013 at least during my first run on Standard mode \u2013 but this was due to diligent scavenging rather than items being plentiful. As long as you\u2019re careful in Resident Evil 3, you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being punished, and that\u2019s the mark of any good classic survival horror game. A sense of dread as you navigate Resident Evil 3\u2019s puzzle box of a world is not unfounded, as you can be easily caught unawares by a number of deadly nasties. There\u2019s plenty of variety in enemy design here to keep things fresh, such as the spider-like Drain Deimos who will poison Jill with parasites (the cure is to eat a green herb and then throw up), Pale Heads (first seen in the Resident Evil 2 DLC) who can only be downed by a very accurate blow to the head with your most extreme weaponry, and more things trying to eat your brains beyond your garden variety zombie. Even the latter can prove deadly, especially because they feel faster and more erratic in their movements than their predecessors in Resident Evil 2 and can show up in big enough numbers to really overwhelm you. There\u2019s plenty of variety in enemies to keep things fresh. \u201c Fortunately, Jill is a lot nimbler on her feet than Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield, which gives Resident Evil 3 a more frantic, action-oriented feel than its predecessor (though it\u2019s not all-out-action like Resident Evil 5 or 6, don\u2019t worry). Jill has a quick step move that allows her to sidestep an incoming attack, and when timed just right it earns you a slight slow-motion effect to help you escape. It\u2019s a move I used regularly and compulsively, and it proved as important to the minute-to-minute combat as Jill\u2019s handgun. Some of its best moments involved me getting a jump scare from an unexpected zombie and dodging out of its way via pure muscle memory before lining up a headshot with my shotgun. Of course, Jill isn\u2019t limited to a single gun; she gradually unlocks the classic Resident Evil arsenal (handgun, shotgun, grenade launcher, etc.), and each weapon feels satisfyingly weighty to shoot. More importantly, I used every gun right up until the end, thanks to upgrades to basic weapons that extend their shelf-life significantly. My original shotgun, for example, was upgraded with a Shell Holder, Tactical Stock, and a Semi-Auto Barrel, which made it far more efficient against Resi 3\u2019s tougher enemies in the latter part of the campaign. I faced one of RE3\u2019s most delightfully difficult challenges as Carlos. \u201c To shake up the pace, Resident Evil 3 intermittently switches you to Carlos\u2019 perspective; our merc is a little less scrappy and nimble and a little more action-forward than Jill, equipped with a powerful assault rifle that can clear a room from the get-go, at the cost of precious ammunition. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easier \u2013 I faced one of Resident Evil 3\u2019s most delightfully difficult challenges as Carlos, which involved plowing down wave after wave after wave of enemies in a very confined space. It was, not to put too fine a point on it, a blast. But this is primarily Jill\u2019s show, and she needs everything at her disposal. Resident Evil 3\u2019s central antagonist, Nemesis, is powerful and fast, moving like a giant, horribly disfigured cat stalking and pouncing on its prey across a series of exhilarating boss fights. These battles see you face off against him in sprawling arenas; it\u2019s just you and your arsenal against whatever horrific form he\u2019s evolved into. Executing a perfect dodge as he leaps at you from afar is a wonderful feeling, as is blowing him off the side of a building with a mine grenade. Nemesis is powerful and fast, moving like a giant, horribly disfigured cat. \u201c It\u2019s a shame, then, that he doesn\u2019t show up more often. Mr. X in Resident Evil 2 is so frightening because his presence felt unexpected, which led to a feeling that you were never safe even if you were in areas you thought you could be. Nemesis apes this pattern in Resident Evil 3\u2019s first couple of hours \u2013 there\u2019s a brilliantly climactic showdown with him that involves you desperately trying to escape through a vent as he pursues you \u2013 but he soon gets relegated to big, pre-programmed boss fights. Once that happens, that sense of the looming pursuer operating under his own AI is lost. Who Would Win in a Fight? Mr. X Nemesis Answer See Results There is no New Game Plus after Resident Evil 3\u2019s campaign, but completing in-game challenges \u2013 such as collecting all bobbleheads, knocking X number of hats off a zombie, X number of kills with a certain weapon, etc \u2013 unlock a shop where you can cash in your points on useful items to be used in a second or third playthrough. These items, such as coins that make your attacks more powerful or weapons with infinite ammo, made my next playthrough on Resident Evil 3\u2019s hard mode a lot more...manageable."

        "Content": "I knew Doom Eternal had proven its point when I started taking down Marauders without breaking a sweat, really. These terrifying, devil-horned axe-wielders had been life-threatening challenges when they were first introduced midway through the game, but a while later I delighted in turning the tables on them thanks to some powerful and hard-earned upgrades. Doom Eternal not only retains the wild, high-speed, to-the-brink-of-death-and-back-again ebb and flow of combat that its 2016 predecessor excelled at, it tweaks the formula to introduce more strategy, replayability, and ultimately, satisfaction to this 15+ hour first-person shooter campaign.  You need to start to read the defense like a quarterback at the line of scrimmage. \u201c Some great games are clever exercises in thoughtful design while others are dumb fun, but Doom Eternal is the best of both. Yes, blasting and ripping demons literally in half with your bare hands is a gleefully, gloriously stupid power fantasy, and Doom Eternal teaches you how to do it better, faster, and in multiple ways as you go. It makes you a smart Slayer. Before long, you\u2019ll be thrown into the meat grinder with dozens of Hell\u2019s denizens at once, including resurrected Doom 2 favorites not seen in the 2016 reboot. Old folks like me remember the Pain Elemental, a semi-dangerous, Lost Soul-spewing cousin of the Cacodemon, and the demon-buffing, pyromaniacal Archvile, which, as in 1994, is one of the biggest threats you have to beat down. Scenes teeming with enemies that would make most other first-person shooters buckle under the pressure, either framerate-wise or gameplay-wise or both, are commonplace in Doom Eternal, and it takes them in stride. In fact, Eternal looks and runs gorgeously on my mid-range PC (i5 @ 3.5Ghz with 16GB of RAM and an RTX 2060), with monsters and environments alike looking much more detailed than they did in 2016. And when you\u2019ve got all those monsters gunning for you, Doom Eternal does something unexpected: it starts to get intellectual in the midst of its carnage. To be effective, you need to start to read the defense like a quarterback at the line of scrimmage, and timing is everything. On a basic level it\u2019s the same game plan as Doom 2016, in that you can largely ignore the pissant zombies, soldiers, and imps at the start of a big fight \u2013 you might need to use them to farm for resources later. But in Eternal, many heavy-hitting demons like the Mancubus or Cacodemons have weak points you can exploit. For instance, aim for the former\u2019s rocket-launching arms to disable its guns, then lob a sticky grenade from your shotgun\u2019s secondary fire into the open mouth of the latter and he\u2019ll instantly be vulnerable to a close-up glory kill (and there are dozens of new finishing animations this time around). This opens up a new level of finesse that rewards precision in the heat of battle rather than spraying everything with as much death as possible. Doom Eternal (January 2019 Screenshots) 13 Images Also, Doom Eternal heard you like upgrades, so it\u2019s upgraded its upgrades so you can upgrade while you\u2019re upgrading. As before, weapon upgrades unlock alternate-fire modes and eventually mastery skills; collectible Runes grant up to three passive, hot-swappable bonuses like a speed boost after a glory kill; Sentinel Crystals give new abilities and up your max health, ammo, or armor; Praetor Suit tokens let you choose from over a dozen skills to augment, from grenade improvements to more detailed maps for unlocking secrets. Meanwhile, any foe can be torched with the new Flame Belch suit accessory, causing them to perspire armor shards to help get you ready for the next fight \u2013 or save your bacon in the current one. Using it at the right moment is key to pulling off some great victories. What is your favorite Doom game of all time (so far)? Doom (1993) Doom 2 Doom 64 Doom 3 Doom (2016) Answer See Results Need ammo? If you can\u2019t find enough around the battlefield, Eternal doesn\u2019t just use the chainsaw as a kill-(almost)-anything, get-out-of-jail-free card \u2013 the ultimate melee weapon is once again an ammo generator that can put you back in the game after you\u2019ve run dry and would otherwise be all but helpless as well. So, you can spend your fuel tank cutting down three imps and get fully restocked by a colorful ammunition shower \u2013 unless, of course, you choose to empty it in one fell swoop on that one last big guy making your life hell, instantly ending the threat in one glorious cleave. Collectively, these tweaks and additions are a refinement of the fantastic system that the previous Doom struck gold with, but they go a long way toward making the combat feel deeper and more multiple-choice.  White-Knuckle Sandwich Battles, then, become an elaborate, highly kinetic dance \u2013 and you\u2019re Shakira at the Super Bowl. You\u2019ll need every weapon in your arsenal at multiple points throughout the entire campaign, and that includes every double-dash move, every double jump, every monkey bar to swing from \u2013 a new feature that highlights Eternal\u2019s focus on free-play level design. These are as much jungle gyms as they are battlegrounds thanks to the turbo-mobility that they give you; you can kill time soaring around, away from even the nimblest of monsters, if you need a moment to regroup and strategize. No two Slayers will slay the same exact way. \u201c The best new weapon, again echoing 1994\u2019s Doom 2, is the Super Shotgun: a double-barrelled duck gun with a meathook attachment that, in a fittingly Doom-y twist, brings you to the target for an in-your-face blast rather than the other way around. That allows for maximum damage from the short-range sawed-off\u2019s twin-shell blasts and also gives you even greater mobility. In all, there are enough new options that it seems like no two Slayers will slay the same exact way, and that makes for welcome watercooler talk with friends as well as genuine replayability. Speaking of secrets, in traditional Doom fashion, Eternal is packed with them. Some tease you in plain sight and challenge you to reach them, while others are tucked cleverly out of the way. Most require your best double-jumping, air-dashing platforming skills in order to reach their location \u2013 first-person platforming is emphasized much more in this sequel, mostly to good effect. Rewards range from upgrade points to collectible Funko Pop-like toys of each monster, and the search for them becomes something of a reward in and of itself because of how much fun it is to solve each secret\u2019s little puzzle \u2013 not to mention how they serve as a refreshing cool-down period after you finish off another big combat bowl.  Killin\u2019 and Chillin\u2019 Unfortunately most of the plot is buried in menu-based text logs. \u201c Between missions you\u2019ll return to the Fortress of Doom \u2013 the Slayer\u2019s Earth-orbiting headquarters/mancave (which, hilariously, has an actual mancave in it that you shouldn\u2019t skip). The Fortress is far too big and empty for what it actually offers, which isn\u2019t much, but it does let you sample classic id Software soundtracks from the past 25 years \u2013 and I recommend that you do! And yes, like its predecessor, there is an unexpected amount of actually respectable plot underneath all of the neck-snapping, eyeball-popping madness. Doom Eternal\u2019s story is surprisingly fleshed out, though unfortunately you have to read most of it in menu-based text logs instead of the dramatic, scenery-chewing performance it deserves. I was happy to follow along at first, but by the latter third of my quest to save Earth and all of mankind I\u2019d grown weary of reading log after log and just thirsted for more action. I hope a likely threequel either does a better job of integrating the story into the gameplay, or at least goes the audio log route like so many other games so I can keep playing while I listen to the backstory of the \u201cMaykrs\u201d and the Sentinels.   What I Thought of Doom (2016) Though I didn\u2019t review the Doom (2016), I absolutely loved it \u2013 in my book it\u2019s easily a high 8 or a low 9 (back when we had the 100-point review scale). Multiplayer was very vanilla, sure \u2013 my biggest beef with it was that I thought the TTK was way too high \u2013 but it was a sideshow to the main event: The campaign was a revelation for someone (me) whose all-time favorite game is the original Doom. The 2016 reboot managed to reinvent and reinvigorate Doom for the modern era while still respecting the original and maintaining its soul.  A 15-hour single-player game is nothing to sneeze at, but the rest of Eternal offers a lot . In addition to the meaty campaign, Slayer Gates and secret timed encounters hidden in each level serve up one-off rounds of extra challenge (and extra reward), while the Master Levels let you run the campaign again with a much tougher menagerie of monsters waiting for you at every turn. There\u2019s also the 2v1 demons-vs.-Slayer Battlemode multiplayer, which is, on paper, a uniquely Doom take on competitive multiplayer; we\u2019ll review that separately when servers go live on launch day. 10 Best id Software Weapons 10 Images To me, Doom Eternal\u2019s brilliance can be summed up in the road to its first big boss fight, about a third of the way through the Hell-on-Earth quest. It deliberately builds this battle up, taunting you along the way with glimpses of the enemy before it\u2019s brought to life and unleashed upon you. And then when it finally is, and the difficult battle is won, you go through a portal and the gods that are set against you announce, \u201cWe\u2019re not through with you yet!\u201d and then you\u2019re immediately launched into an even tougher battle. No respite, no health pickups, no ammo restock \u2013 you\u2019re just right back into the fire. And when I persevered, I felt incredible. I\u2019m talking actual, real-life-fist-pumping incredible; I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve audibly celebrated more while playing a single-player video game \u2013 and returning composer Mick Gordon\u2019s new (and once again fantastic) heavy metal soundtrack certainly deserves some credit for that."

        "Content": "There are so many different types of Animal Crossing players, and yet Animal Crossing: New Horizons manages to improve upon the virtual lives of each player type that I can think of. For The Collector, there's a near-bottomless bounty of bugs, fish, and furniture to gather; for The Designer, there are new tools and few limits to what you can craft and customize. But it\u2019s the The Artists, The Decorators, and The Dreamers who should be most excited: There's an entire island to jazz up, expanding the customizable area far beyond the walls of your house, which is all that previous Animal Crossing games allowed them to tinker with. Throw a swimming pool on the beach; add a giant kaiju statue to your garden; even literally move mountains. You can customize so much in New Horizons that it has me just as excited to see what people create as recent, lauded craft-'em-ups like Super Mario Maker 2 or Dreams.  Slow(er) Start In order to deliver a blank slate for you to customize the crap out of, Nintendo made some questionable calls that lead to a very slow start to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yes, Animal Crossing always starts out slow. But New Horizons is even slower: At the outset, two brave villagers and a very industrious raccoon family are the island's only residents. Cut off from any mainland, it's just you, trees, water, rocks, and slow accumulation of buildings and animal villagers over the course of several (real time) days. It's a different vibe than moving to a new town already full of bustling shops and animals going about their lives, and while building a town from scratch offers a lot of customization, it takes too long to get to the good stuff. And by \u201cgood stuff\u201d I mean the basics: The museum, shopping, and even access to parts of the island which require tools like the pole and ladder to reach , all days away from when you first load up New Horizons on your Switch. Every IGN Animal Crossing Game Review 10 Images Like past games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons uses your Nintendo system\u2019s real clock, which means many game goals are locked behind a \"sleep wall.\" Like the paywall found in some mobile games, which requires you to pay real money for resources to progress, in New Horizons you have to wait until the next actual day to see the bridge you built, or the store you upgraded, or the animal you invited to town come to fruition. There's just not enough to do for these first few days while the sleepy island is waking up. You can't scale cliffs or cross rivers until you satisfy requirements that span several real time days. To make it worse, resources deplete and reset daily, so outside of fishing and bug hunting you can't even effectively farm for bells while you wait. Unless, of course, you cheat it by changing that system clock. See below for my thoughts on that...   Should You Time Travel in New Horizons? In Hawaii there's something called \"island time,\" which is sold to tourists as a relaxed way of living that they are encouraged to adapt to by not caring if people are late. (In practice, it means you're going to be stuck in traffic a lot.) If you can adapt to island time in New Horizons, go for it! I, however, was too excited to wait to unlock tools, shops, and all the other goodies (that you get faster in previous games). So I broke my usual rule and time traveled using this trick :   Complete your daily goals and talk to Tom Nook.  Save your game.  Enter the Switch System Settings menu and scroll down to System.  Choose Date and Time and turn Synchronize via Internet to OFF.  Click on Date and Time and set your clock to the following day.  Select Animal Crossing: New Horizons from the menu screen and hit X to close it.  Restart the game and you should be playing on your new day.  It's important to note that New Horizons has built-in penalties for abusing time travel, so Nintendo recognizes time travel is part of Animal Crossing, but lightly discourages it -- so you can treat it like cheat codes for money in The Sims 4, or quicksaving every three seconds in Fallout 4. In the 3DS\u2019 Animal Crossing: New Leaf, I staunchly refused to change the clock and spent the full actual year collecting all the bugs, fish, and seasonal treats available. So resorting to this was a tough decision for me, but one that I'd grudgingly recommend for the first 15 or so in-game days. After that, most of your island layout tools are unlocked and you should be good to go, and the temptation to jump through time should wane.   Custom Fit One way or another, eventually you will have access to the tools to make your island whatever you want it to be, and that's where Animal Crossing: New Horizons really breaks from its predecessors -- and where it shines. The customizable island is a huge advancement. I love the terraforming tools above all else : you can form hills, cliffs, land bridges, waterfalls, lakes, miniature islands, and rivers with ease. You can flatten your entire island and raise a pyramid of waterfalls decorated in skulls, if you want that Bond villain vibe. You can also build bridges and ramps to make your island's far reaches easily accessible, and move any buildings you'd like, at any time. 109 Images Finally, you can place the things you craft and buy anywhere outdoors as well, which represents another huge leap forward in fun customization. You can make a cool beach hangout, or a zen temple on a cliffside, just by dropping things on the ground. The total freedom to create a custom island has me more excited than anything else in New Horizons, and I eagerly await fan community tributes to Zelda, Mario, and other pop culture recreations, along with original designs. I lost myself in island decoration (partially because the act of decorating your island, in turn, unlocks more tools) and began to neglect expanding and decorating my home. But the new home decorator is better than ever as well, with a brilliant new tool to easily place everything without having to handle it, a 360-degree view, and tons of cool, interactive things you can add to your house. Projectors and lamps that you can turn on, turntables and boomboxes to play music that you collect, and even animated wallpaper. The well of things to buy, find, and now, craft, is seemingly bottomless -- and may continue to expand, depending on what Nintendo's unannounced update plans turn out to be.  The Loop A few days in I fell into a nostalgic pattern: The loop. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, my loop is a literal, counter-clockwise run around the island. I spot daily fossil digs, talk to animals, cast a line out to any suspicious fish shadows, hit the shops, talk to villagers, and joyfully juggle the tasks that inevitably pile up. These are chores, and in the field of making chores seem fun, Tom Sawyer has somehow found his match in Tom Nook. In making chores fun, Tom Sawyer has met his match in Tom Nook. \u201c Nook Miles \u2013 which serve as both achievements and a currency \u2013 are an additional system added to New Horizons that became part of my daily routine. These are awarded for, among other things, hitting randomized daily achievements which range from hard (catching a specific type of fish three times) to dull (watering flowers). Miles can be exchanged for inventory upgrades (video gaming's greatest upgrade!), rare island decor, major landscaping tools, or tickets to the \"nearby islands\" (which I\u2019ll discuss below). The miles are, like many other systems, another grind, but checking them did scratch the daily check-in itch I play Animal Crossing for. So yes, I'll water the darn flowers.  Craft-'Em-Up Crafting offers a major change to furniture, clothing, and tool acquisition in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Although you\u2019re now allowed to customize many basic designs, it has a very grindy downside: Because every game has to be Minecraft now, the root of crafting in New Horizons is hitting trees and rocks to see what falls out. This is a slow process, made slower by your tools that you've recently crafted breaking down and thus perpetuating the crafting cycle. It's more busywork than fun, and there are no shortcuts: You whack a stone four times and then you pick up each rock. One. At. A. Time. And while you can fortify your tools to be more durable, I've crafted 15 or so fortified fishing rods at this point, each after the last broke at a really inopportune time. (Pro tip: You can carry your crafting bench with you at all times to make a spare tool in a pinch. No need to leave it at home.) Rather than deal with the crafting hassle, I preferred plopping down bells for weird, Nintendo-designed furniture sets and even weirder clothes in pre-made forms from shops.  What's The Story? Animal Crossing fans probably didn't expect to be reading about a plot in this review, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons not only has one, but it\u2019s appropriately cute and I loved it. Previous games in the series have you moving to a new town and paying off your bills -- that's about it. But in New Horizons, there's an additional motivation to customize your island, recruit new animal residents, and work towards a better \"island eval\" rating; a five-star system that takes outdoor furniture, bridges, ramps, residents, flowers, and much more into account. The details of this motivation constitute a big spoiler, which I'll of course spare you.   How Long Does It Take to \u201cBeat\u201d Animal Crossing: New Horizons? I know what you are going to comment: \u201cAnimal Crossing games don't have endings.\u201d But this one does! In short, I spent about 30 hours \u2013 32 in-game days \u2013 meeting Tom Nook's demands to complete the story and see the credits roll. But beyond that, there are hundreds of hours of things I'm already planning to do with my island, with my friends, and (hopefully) with the free event update DLC planned for later this year.   Critter Country Eventually, your town will be bustling with animal residents -- up to 10 can move in to housing plots you can freely place and move. And the variety of animals available is stunning ! Check out all the ones we know about in the slideshow below to see what I mean. Animal Crossing Amiibo Cards (Series 1-4) 400 Images Each animal has a personality type, and their interactions are always cute: They argue with each other, assemble to sing or do yoga, and sometimes give you minigame challenges (like a funny card guessing game) or random gifts. A cool feature of New Horizons is the ability to recruit new animals via a trip to a nearby randomly-generated island , or from the campground site which occasionally spawns a random animal in town . Even cooler is the ability to force a camper to join your campsite with an amiibo card . If you can track down your favorite animal amiibo cards, you can fill your town with only the A-listers.   My Favorite Villagers    Lucky - A mummy -- or an unlucky, bandaged dog? Well, his name is Ramses in France (a reference to an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh), and he has glowing eyes. Mummy confirmed.  Octavian - A very cranky octopus. You can fish for assorted molluscs in this game and give him one, so that's messed up.  Coco - A... gyroid rabbit? She's made of wood and likes donuts.   Your Favorite Villagers  But who are the fan-favorite animal villagers? Well, we built a fun Animal Crossing Villager Face-Off tool you gotta check out : Each vote will be used to determine a ranked, crowdsourced list of the best Animal Crossing villagers .   Collectathon There are endless lists of things to hunt, buy, horde, and display in New Horizons. Let's start with my favorite: Bugs and fish are back in abundance with a list of 80 each to collect, some unique to various seasons to keep you hunting all year. There are a lot of overlapping creatures from previous games, but it's still fun to find them all and sell the rest for Bells. Even more rewarding is the museum, with gorgeously rendered exhibits that come to life: Schools of fish in custom tanks, swarms of bugs breaking out of their displays, interactive exhibits and adorable photo ops. Even the less-animated fossil wing is greatly improved, with realistic fossil displays and a bizarre evolution room, demonstrating the connections between present-day villagers and ancient beasts. After 32 days of in-game play, and a brief visit to an island in another hemisphere, I had 60 of New Horizons' fish, and 40 bugs, so I still have a ways to go. Check out Animal Crossing: New Horizons complete fish list along with prices here . And there's a big list of bugs in our guide , too. What fruit do you hope to start with? Apple \ud83c\udf4f Peach \ud83c\udf51 Orange \ud83c\udf4a Cherry \ud83c\udf52 Persimmon \ud83c\udf45 Pear \ud83c\udf50 Answer See Results You can take a day trip to a randomly generated \"nearby\" island, which might have different fruit to nab, but \"nearby\" means the islands you visit are in the same season, so you won't be finding rare winter fish while its summer on your island. This is disappointing, because I loved the ability to go to an offshore island in 3DS's New Leaf. It allowed you to cheat the seasons and nab summer beetles (worth a bundle of Bells!) year round. The nearby islands of New Horizons are a dull substitute.  Social Network  Animal Crossing: New Horizons has several different multiplayer modes , including local play on a single switch, where your friends can join with a single Joy Con. It's cool, but chaotic, and aside from showing off your island and taking group photos, there's not much to do but get in the way of each other. You can also visit other islands over a local connection (you have to be really close: About five feet away. If you lose the connection, you lose all the stuff you picked up on another island.) One of my favorite things about 3DS's New Leaf was its StreetPass mode which allowed you to passively view strangers' houses and order furniture you saw there. There's no convenient way to see random islands or order cool stuff from others like that in New Horizons, and that disappointingly cripples discovery. We'll just have to share our amazing homes, fashion choices, and island designs elsewhere.  Event Horizon Although I didn't encounter any major holidays during my review period with Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has announced that those are coming as free DLC updates (which means you cannot time travel to see them early; they don't exist yet). But I did take part in some amusing special events, including a meteor shower where I collected star fragments; a selfie-taking, influencer otter who gave me a fishing challenge; and a chameleon who paid top dollar for bugs. Along with classic visitors like Sahara, Gulliver and Wisp, there's always something going on in town."

        "Content": "It was always hard to find anything bad to say about 2015\u2019s Ori and the Blind Forest. Moon Studios\u2019 blend of an entrancing, tragic fairy tale world and white-knuckle platforming challenge left a mark that hasn\u2019t faded with time. And yet the new followup, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, successfully builds on that distinctive gameplay in a way that doesn\u2019t just retread the same ground. There\u2019s more breadth, detail, choice, and diversity than ever, and it\u2019s all done with engrossing color and light and an excellent, inspiring soundtrack. It may be two-dimensional, but this is a great, big, open world that\u2019s backed by a great, big, beautiful score that shifts to echo your successes and grows frantic and immediate in moments of tension. That music is your constant companion as you journey through diverse locations that sprawl out in all directions. Will of the Wisps paints with a full pallet of distinct biomes, transitioning seamlessly from the archetypical fairytale forests pierced with soft, golden streaks of light through the emerald canopy to the gloomy, ink-blotted muddy floor of the soggy marshlands. Each region bursts with fine detail that\u2019s easy to overlook because Moon Studios\u2019 aesthetic moods for each location are so consistent. All of them feel distinct and alive. For example, the frigid mountainous peaks Ori must breeze past on gusts of wind are littered with crisscrossing splintered alpine timber and pointed icicles that reach out to jab and poke from frozen overhangs. The claustrophobic, pitch-black tunnels of the Mouldwood Depths writhe with the bodies of thousands of insects whose chittering wings radiate a constant chorus of uncomfortable buzzing, and their sharps barbs sting if touched while Ori fumbles in the darkness. There\u2019s an incredible beauty and attention to these unique flourishes that serve the overarching theme of every region, from the closest foreground objects all the way back through the half-dozen layers of background art that slowly shift in parallax scrolling as you move. Whether you\u2019re burrowing through the sand in the blazing red light of the desert or nimbly swimming through chomping clams and bouncing between air bubbles, there\u2019s always something surprising in store.  Crawling With Life Ori and the Will of the Wisps reinforces that theme of a wider, living world with a menagerie of creatures to fight, big and small: dive-bombing mosquitos, slugs that spit caustic goo, dangling spiders, piranhas, spiky slimes, leaping elemental mantis-things, and hulking decay-touched bruisers with massive clubs kept me on my toes in every new place I visited. There\u2019s a healthy bestiary to test your mettle. But alongside these many enemies, friendly woodland critters and massive animal guardians hide and thrive in each area, ready to make your acquaintance. These non-player characters pop up frequently, telling you about their home lives, their current predicaments, the changes happening to the world at large, and tidbits of information concerning Ori\u2019s grand adventure. Often, these short conversations come with requests which serve as simple side quests to keep you invested in the here and now. You might be asked to find a lost acorn in a cave, or check on some family members in a faraway region, or hear a useful rumor about a shrine that\u2019s then marked on your map to investigate later. There\u2019s usually something worthwhile on the other side of these small side quests. \u201c No matter how seemingly insignificant they are in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s another layer of investment that Moon Studios has baked into the experience, which is so appreciated given so much of Ori involves simply getting from one point to the next as fast and fluidly as possible. Now you\u2019ve got an incentive to stop and really poke around or revisit the more secluded crannies of the world. And there\u2019s usually something worthwhile on the other side of these small errands: a bit of currency, a collectible item, a hearty thank you, and sometimes it\u2019s just the devastating realization that you can\u2019t save everyone. Ori and the Will of the Wisps Screenshot Gallery 9 Images In that same vein of grounding us in a living place, Ori and the Will of the Wisps introduces a kind of central hub village where many of your new critter friends end up once you\u2019ve completed a task for them. Here, you\u2019ll speak with merchants to purchase or upgrade abilities and turn in collectibles to community leaders who will, in turn, make improvements throughout the village that unlock new options. For example, turning in enough ore will let you either construct residential huts for more characters to call home, or remove the pesky thorn bushes that block your passage to hidden sections of the village. Finding seeds from each of the regions gives you the opportunity to grow new plants, vines, and trees in the village. Again, this isn\u2019t just cosmetic or fun story fluff; each new improvement adds ways to move through the village, opening up previously unreachable portions of it to explore, new NPCs to speak to, and hovels to repeatedly loot for currency. Building up this simple village gave me a sense of purpose and connection to the world \u2013 something to improve and care for, rather than just a series of places to leap and fight my way through until I reached the end.  Free Spirit In the wilder places the monstrous creatures call home, there\u2019s as much or more to explore. Each region is lousy with secret nooks, hidden just out of view or behind a clever bit of foreground. It\u2019s completely possible to rip through them en route to the ultimate goal at the end of the tunnel \u2013 and credit to Moon Studios for making huge sections of each environment completely optional \u2013 but the rewards for taking a peek in every crevice are vast. And in pure Metroid-like fashion, Ori\u2019s arsenal of abilities allows you to interact with the world in new ways as you uncover them through story progression or buy them as you go. Many of these are mandatory \u2013 you\u2019ll find a feather that lets you stoke fires to create updrafts in every playthrough of Ori and the Will of the Wisps, for example \u2013 but some are also totally voluntary. I\u2019m really impressed by Moon Studios\u2019 restraint here, because you can easily get by without opting into seemingly must-have abilities like the triple-jump and the barrier-crushing Spirit Smash. That said, if you do you\u2019ll miss quite a few hidden bits of the world. It made me feel like playing again would be worthwhile \u2013 likely on the harder difficulty since I opted to go with the default Normal of the three available settings \u2013 just to see how the experience would change. What The Heck Is Ori? Jumping Glow Rat Illuminated Shock Rodent Aesop Spirit Squirrel Flying Ghost Hamster Answer See Results Overcoming and avoiding the deadly obstacles is the meat on the Will of the Wisps\u2019 bones, and it all feels better than ever. As I was nearing the end of my 12-hour playthrough, the speed and possibilities for creative movement put me in an almost Zen-like state: triple-jumps, burrowing through sand, dashing through water, launching myself into the air at will, bashing off of enemies to reach new heights and hurl them in the opposite direction, and grappling fixed positions and enemies with a lasso had all become second nature. Muscle memory compounded until I stopped thinking and just reacted. \u201c It\u2019s a gradual ramp-up from sluggish sprite to free-running-dynamo, but as I unlocked each new ability the muscle memory compounded until I really stopped thinking about what I was doing and just reacted to whatever was being thrown my way. That\u2019s an amazing feeling, especially during the series\u2019 excellent signature chase sequences when the stakes go through the roof and one false move means you\u2019re crushed under a collapsing environment, buried in an avalanche or consumed by the pursuing mandibles of a mammoth spider. It\u2019s easy to take each carefully constructed segment of the world for granted but these moments really highlight just how damn good Ori and Will the Wisps\u2019 fluid movement and level design can be. Each element is placed precisely to be used in a specific way, yet all the while I felt like a genius for being able to read the environment at a frantic pace and adapt to the next obstacle accordingly. And that feeling is further ratcheted up in the optional Spirit Trials found in every region, where you can race through a carefully constructed course against the ghosts of other players competing for the best time. It\u2019s a fun side activity to hone your platforming skills and break up the story content if you want to. Between the flips, dashes, and grapples of getting from point A to point B, you\u2019re going to have to fight. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll see that combat in Will of the Wisps has been expanded along the same lines as the other abilities. In Ori and the Blind Forest your offensive options are modest, but in Will of the Wisps an entire wheel of weapon-like abilities can be unlocked for you to mix up combat, and equipped on the fly in the midst of a fight.  Sling Blade You\u2019ll start with the fast-slashing Spirit Edge sword which functions as a basic attack \u2013 until, that is, you\u2019re offered optional alternatives like that hefty, slow-swinging Spirit Smash and explosive ranged elements like the Spirit Spike that hurls a massive lance of energy toward an opponent at the cost of a lot of energy. Or you could take the hefty, slow-swinging Spirit Smash that hammers enemies into the air and lets you perform airborne ground pounds. You\u2019ll find plenty of ranged options as well, like the Spirit Arc bow that fires arrows of light, the Blaze ability that will light nearby enemies on fire, a deployable sentry that constantly peppers opponents with nagging beams of damaging light, and so much more. The diversity and utility of each ability makes many of them must-haves. \u201c Looking back I regret that, at first, I didn\u2019t venture too far out of my starting abilities because they worked. But the diversity and utility of each ability, both in and out of combat, makes many of them must-haves. For example, not only does that heavy Spirit Smash deliver big damage and knock enemies up, but it\u2019s also used to crush through breakable barriers. And though the Spike ability that allows Ori to hurl a massive spirit lance costs a ton of energy to use, it regularly saved my life in several of the multi-phased boss battles where I used it to stagger the massive monsters mid-attack and buy some breathing room. And alongside these active abilities, Will of the Wisps tweaks an old formula in the form of Spirit Shards that bestow passive attributes to Ori as you find or buy them and equip them in the few precious slots you get. These abilities run the gamut from combat-focused to pure utility and really allow you to customize your little spirit\u2026 squirrel...thing in unique ways to suit your playstyle. IGN's Top 25 Xbox One Games 28 Images For example, I immediately equipped the shard that let me cling to walls for fairly obvious reasons, alongside the upgradeable shard that reduced incoming damage by 10/20/25-percent. When I could finally afford it, I traded a whole bunch of currency for the shard that let me jump a third time before touching the ground \u2013 that one just felt like a no-brainer for reaching unreachable places. But there are many shards with quirky traits that I eagerly tried out to see what kind of fun builds I could put together. There are shards that increase your damage output at the cost of taking more damage, shards that give you more resources from slain enemies, and shards that give you a bit of a hint when you\u2019re near a secret wall or tunnel. There\u2019s a Spirit Shard for seemingly every occasion, and while you start with a scant three slots to embed, as you uncover and conquer the wave-based Combat Shrines throughout the world your reward is more slots that let you extensively fine-tune your Ori. Eventually, I got to the point where there were some shards I just couldn\u2019t live without, and so the additional options let me experiment with the unique ones liberally as needed, without having to lose my favorite passive abilities.  The Bittersweet Science I\u2019m hesitant to talk at all about the finer points of Ori and the Will of the Wisps\u2019 story since so much of the journey is propelled by the crests and troughs of its emotional waves. So, without venturing too deeply into spoiler territory, it should be no surprise for those who played Ori and the Blind Forest that Moons Studios\u2019 knack for brewing joy and sorrow in heavy proportions is alive and well in Ori\u2019s new tale. Moon Studios has delivered an excellent second chapter that plucks the same tragically beautiful heartstrings of hope and loss and redemption. It\u2019s an affecting mixture of sorrow and joy that shines a light on, I think more than anything, the power of empathy; it was hard not to pour care and concern over either side of the good-bad divide, and bounce so consistently between feelings of heartache and elation, even if that\u2019s the intent. It's hard not to pour care and concern over either side of the good-bad divide. \u201c What I really appreciate about Will of the Wisps is that even though it\u2019s a tale of light versus darkness, it never fully falls into the simplicity of good versus evil. Sometimes bad things happen, or have happened, and there\u2019s just no fixing them regardless of how hard you try or desperately want them righted. It\u2019s a really powerful sentiment to deliver in a gorgeously colorful video game filled with cartoonish anthropomorphic forest folk, but somehow Moon Studios continues to subvert that expectation. Instead, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is content to show that heroes can be kind of broken and still rise to the occasion, and that sometimes the ostensible bad guys have hearts, families, and their own personal tragedies, regardless of whether they choose to seek redemption. And I really appreciate these stories for that reason \u2013 there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect ending for everyone."

        "Content": "What is Dreams? Well, It's pots of paints, a ball of clay, a games compendium, a music studio, a creative classroom, an animation programme, a social network, your first footsteps into game development. And crucially, often incredible. Media Molecule\u2019s follow up to the LittleBigPlanet series follows its established mantra of play, create, and share, but takes it to an all-new level. Whatever path you choose to take, getting lost down it is easily done as new bursts of joy are discovered around every corner. Like a Mary Poppinsesque bottomless bag of creativity, you never quite know what you\u2019ll end up playing when booting up Dreams, or what inspiration will be sparked inside you to sculpt, paint, or engineer yourself. It\u2019s a highly ambitious concept, and one that has been magically brought to life. When starting up Dreams for the first time, you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing where to start. After a short string of basic, yet important tutorials, the most alluring and arguably best place to head is Art\u2019s Dream - the two to three-hour story mode created by Media Molecule all within Dreams itself. You follow the titular Art, a down-and-out musician who\u2019s recently abandoned his post as a double bass player in a jazz troupe, as he goes slaloming through three distinct settings: a fairytale-like rural area, an industrial world laden with steam trains and neon-soaked cobbles, and a digital forest where steel takes the place of wood and LEDs flicker like owls eyes watching from their branches. The trio of plotlines intertwine to tell a surprisingly melancholic and emotionally involving story and is a much more mature one than seen in previous Media Molecule games. It\u2019s a beautifully told tale that isn\u2019t afraid to tackle some serious subjects, which it manifests throughout via visual spectacles such as the dreaded Thornbeak, a charcoal-feathered oversized crow that was the source of Art\u2019s childhood nightmares. It\u2019s a beautifully told tale that isn\u2019t afraid to tackle some serious subjects. \u201c In order to battle those inner and outer demons, you\u2019ll run the gamut of game genres along the way. There\u2019s everything from classic point-and-click adventure to puzzle-platforming, some twin-stick shooting, and even a sprinkling of bullet hell. It all crescendos in a final half hour of explosive psychedelia that results in what I imagine giving Pink Floyd the dev tools to Sayonara Wild Hearts would feel like. It\u2019s infused with song throughout, with absurdist musical numbers punctuating the story, such as a take on \u201890s east coast rap and a haunting jazz piece that I still find myself humming the bassline of with regularity. While never providing much of a challenge, Art\u2019s Dream does a fantastic job of blending solid combat and puzzles with a compelling plot. Most impressive, though, are its distinct and varied audio-visual stylings, which act as a great way to showcase just what is possible with Dreams\u2019 creation tools.  Back to School When first casting your eye over Dreams\u2019 creation suite, it can be a worryingly overwhelming proposition. This isn\u2019t a game where you can afford to dive in blind. But after completing the first set of basic tutorials it all started to make sense. The multitude of multicoloured glyphs that sit at the top of the screen soon meant things to me and I actually found myself enjoying the tutorials rather than them being tiresome chores as they can often be in other games. The key to this being that even while it\u2019s teaching you the basics, Dreams is encouraging you to be creative at every turn \u2013 nudging you to not simply follow instructions when building a simple bridge or painting a garden, but teaching you to be willing to put your own spin on it. Dreams is encouraging you to be creative at every turn. \u201c Media Molecule has done an outstanding job at teaching you the basics and in some cases so more advanced techniques, with the most complex batch of tutorials being a series of Masterclasses led by developers who take you step by step through their respective areas of expertise. These include Sculpting a Male Bust, Stylistic Scene Creation, Sculpting and Level Assembly, and Remixing Dreamiverse Dash (one of the Media Molecule designed games included). As of now there are only these four masterclasses available, which is a shame because I\u2019ve found them to be the most engaging lessons, whether creating alongside or simply watching the artists at work. Another of my favourite sub-menus of tutorials are the \u201cHow To..\u201d videos. These range from beginner-level creations such as making a window to more advanced techniques like \u201cHow To... Make a Shooty Cannon\u201d. Pleasingly, these are much more abundant than their Masterclass cousins and I\u2019d especially recommend them if you\u2019re planning on delving into the game-making side of Dreams. Overall, there\u2019s no shortage of tutorials to get sucked into when you begin Dreams, with the vast majority being informative without stepping into patronising, and really good help you find your feet in what can be an intimidating place at first. Even after absorbing a lot of tutorials, though, controlling Dreams can initially feel unintuitive. To some extent this is to be expected: Dreams is attempting to do things that a home console has never done before, so naturally it will have button inputs that are unfamiliar. I spent a while trying to work out which of the three different ways to control Dreams was best for me. The default, which involves using the DualShock 4\u2019s motion controls to move my Imp (your smiley, colourful cursor) around the screen, ended up being my chosen weapon after spending time with each, but in truth I found it hard to find the perfect combination for me. At first it can feel cumbersome to move an Imp with motion controls while at the same time moving around in 3D with the left stick and rotating around it with the right. I quickly got more used to the control scheme when using the DualShock 4, but never felt I could be as precise as I wanted to with the motion controls when trying to be delicate with a paint brush. I\u2019d often find myself slashing a swath of colour across my canvas where all I wanted to do was add a small detail. Thankfully, the trusty undo button comes to your aide in times like this, but having to try a dozen times to get it right is still aggravating. One way to improve this is to use the PlayStation Move controllers if you have a pair lying around. These allow you to be much more deliberate in your actions, but in turn come with their own unwieldy control scheme that never quite clicked with me. The third and final option is a new addition since early access and means using the DualShock but with motion controls removed, where your Imp is moved using the left stick. It allows for small details to be made easier, and straight lines to be created with much more ease, but altogether it feels like the flowing, magic wand-like feel of Dreams is lost. Once I found what felt right for me, I had a go at building something from scratch, which resulted in a series of unsuccessful projects at first. In the days after, however, I felt myself learning and picking up techniques, crucially feeling like I was making progress and never feeling lost. I was by no means creating masterpieces but I was having a great time doing it, and that\u2019s the crucial part. The act of sculpting and painting was fun and, even if the final product wasn\u2019t as impressive as I\u2019d envisioned, it was still an entirely enjoyable process. After all, the best part of a LEGO set is building it \u2013 otherwise you\u2019d just buy a toy ready-built. After all, the best part of a LEGO set is building it \u2013 otherwise you\u2019d just buy a toy ready-built. \u201c Sculpting is done by first choosing a shape and its material and smearing it onto the screen in a satisfying motion. You can then add and subtract shapes from it or mould it more freely if you wish to get the exact shape you\u2019re looking for. Once achieving a form you\u2019re happy with you can add coats, styles, and effects if you wish. There\u2019s a variety on offer and you\u2019ll soon learn which does what, and the corresponding look and feel it will give your dream. A shiny wax surface accompanied with the flow effect and the addition of the comb tool can create a river with a current, for example. Even small simple objects like flowers and bowling balls that I was forming delivered their own levels of satisfaction. Whether that be when receiving a thumbs up from someone who had stumbled across my creation in Dreams\u2019 built-in browser, or that unique thrill of someone using it in one of their own dreams. This is the crux of what makes Dreams so special to me. The sense of sharing and community is unlike pretty much anything I\u2019ve seen in a game before. The ability to take any asset uploaded to the server and remix it for your needs is a thing of beauty. Whether it be a piece of landscape, a character, or a sound effect amongst myriad other categories. If the idea of creating a whole fully workable game sounds daunting or you simply have no interest in doing so, there\u2019s so much more you can try your hand at. You can become a tree specialist, a voiceover artist, or a music maker in the fully kitted out audio studio and contribute to other people\u2019s whole fully workable games. For me, it was the painting side of creation I found myself drawn to most in my time with Dreams. There\u2019s something satisfying about the way flecks of paints are applied to the screen, which varies depending on the angle of your controller and amount of pressure you place on the trigger. It feels like you\u2019re actually brushing the strokes and feels wonderfully fluid as you sweep each layer of colour onto the other. I won\u2019t be in a position to forge any Rembrandts any time soon, but once again I had a great time using the tools and was not necessarily concerned by my less-than-stellar results.  That\u2019s not to say that stunning works of art can\u2019t be made in Dreams. The tools are there and there\u2019s no shortage of proof that they work. The quality and variety on show when browsing through the \u201cDreamiverse\u201d (the server where all Dreams creations are stored) is immediately apparent. It inspired me to persevere and get better where it would feel easy to give up. A bad workman blames their tools, after all.  Share Play Many will see the prospect of being able to make their own games as the most enticing aspect of Dreams. Never before has this been attempted on consoles, at least not to this level of scale and complexity and open-endedness. No longer are the LittleBigPlanet-shaped chains of side-scrolling platforming tied around your ambitions when it comes to Media Molecule\u2019s in-game game-making. Just from a quick browse of the Dreamiverse hub screen you can see the range of game genres and artistic styles people have already achieved. From the remarkably polished Wipeout homage \u201cSlidEout 3019\u201d to the sloth-led, Captain Toad inspired mascot platformer \u201cPip Gemwalker\u201d, the level of depth displayed is astounding. Even though you shouldn\u2019t expect to reach these heights straightaway, it\u2019s empowering to know that it can be done. No longer are the LittleBigPlanet-shaped chains of side-scrolling platforming tied around your ambitions. \u201c Once again, the tutorials are key when first stepping into Dreams game design \u2013 especially if, like me, you\u2019re taking your first baby steps into making a game of any kind. If you played a LittleBigPlanet game you\u2019ll be on familiar ground to start with, however, as the basics you\u2019re taught relate to basic platformers, whether that be programming a character with a jump function or connecting a button to a bridge that lowers upon pressing. This is where \u2018logic\u2019 comes into play and things start to get exponentially more complicated. Mercifully, the lessons are taught at a kind pace and I never found myself lost in the tangle of wires and cables connecting objects together at first. The more ambitious I got, however, the less I started to build from scratch and started to take advantage of maybe Dreams\u2019 biggest asset: that ability to use others\u2019 assets to create your own. The shareability of all items uploaded and made public means that you don\u2019t have to \u2013 nor are you expected to \u2013 create a whole game independently from scratch. Alongside a couple of Media Molecule provided templates, such as a basic first-person shooter, you can also remix creations by the community. My first \u2018game\u2019 was a combination of the aforementioned FPS template, another user\u2019s small platforming section, and a gigantic wedge of waxy cheese that I sculpted, which rotates when stepping on a button. You can then shoot at the cheese, because why wouldn\u2019t you? It was in this moment that I fell in love with Dreams\u2019 creation suite. I realised that I could make as weird an experience as possible and no one was there to say \u201cno\u201d. While I don\u2019t possess a great amount of interest in programming logic or carefully sculpting detailed characters (nor do I have the time), it\u2019s the ability to create using others people\u2019s creations that I\u2019ve enjoyed the most. Placing Batman on Tatooine with R2-D2 under the shadow of a Christmas tree being projected by the planet\u2019s twin suns, for example. Dreams is a kit basher\u2019s paradise and a place for worlds to collide in increasingly odd ways. Of course, you don\u2019t even have to create anything at all if you don\u2019t want to, but instead chose to watch, play, and experience all manner of dreams created by others.  Making Waves Surfing through the Dreamiverse of community created content can become an absolute time-suck in the best way possible. Akin to spelunking down wikiholes or losing yourself in YouTube algorithms, you pick a starting point \u2013 whether that be something grand like high science-fiction or a more mundane notion like an apple - and before you know it you\u2019ve enjoyed a dozen unique games or pieces of art before finding yourself stood inside Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night. You may only spend 30 seconds in some creations, but as someone\u2019s imagination gets its hooks in you you might spend 30 minutes exploring another. 14 Community Creations Made In Dreams 14 Images Just as you can create whatever you like in Dreams, you can view pretty much whatever you want as well. There are all sorts of games enveloping every genre imaginable, from cute character platformers to first-person military shooters, to even hour-plus-long action RPGs. There\u2019s also, of course, a large helping of imitations and re-imaginings of established franchises such as the Batman Arkham series or the Sonic franchise \u2013 seriously, there\u2019s so many Sonic games. If you feel like being a bit more cultured, though, you can browse though the art section and effectively spend a day at a gallery without leaving your sofa as vast watercolours and ridiculously detailed sculptures fill your screen. Then there\u2019s some dreams that combine the two and offer completely singular experiences that you just wouldn\u2019t be able to find anywhere else. The most pertinent example of this perhaps being \u201cHaus of Bevis\u201d, a walking sim of sorts that begins as a tour of a sculpture gallery before taking a sinister turn. I won\u2019t spoil it, as it\u2019s really something that you should experience for yourself. You never know quite what you\u2019re going to get, and that\u2019s the unique joy of Dream Surfing. \u201c You never know quite what you\u2019re going to get, and that\u2019s the unique joy of Dream Surfing. I\u2019ve played BABATUNDE The Father Has Returned, an arena fighter, multiple times due to its fluid-feeling movement and dynamic power-kick animation, but also spent the best part of 15 minutes staring at a fully realised cooked breakfast as my eyes glaze over at the sight of a puddle of baked beans. There\u2019s also the \u201cAutosurf\u201d button, the variation on Google\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky\u201d which selects you a random taster of the Dreamiverse. It\u2019s like a friend offering chocolate to you from a box without knowing what flavour each is; it\u2019s a lucky dip. You may get one of your favourites, and savour it, or get one that you\u2019re not overly keen on, but at the end of the day it\u2019s free chocolate and how bad can that be? If you want to take less of a chance, however, then there\u2019s a helpful tagging system for all creations that lets you be more specific with what you\u2019re looking for. Looking for a shooter? Then search \u201cshooter\u201d. Want it to be third-person? Then add that. Looking for something with aliens in? Simply add \u201calien\u201d as a keyword, and so on and so on until you find something that catches your eye. Adding more tags will help you narrow down your search until you\u2019ve found the exact thing you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s a smart system that, along with the numbers of thumbs up a dream has received, gives you a clearer indication of what might be worth spending your valuable time on. There\u2019s a level of weirdness on offer that you wouldn\u2019t normally find on the PlayStation, even in the less-trodden recesses of the PSN store. For example, I\u2019ve controlled a three-inch-tall man holding a ham-joint walking around the inside of a cardboard box while hurling insults and trying to pick a fight with a pair of giant hairy feet that tower over me. It\u2019s these bizarre dioramas mixed with jankier creations that add a sense of charm to Dreams and often ended up being some of my favourites. It reminded me of browsing through Vine and stumbling across a particularly odd six seconds that I couldn\u2019t wait to share with others. On the other end of the scale, the overall quality level of some players\u2019 creations after only a year in early access is astonishing and I often found myself exclaiming, \u201cHow have they done this?!\u201d as I found new things that amazed me. It\u2019s a testament to the tools that Media Molecule has provided that all of this is possible, but also to the community of Dreams and their boundless imaginations. The sense of community really is there in the rawest sense of the word as well, that\u2019s clear to see when taking a peek into the genealogy of some of the larger playable projects, such as The Pig Detective series. There are almost \u2018micro game studios\u2019 operating within the Dreamiverse already with numerous people contributing small pieces to create a more impressive whole. These range from people scoring the music to games for others, to more granular aspects like fine-tuning the walking animation of a character. A genuine sense of community that I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve experienced before in a game. \u201c It\u2019s that ability to combine and design with others that gives Dreams a genuine sense of community that I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve experienced before in a game. LittleBigPlanet took baby steps towards a create, share and play ecosystem, but Dreams builds on it in almost every tangible way and feels like a burgeoning social network as much as it does a place to play games. It promises so much more as well. People are already performing live music concerts from their bedrooms using Dreams, and it\u2019s begun seeping its way into education with virtual career fairs being made and sign-language learning tools available. It\u2019s exciting to think that there is already so much to see, do, and create in Dreams, and it hasn\u2019t even really got going yet. Media Molecule has planted the seeds by creating the tools necessary for players to express themselves. It\u2019s now up to the community to grow these ideas and help Dreams flourish by creating, sharing, playing and having a ton of fun whilst doing so."

        "Content": "Gears 5 managed to pleasantly surprise me, both in terms of its gameplay and its story. For a series that\u2019s now six total entries deep, that\u2019s impressive. The Coalition pulled it off by taking the time to develop its trio of young heroes beyond the foundations established in Gears of War 4 and having the guts to alter the course of the series in a way I didn\u2019t expect. And while it makes no attempt to fix what isn\u2019t broken with the rock-solid cover-based shooting gameplay, it does augment it in interesting ways and experiments with an open-world structure. Combine all of that with a broad set of multiplayer modes that range from the trusty old stalwarts to bold and spicy new takes on both co-op and competitive gameplay, and what\u2019s presented is a tremendous package that stands as one of the year\u2019s best action games. Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever 10 Images We\u2019ve got in-depth reviews of both the single-player and multiplayer modes. First, here\u2019s what we said about the campaign:  Gears 5 Campaign Review Gears\u2019s third-person action has evolved slowly but steadily from one entry to the next, and in Gears 5 the bulk of what\u2019s new flows through Jack, your handy floating robot companion. He can now snag weapons from the battlefield for you and unlock safes, among other actions, and you\u2019ll earn new abilities for him to use in combat, such as flash-blinding your foes, reviving you and your allies when you\u2019re down, cloaking you, and more. Upgrade components are littered across the world, so you can decide to hyper-specialize in a few areas or have a little bit of every ability. I appreciated the extra tactical layers he offered, and while I did vary my selected Jack ability depending on the situation, I was particularly thankful for the healing power of Stim in the latter part of the campaign, which saved me from dying more than once.  Here\u2019s more on Campaign from my campaign review (or watch the video version above). [And] boy oh boy does Gears\u2019 combat still feel good. This may be the only series where I\u2019m always happy to have the default weapon \u2013 the trusty Lancer \u2013 in my loadout at all times, just in case I get a chance to chainsaw a bad guy in half. The Overkill shotgun returns from Gears of War 4 and packs a potent punch, while classics like the Longshot, Boomshot, and Mulcher are still around to satisfyingly chew your foes into little fleshy chunks. New weapons like the Claw manage to feel unique but fit right in, too; Gears 5 does a tremendous job of balancing the old toys with new ones. Also new is Gears 5\u2019s open structure of its middle two acts. You\u2019ll roam the area on your wind-powered Skiff, free to tackle optional secondary objectives that vary in duration and challenge. Usually your reward is Jack upgrades, so they\u2019re very worth doing. This is a nice change of pace for Gears, just like it was for God of War last year -- who\u2019s to say whether that was by intention or coincidence, but the fact that the first of these sections is set in a frozen tundra only makes it harder to ignore the similarity). Multiple varied boss fights also help Gears 5 feel fresh throughout. Gears 5 Review Screenshots 26 Images   Campaign score: 8.8  Gears 5 Multiplayer Review Arcade is the standout of Gears 5\u2019s iteration of Versus. This new mode is a more casual and chaotic game type that welcomes those who feel they\u2019re always the Gnashed, never the Gnasher, with open arms. Instead of starting everybody with the standard Lancer/Gnasher loadout, you\u2019re given an arsenal based on your character, which can be changed at any point between deaths during the match. Don\u2019t expect to see premium weapons littered on the map with a timer attached to them, either; instead, you buy special weapons and equipment like a Markza MK1 (my weapon of choice) or incendiary grenades with skulls earned by downing and killing enemies. You\u2019re even rewarded with a skull if you die a lot, which can help prevent the feeling of being stuck in a dead-end loop. Your skulls persist through deaths too, giving people who don\u2019t necessarily excel at getting consecutive kills a chance to get a fun piece of equipment. There's also a lobby for co-op versus against bots, so if you\u2019re bringing a new friend into Gears there\u2019s a place for them to learn how to ease into competitive play instead of just tossing them into the meat grinder.  Read more about multiplayer from Miranda Sanchez\u2019s multiplayer review (or watch the video version above). The most exciting of the [Horde] characters, though, is Jack. Your robot buddy from the campaign is a key support character in multiplayer too and is a ton of fun when facing off with your team against wave after wave of fodder. Instead of equipping weapons, Jack has a built-in laser he can use to stun and damage enemies and a repair tool that can heal allies and rebuild fortifications. Better yet, his ultimate ability allows him to assume control of an enemy unit for a limited amount of time \u2013 which is enough to do cool stuff like take control of a Bastion and have it self-destruct in the middle of a bunch of Swarm. At first glance he seems like the character you\u2019d assign to a less experienced player, which is not a bad idea because he can hang back and lend a hand without taking as much direct fire. But in the hands of an experienced player, he can be used to pull off some really awesome strategies, especially since he automatically goes invisible after being left alone for some time. I\u2019d use his increased mobility to flank tough enemies and to collect important weapons for my teammates.  Multiplayer score: 9.0   Microtransaction Reaction  By Mitchell Saltzman In multiplayer, Gears 5\u2019s progression system is extensive, confusing, and feels designed to turn all of us into gears, each grinding away endlessly to try and collect what are, ultimately, a collection of pretty underwhelming rewards. Fortunately the microtransactions barely affect it There\u2019s an in-game store that lets you purchase skins, markers, bloodsprays, emotes, and other cosmetic customization features with a premium currency called Iron. 100 Iron equates to about a buck, and the price of an \u201cEpic\u201d rarity level skin is about 1,000 Iron. So if you\u2019re looking to buy anything significant, you\u2019re looking to drop at least $10. It\u2019s not cheap, but also not essential. The only thing you can buy that affects gameplay even slightly are experience boosts that last one day, seven days, or 30 days, for 250, 600, and 1,200 Iron, respectively. I have no idea why you\u2019d ever want to do that given that in Gears 5\u2019s leveling system, levelling up is largely meaningless. Even the rewards for \u201cReupping,\u201d or reaching the max level and then resetting your level back to 1 in order to do it all again, amounting to little more than a new bloodspray. So you can spend money to do that faster. Everything else in Gears 5 can\u2019t be bought and must be earned by playing through the grind heavy Tour of Duty, which is essentially Gears 5\u2019s version of a Battle Pass (except it\u2019s free). You\u2019re given three Tour Objectives to complete per day that each offer a certain number of stars. The objectives themselves are often nothing to scoff at, like killing 90 Drone Elites, but are still generally obtainable within a few hours of play \u2013 and you\u2019re given the option to swap a hard objective out for a random one, but the more you do this the more Iron it costs.. Progression feels alright, but only for a little while: you only get three challenges per day, so if you wanted to take a day and just plow through them to earn stars, you can\u2019t. Once you collect enough stars to move up a rank you collect that rank\u2019s reward and move on to the next one, in typical battle pass fashion. Unfortunately, the rewards are underwhelming to say the least. For the first eight ranks you get nothing but lame banners, bloodsprays, a salute emote, and then finally when you achieve the rank of Sergeant III, you get your first skin: Fahz in his desert armor from the campaign. It\u2019s not even a new skin! It\u2019s just a recycled skin from the campaign, one that would fit right in if it was available right from the start. This holds true throughout the entirety of rewards in this first Tour of Duty. There are a bunch of banners and bloodsprays (few of which are any better than the ones you start with), basic emotes, recycled campaign skins, a few new executions that you can\u2019t preview, and a grand total of 500 Iron -- not even enough to buy a single skin from the store. So all together, Gears 5\u2019s microtransaction system feels like even more of a mess than what\u2019s come to be expected. The rewards in this first Tour of Duty don\u2019t match up with the absurd amount of time that would be required to earn them, and the items that are only purchasable in the store don\u2019t feel special enough to warrant an extra $10 per pop on a game that already costs $60.

        "Content": "The SEGA Genesis Mini (or Sega Mega Drive Mini, as it's known outside North America) is the best all-in-one retro console ever made. With a line-up of 42 games (some of which never saw proper Western releases), great UI and software handled by legendary software company M2, catchy menu music composed on original hardware by a Genesis musical legend, and some trademark M2 surprises, this is the high watermark against which all retro mini consoles should be measured going forward. It's not perfect, but it easily rises above all the others.  Check out the video above to see why the SEGA Genesis Mini is the best retro console on the market right now.  Genesis Does... The tiny SEGA Genesis Mini takes its design very seriously, with spring-loaded cartridge bay doors that swing closed, a movable volume control (that doesn't actually do anything) and even an expansion bay door that pops off for no reason at all (at least for the US release, the Japanese version has an optional, completely non-functioning \"Tower of Power\" version available).  Watch the video below to get an overview of the Sega Genesis Mini. The included Genesis controllers look and feel like the real deal, and my first thought on holding one in my hands after all these years was \"wow these things are big.\" It's a bummer the superior 6-button controllers aren't included, but for basically 40 of the 42 included games, the pack-in controllers work fine. It makes Street Fighter 2 and Eternal Champions a much better experience, but you're only going to play Eternal Champions once, anyway.   Retro-Bit Official USB Genesis Controller SEGA sent a pair of 6-button controllers (8 when you count the shoulder buttons), and while they aren't necessary to the Genesis Mini experience, I absolutely recommend picking up at least one. The extra buttons are a nice touch, but the controller just feels better in my hands. Best of all, the 'Mode' button brings up your menu options with a single press, rather than the press-and-hold approach needed with the pack-in controllers. The Retro-Bit controllers are officially licensed for use with the Genesis Mini, and since they're USB, they'll work with your PC and even Nintendo Switch. If you have a spare $20, I highly recommend outfitting your Genesis Mini with one.  Inside the box there's also an HDMI cable, USB power cable, and an AC adapter. The only thing it lacks is a cool, period-specific poster like the Super Nintendo and NES Classics. As a collector of video game detritus, nothing excites me more than a poster I'll never get around to hanging up. The main menu screen is a delight. When the Genesis Mini starts up, the game icons burst from the center of the screen and take their places in the UI. A catchy tune by Streets of Rage 2 composer Yuzo Koshiro plays over the main menu, and you can sort the games alphabetically, by release date, genre, or number of players. It's fully animated, too: when you change the sorting options, the boxes quickly move into their new order. There's even an option to sort them by spine, letting you see all the available games at once as though they're sitting on a shelf. Navigating back to the main menu from inside one of the games is a simple matter of holding the 'Start' button for a few seconds on one of the pair of included 3-button controllers. Personally, I recommend picking up the officially licensed Retro-Bit USB Genesis controller for a million different reasons, the best of which is that hitting its \u201cMode\u201d button accomplishes with a quick press what holding down the Start button does on the included controllers. There's also an option to play 4:3 or 16:9, although you'd have to be a cop to play in 16:9. \u201c So far I haven't found any surprises in the in-game menus. You can save, load, reset or return to a game, or return to the main menu. Standard stuff. Back in the settings menu, the filter and wallpaper options are also pretty standard, and are one place I wish M2 had added a little extra. You can choose from one of two wallpapers, or no wallpaper at all. There's also an option to play 4:3 or 16:9, although you'd have to be a cop to play in 16:9. There's no pixel-perfect option, which is weird since almost all emulation software includes the pixel-perfect option, but you can toggle a CRT filter on or off. This just adds faux-scanlines to the games, giving the rough estimation of playing them on a period-appropriate display. It's a nice touch, one I almost always opt for when playing old-school games. However, it makes games a little too dark, since so much of the screen is replaced with tiny black lines. Every Sega Genesis Mini Game Start Screen 42 Images  Genesis Does! With the Genesis Mini, SEGA opted for quantity AND quality, giving us exactly twice as many games as the SNES Classic, its closest competitor. While the list is chock-full of familiar Genesis classics, M2 and SEGA went ahead and added a few games never before released on Western shores. In the case of Darius, it was never ported to the Genesis or Mega Drive at all. With so many games from all across the lifetime of the SEGA Genesis, it's hard to complain about the included library. There are hundreds, probably thousands, of hours of gameplay locked inside. So how about those games, huh? It's a super-solid line-up, spanning a wide release period and including games you will definitely expect like Sonic and Sonic 2, to games maybe you kind-of remember like Alyssia Dragoon, right up to the never-before released in the west version of Tetris for SEGA Genesis. They all play mostly as you remember them. Sega Genesis Mini On Walmart Free 2-day Shipping See It Unfortunately, I did notice some weird emulation glitches, particularly in Sonic. If you capture a chaos emerald in one of the bonus levels, for example, it blinks in and out of existence on the score screen. The checkerboard pattern on Dr. Robotnik's wrecking ball in the first boss fight also flickers in and out of existence, rendering the ball shiny and brown rather than checkered. Weird but infrequent emulation issues aside, the games you remember fondly won't disappoint. I'm excited to finally grind my way through Phantasy Star IV after missing out on it the first time around. It really is hard to find fault this lineup, even if some of the earlier games, like Altered Beast and Golden Axe, are pretty clunky nowadays. But both of those games are historically important to the Genesis. Long before Sonic wowed us with his rude attitude and blast-processing, Altered Beast was the pack-in game with the Genesis. Every Confirmed Game for Sega Genesis Mini 42 Images The bonus games, Darius and Tetris, are also important, but for different reasons. I will say the Genesis version of Tetris, which never officially released in the US, is maybe the most disappointing game of the bunch. Of all the dozens of Tetris versions I've played over the decades, I think it might be my least favorite way to play Tetris. Historically, it's significant. Gameplay-wise? Just try it once and then move along.   Sega Genesis Mini Games List   Ecco the Dolphin  Castlevania: Bloodlines (Castlevania: The New Generation in AU/UK)  Space Harrier 2  Shining Force  Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine  Toe Jam & Earl  Comix Zone  Sonic the Hedgehog  Altered Beast  Gunstar Heroes  Sonic the Hedgehog 2  Earthworm Jim  Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse  World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck  Thunder Force III  Super Fantasy Zone  Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master  Streets of Rage 2  Contra Hard Corps (Probotector in AU/UK)  Landstalker  Mega Man: The Wily Wars  Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition  Sonic Spinball  Phantasy Star IV  Beyond Oasis (The Story of Thor in AU/UK)  Ghouls 'N Ghosts  Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle  Golden Axe  Vectorman  Wonder Boy in Monster World  Tetris  Darius  Virtua Fighter 2  Alisia Dragoon  Monster World IV  Kid Chameleon  Road Rash II  Eternal Champions  Columns  Dynamite Headdy  Strider  Light Crusader   There are other Genesis games included with the collection you may have never played before due to the fact they weren't widely released. Mega Man: The Wily Wars, a 16-bit remaster of the first three NES Mega Man games, was a SEGA Channel exclusive. In all my life I've never known anyone who had a SEGA Channel subscription. Monster World IV, another included game, never actually came out for the SEGA Genesis. It eventually found its way West via the Wii Virtual Console, but if you didn't buy it then, there's been no legitimate way to play it. Now you can play it in HD. The Genesis Mini gives us a chance to visit the US versions of games nearly impossible to obtain otherwise.  You Can't Do This on Nintendo One of the most surprising features of the SEGA Genesis Mini, and true to M2's reputation of going above and beyond, is the fact you actually get even more content when you change the language options in the system menu. There's no reason for the changes to exist, since different regions are getting different versions of the console. And yet, they're included, and it's such an unexpectedly cool addition. For example, if you change the menu to Japanese, the entire UI changes to match the Japanese Mega Drive, right down to the box art on the games. Even the ROM versions change to match the region, so Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine becomes Puyo Puyo. Even subtle differences give away the fact the Genesis Mini has more ROMs than expected: the Japanese version of Sonic has parallax-scrolling clouds, while the US lacks the feature. It's so completely unnecessary and I love it."

        "Content": "Stubbornly refusing to reinvent itself after a five-year absence, Borderlands 3 sticks to its guns and manages to outdo itself. Refined movement and shooting, a legion of enjoyably challenging enemies, and the single largest arsenal of mechanically distinct firearms I\u2019ve ever seen in a video game easily make this the best in a great series of co-op shooters. Its trademark stylized art, on-the-nose humor, and tattoo-fueled storyline are all enjoyable enough in their own right, but what really makes Borderlands 3 excellent is the addicting item chase that unfolds over the course of 30 hours\u2019 worth of lovingly crafted main and side missions. What\u2019s more, this is an adventure I could see myself happily undertaking again from scratch with a new character and a fresh group of friends. Every IGN Borderlands Review 29 Images  You\u2019ll arrive on the familiar planet of Pandora to find it overrun by bandits and on the verge of total collapse\u2026 so, normal. But this time around you aren\u2019t stuck on Pandora. You\u2019ll venture to several varied and jaw-droppingly beautiful planets, from the grimey neon metropolis of Promethea to the cherry-blossom-speckled peaks of Athenas, and each stands out visually in a way the series rarely has before. Though few have mechanical differences that distinguish them from the rest, every nook and cranny is generously littered with chests, collectibles, and amusing Easter eggs that make exploration and looting almost as much fun as the combat . I made frequent use of vehicles to get from one place to another on these large maps, but as with the previous games, vehicular combat is still so clumsy and relatively dull that I only fought in one when a mission required it.  You\u2019ll venture to several varied and beautiful planets, each standing out visually in a way the series rarely has before. \u201c  This time around you and your team of up to four will take control of Moze the Gunner, Zane the Operative, Amara the Siren, or FL4K the Beastmaster . They\u2019re a personable bunch: FL4K\u2019s backhanded compliments are always good for a laugh and Moze\u2019s mid-combat pop-culture references are pulled from refreshingly eclectic sources like Ariana Grande and John Wick. They\u2019re fairly standard fare for a Borderlands game at this point, but unlike the previous games\u2019 casts, every class has their versatility boosted by a choice between three different action skills selectable at the top of each notably beefed-up skill tree \u2013 except for Moze who gets to customize her mech\u2019s loadout. My current Moze skill build is focused on being able to summon my mech for the maximum amount of time on a short cooldown and boosting damage output. That\u2019s helped along by class mods and Anointed item effects that add powerful class-specific bonuses to loot, like an extra charge for FL4K\u2019s Rakk Attack action skill that calls down a fiery pair of flying beasts to dive-bomb enemies.  There are a lot of neat details to sort through when it comes to your class\u2019 progression, like skill augments that evolve FL4K\u2019s pet or give Zane\u2019s drone an airstrike. For my money, though, the most alluring skill point options are the one-and-done passives like Rushin\u2019 Offensive, which allows you to sprint and shoot at the same time, or Dakka Bear, which adds a manable turret to Moze\u2019s mech for co-op play.  Watch the trailer below for a glimpse at some of Borderlands 3's characters:   The cast of supporting characters found in these cosmic backwaters candidly edge out the generic but somewhat amusingly villainous Calypso Twins when it comes to delivering a compelling story. Interacting with Rhys Strongfork (of Tales from the Borderlands fame), Katagawa Jr, and Wainwright Jakobs (the figureheads of the Atlas, Maliwan, and Jakobs megacorporations, respectively) provided interesting insight into the ideological differences between my favorite gun manufacturers. It\u2019s a wonderful marriage of storytelling and gameplay that gives extra depth to the weaponry you collect. Similarly, I love that Borderlands continues to put player characters from the previous games into major roles. Lilith (the original playable Siren) shines in her role as the leader of the Crimson Raiders, but the fact that not everyone is doing as well as she is hits home. For example, visiting the memorial for Roland, who was my very first Vault Hunter back in the day, and finding it littered with heartfelt graffiti certainly struck a sentimental nerve.  The cast of supporting characters candidly edge out the generic but somewhat amusingly villainous Calypso Twins. \u201c  Playing with friends is better than ever thanks to a ping system which can be used on enemies, items, or the environment to quickly clarify who you think should be shooting what or going where even if your teammates don\u2019t have mics. (Thanks, Apex Legends, for making this a mandatory feature in co-op games going forward.) Having a friend to pick you up from a downed state is always nice but the co-op feature that really stands out in 2019 is the ability to share or trade weapons and other gear after you\u2019ve used them, since they don\u2019t bind to your character after being equipped. It\u2019s also notable that your team can choose to play in Cooperation mode, which turns on instanced loot and forgiving level scaling, or Coopetition mode, which disables scaling and lets the fastest player hoover up all the item drops like in the old days. (Also, Borderlands 3 includes matchmaking for various activities but I wasn\u2019t able to test it out before launch.)  Weapons Free  Perhaps Borderlands 3's greatest triumph is that it never felt monotonous over more than 30 hours. I kept waiting for the energetic pace at which new enemies, weapon archetypes, and mission structures were introduced to slow to a grind\u2026 but it never did.  See the companion-using FL4K in action in the gameplay below:   For starters, if your ECHO 3 mission log didn\u2019t clearly label them as such, I would\u2019ve had a hard time distinguishing Borderlands 3\u2019s side missions from its main story missions \u2013 and I absolutely mean that as a compliment. The optional tasks divvied out by the denizens of Pandora and its neighboring planets are creative, enjoyable, and rarely the kind of formulaic, repeatable filler usually associated with optional tasks. There are definitely still some fetch and kill quests, but there\u2019s almost always a twist that makes them feel unique \u2013 and when there\u2019s not, Borderlands 3\u2019s self-deprecating humor makes light of that situation. My absolute favorite side missions were the ones that completely side-stepped convention for quick laugh. For example, Tyreen Calypso offering up a legendary weapon if you simply kill yourself, and the catch this decision comes along with it had me chuckling for hours after the fact.  Even more importantly, I'm every bit as giddy about the purple glint of an epic drop now as I was when I saw my first, and that\u2019s because the incredibly diverse and constantly surprising arsenal absolutely steals the show. Like with its predecessors, Gearbox cooks the books a bit when counting up to the advertised \"one billion guns\u201d in Borderlands 3 by defining nearly mechanically identical weapons with slightly tweaked stats as unique guns. In spite of this fuzzy math, the illusion of infinite firearms is sold much better than ever before thanks to the sheer number of randomized elements with significant and legitimately unique effects, like an otherworldly, organic growth that turns bullets into elemental energy, a rocket-stabilized bipod, or even a barrel that spews radioactive goop.  Even optional missions are creative, enjoyable, and rarely formulaic. \u201c  This meaningful weapon variance is further helped along by a greater emphasis on what differentiates each manufacturer. For instance, all Vladof weapons can switch between two firing modes, like a gatling gun that toggles to an underslung grenade launcher, while Children of the Vault weapons don\u2019t need to be reloaded at all but can overheat and need to cool off if you hold down the trigger too long.  But what's most impressive about Borderlands 3's arsenal is how these weapons looks and feel when you use them. It\u2019s the delightful little touches \u2013 like cocking the hammer on a revolver, the red-hot smoking barrel of a shotgun, or a bolt chattering away on an assault rifle \u2013 that are the types of details I'd expect to see on handcrafted models, not these procedurally assembled ones. In the same vein, many weapons feel fantastic with a mouse and keyboard on PC thanks to pronounced recoil and crisp sound design. My only minor criticism of the gunplay is that the sight picture (the parts of your gun that appear on screen when you raise it to your eye) on many weapons too often obscures your target, somewhat defeating the purpose of including the ability to aim down sights in the first place.  Watch our behind-the-scenes video on how Borderlands 3 makes its guns:   Then comes the creme de la creme of loot: legendaries. Like in Borderlands 2, these guns and gadgets fill out the upper echelon of the loot table with hand-crafted effects that are, in many cases, a celebration of how far Borderlands 3 is willing to go to be absurd and surprising. My favorites so far are the Laser-Sploder that spits out rockets and a laser at the same time, the Cloud Kill (Maya, anyone?) which leaves enemies choking on corrosive fumes, and (through what must be the result of a backroom handshake deal between Texas-based developers) the Hellwalker, which is a dead ringer for the Super Shotgun from Doom.  It should come as no surprise that you\u2019ll be getting plenty of use out of these badass guns thanks to a varied and creative horde of enemies. While the familiar menagerie of foes like bandits, skags, spiderants, and more all return with fresh coats of paint, you\u2019ll also encounter a handful of new archetypes like the monstrous tink-topped hag or a long shot sniper, the latter of which will straight up kill you if you don\u2019t find cover fast enough.   The Honor System Borderlands 3 is not a game-as-a-service like Destiny or The Division 2, which means that all of your data is stored locally. That\u2019s great news for those of us who want to play offline. However, there\u2019s a tradeoff: local storage means its item economy is vulnerable to some easy exploits. If you\u2019re on PC (as I was for this review) you\u2019ll have to exercise restraint to not exploit the obvious item-duplication loopholes that allowed me and a partner in crime to (for science!) duplicate a legendary multiple times. If you want to play legit, it\u2019s best to play with friends who appreciate the merits of doing so. I fully expect that a lot of people will take advantage of these cheats when they see the first signs of a progression grind in the late game \u2013 though if that makes Borderlands 3 more fun for them, more power to them.   Without giving too much away, you\u2019ll also square up against several new enemy types like the futuristic forces of Maliwan and swarms of skittering ratches. Combat encounters with any adversary are enjoyable, even if ratches, varkids, and skags all feel functionally the same. Bandits and Maliwan troops do a great job of keeping you on your toes with increasingly diverse squads thrown at you once you get deeper into the campaign. Things aren\u2019t as consistently excellent, however, when it comes to bosses.  Borderlands 3 is at its most hit-or-miss in the quality of its boss encounters, which, frankly, are all over the place. The bulk of them (especially toward the end of the campaign) are particularly good. There\u2019s the exemplary Agonizer 9000, who comes complete with crit spots, flaming vents to dodge, a massive saw blade to jump over or slide under, and even a second phase which mixes things up further. And the good news is that every other boss with major plot significance follows this great formula: precise telegraphs, challenging mechanics, and mostly avoidable damage.  You can see a match of Borderlands 3's endgame Proving Grounds mode here:   At the opposite end of the spectrum is Killavolt , who covers the entire arena in unavoidable, mostly-lethal electricity that can easily down your entire team at once. Worse, his electricity even zaps the smaller enemies that would otherwise give you a chance at reviving yourself with a Second Wind kill. This was unnecessarily frustrating to the point where I even reached out to Gearbox to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing some mechanic meant to make this fight less of a headache. I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure what the designers were trying to put down here, but I\u2019m definitely not picking it up.  Your adventure doesn\u2019t end when the credits roll. Borderlands 3 has several new ways to play, most notably Mayhem Mode, which incrementally ups the difficulty and adds random effects (like Double Whammy which doubles projectiles fired) to some enemies for greater rewards. After unlocking Mayhem Mode you\u2019ll also start earning all-new Guardian Ranks which provide further stat increases like gun damage and cool effects like increased loot luck after scoring a kill. Couple this with True Vault Hunter (AKA new game plus), the Circle of Slaughter (horde mode by any other name still smells as sweet), and the all-new Proving Grounds (sort of like a non-randomized Diablo 3 rift) and there are many enjoyable ways to skin the endgame cat \u2013 more than we\u2019ve seen in any previous Borderlands game."

        "Content": "Minor equipment spoiler warning! While this review keeps monster and story spoilers to a minimum, the video does show off new weapons and armor from the early-to-mid points of Iceborne's campaign. Keep that in mind if you'd prefer to go in blind!   The line between an expansion and a full-blown sequel is one Monster Hunter World: Iceborne comes close to blurring into oblivion. While this is not an entirely new game in feel or structure when compared to Monster Hunter: World, it adds a new story nearly as large as the base game\u2019s with almost as many new monsters to kill, carve, and wear like a celebratory tuxedo. Couple that with innumerable quality-of-life improvements (plus a few exciting surprises along the way) and Iceborne manages to hit the high bar set by Monster Hunter: World no matter what you call it.  The story this time around is just as amusing and inconsequential as the original: monsters are behaving erratically, a dangerous new elder dragon has appeared, and an exciting snow-covered land unlike any of the others has been discovered. Just like last time, you follow tracks, fight monsters, and try to figure out what\u2019s causing all this commotion so you can promptly kill it and turn it into a sweet pair of pants \u2013 you know, for research.  Every IGN Monster Hunter Review 12 Images  While the story is (once again) pretty much just there to pull you through the bulk of the new content, Iceborne adds a welcome new emphasis on its cast. The excellent cutscene quality you already know is back, but now with more of a spotlight on existing side characters like the Tracker and the Field Team Leader (which does make it a little funny that they still don\u2019t have real names). Without spoilers, these characters have actual story arcs this time \u2013 they\u2019re still pretty shallow, but it made the story more engaging and far less forgettable than the first.  Out With the Old Gear, In With the New  But let\u2019s get into the meat and potatoes of Iceborne: the gear. This expansion picks up after the end of the base game\u2019s main campaign, but I was curious how it would tempt me away from my High Rank armor and weapons, which were full of augments and synergistic skills I\u2019d grown so used to. It turns out the answer is by looking you square in the eye and saying, \u201cThat fancy augmented Gamma armor you like so much? Yeah, it\u2019s trash now.\u201d I\u2019m exaggerating here... but not by much.  Here\u2019s a quick comparison for context: a typical piece of World\u2019s best High Rank armor will give you 72 defense, which can then be bumped up to 92 if you augment and upgrade it to the max. Enter Iceborne\u2019s all-new Master Rank missions with an entirely new tier of equipment where Bone and Alloy Armor \u2013 the bottom-of-the-barrel basic stuff \u2013 has a whopping 114 base defense. Master Rank gear offers a jump in power that truly leaves High Rank in the dust.   And, just so it\u2019s clear, that\u2019s the worst armor in Iceborne. I was able to stubbornly hold onto the High Rank armor I\u2019d worked so hard to get for the first half-dozen quests or so, but when I finally decided to upgrade my total defense jumped more than 300 points in a single trip to the forge. Crucially, while it made me sad to leave my lovely Xeno\u2019Jiiva wings behind, this reset was far more exciting than frustrating. It didn\u2019t really feel like it was devaluing what I had earned in the base game because I was just too dang excited about what I was getting in return. The loot chase is fully reinvigorated.  In addition to the higher stats, new skill combinations to experiment with, and cool new armor aesthetics (most of which are fantastic, though some do look disappointingly identical to their High Rank counterparts), you\u2019re also getting the new level 4 Decoration slots. One of these is on every piece of Beta armor, allowing you to easily use powerful new Decorations that can come with two different skills in one. This helps any Master Rank armor set offer more than just a numerical draw.  The loot chase is fully reinvigorated, offering more than just a numerical draw to convince you to leave your High Rank gear behind. \u201c  Iceborne also clearly wants you to upgrade fast, as early armor can be hilariously cheap to craft. Each piece of the Master Rank Jagras set, for example, only needs one of each of its required materials, acknowledging that you didn\u2019t fly across the ocean to a snowy new land just to immediately go back to the Ancient Forest and hunt Great Jagras all day. It\u2019s a wonderfully self-aware decision, leaving the classic Monster Hunter equipment grind to the more interesting fights.  However, the same level of courtesy isn\u2019t offered to the new weapons. Every weapon tree has been extended, with the previous peak of Rarity 8 now potentially stretching all the way up to the ever-sparkling icons of Rarity 12. It took me longer than I would have liked to get my hands on these cool new toys, as most of the needed materials don\u2019t arrive until much later. Where World stretched eight tiers of rarity over its roughly 40-hour campaign, Iceborne has to stretch just four tiers over a similar length, making weapon progress feel ever so slightly stunted in a way getting new armor doesn\u2019t.   In case you missed it, you can watch our review of the base game above or read it here .  This isn\u2019t helped by the fact that upgrading weapons can sometimes force you to grind old monsters in a way the armor system explicitly avoids. Rarity 9 acts as sort of a new baseline for weapons in Iceborne, and while many of them can be crafted outright to skip the early tiers, a few bafflingly can\u2019t, for seemingly no reason. Just as I didn\u2019t come to Iceborne to fight Great Jagras, Master Rank or not, I especially didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to go back and fight a bunch of Low Rank Legiana or a now trivial Vaal Hazak five times in a row just to get the materials I needed to build up to the new and exciting weapon I actually wanted.  Thankfully this didn\u2019t happen too often, but the inconsistency of some Rarity 9 weapons being craftable on their own and others requiring the previous weapon to upgrade from was aggravating all the same. It was also annoying that some of the new weapons are simple, slightly disappointing recolors of old models. However, the ones that do use unique models were often among the coolest in World so far, like the return of a Rathalos hammer that is literally just the entire dragon\u2019s head on a stick.  A Familiar Menagerie of Monsters  Regardless of what you are turning them into, the new monsters themselves are awesome to fight and look at. As I said, there are nearly as many new monsters in Iceborne as were in the base game at launch, and every single one of them is unique, exciting, and an awesome addition to the lineup. Honestly, there isn\u2019t really a dud amongst them. Some are cooler than others \u2013 like the antlered Banbaro which can pick up a rock with its horns that will change elemental type depending on the location in which you fight it, or the incredible new elder dragon Namielle that has surprises I won\u2019t spoil \u2013 but I loved every single fight I had in this expansion regardless.  New Monsters in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne 27 Images  Monster Hunter has also brought back what are seemingly some of its most vicious creatures from previous games, as these returning enemies probably kicked my butt harder than any of the others. My fight against Nargacuga was the first time I got carted (knocked out) during Iceborne, and those surprising and scary step-ups in power as you continually encounter the \u201cbigger fish\u201d in each ecosystem are alive and well in this expansion.  I want to be clear about how much I enjoyed fighting Iceborne\u2019s monsters, how creative and exciting they are, because I do have one bone to pick \u2013 but it\u2019s a complaint veteran Monster Hunter fans might not have as much of a problem with. It\u2019s that Iceborne relies too heavily on Subspecies and Variants of existing monsters. About half of the roughly two-dozen monsters added in the expansion fall under these categories, essentially acting as reworked remixes of existing ones.  Those surprising and scary step-ups in power as you continually encounter the \u201cbigger fish\u201d in each ecosystem are alive and well. \u201c  That\u2019s not to undersell these fights. A Subspecies like the Coral Pukei-Pukei does more than just color it red, drop it in the Coral Highlands, and replace its poison with water \u2013 it has new special moves, new behaviors, and that change in location can make a tangible difference. These fights are fun ways to turn an encounter I knew like the back of my hand entirely on its head, and I absolutely love that about them.  They really do feel like new fights, but only to a certain extent. Learning to avoid the Nightshade Paolumu\u2019s clouds of sleep-inducing smoke or its new wildly erratic mid-air attack is exciting, but it\u2019s still not as exciting as fighting any of Iceborne\u2019s entirely new monsters - or even the returning ones that are simply new to World. Subspecies are great, but those Paolumu and Pukei-Pukei are still a bit too familiar (especially when the visuals of their armor sets and weapons are often just reskins).   Again, this could be an issue long-time Monster Hunter players won\u2019t care about because their expectations for expansions are different. The series has a long history of filling out its expansions with an influx of Subspecies \u2013 but as one of the roughly nine million players who likely started with World, it was a touch disappointing to see Iceborne\u2019s campaign rely so heavily on familiar faces rather than new ones, no matter how fun they were to fight\u2026 and turn into pants. It is worth noting, however, that more monsters will be added for free post-launch (similar to the base game) with the returning Rajang the first to arrive next month .   How Returning Monsters Stack up in Iceborne  By Casey DeFreitas  Like Generations Ultimate, the most recent expansion in the Monster Hunter series before this, Iceborne brings with it not only these Subspecies and brand new monsters, but plenty of returning favorites, too. Tigrex, Nargacuga, Brachydios, and Glavenus (each of which are flagship monsters of previous installments), plus more have found a new home with Iceborne, and I\u2019m ecstatic to have them all in one place.  As a longtime Monster Hunter fan, I\u2019ve hunted them all to oblivion in previous games, but seeing them reimagined and upgraded in Monster Hunter: World\u2019s gorgeous engine feels like coming home to a long-lost best frenemy. They\u2019re all similar enough to be familiar, but each has slightly new tricks up their sleeves - like better, less predictable AI - that make their fights nearly as engaging as any other new monster.   Sure, I was excited for more entirely new monsters, but these fan-favorites deserved to be recreated. Specifically, Nargacuga - and its theme song, now expertly remade - is one of my personal all-time favorites, and I'm just as happy to fight and farm this guy as I am to fight the all-new Namielle. I also love that returning monsters like Tigrex (my archnemesis from Freedom 2) is nearly as tough as I remember. I say \u201cnearly\u201d not because I feel Tigrex and others have been nerfed, but rather that I have gotten better since I first fought them. But I can't say I don't smile mischievously when my Fifth-Fleet friends complain about Tigrex's erratic attacks in Iceborne!   That all said, I was happy to see that Iceborne introduces subtle changes to old monsters as well. Even if they never feature in the story or get a Subspecies, monsters get more than just more health in Master Rank (though they do get a helluva lot of health too, so fights can last far longer than you may be used to). Some tweaks are as minor as Rathalos now seemingly staying in flight longer and deflecting attacks against its wings more easily, or Jyuratodus deflecting attacks on any body part after you break through its mud covering.  But my favorite changes were ones that more noticeably influenced how a monster behaved, like Tzitzi-Ya-Ku now hopping to change direction in the middle of its signature flash-stun attack \u2013 it\u2019s awesome in the completely infuriating sort of way, but I love that it manages to make that fight a little harder without just bumping up numbers. Master Rank monsters are stronger and more resilient too, but these tweaks made them feel different to fight from the base game\u2019s buffed up Tempered versions.   It\u2019s not an overstatement when I say Iceborne feels like a reset, a new starting point that ratchets everything up and leaves you with little reason to head back to High Rank (unless you are missing some stupid Vaal Hazak fangs, of course). But interestingly, Iceborne doesn\u2019t wait very long at all to start introducing Tempered versions of Master Rank monsters, so you\u2019ll be able to amp things up even further once your gear makes the jump.  A Wider World  While the snowy new location called the Hoarfrost Reach is the focal point of Iceborne, only about half (at most) of the campaign is spent there. You\u2019ll return to the mainland of the New World a fair amount, but there\u2019s actually a great balance struck between exploring this beautiful new playground and facing fresh threats in familiar places. It keeps that winter wonderland from ever getting dull, though it was never at much risk of that to begin with.  While the constant need for Hot Drinks and the slow pace of moving through heavily snowy areas can be tedious at times, the Hoarfrost Reach is a fantastic addition to World. The different sections of its map feel varied and exciting, from icy caverns to hot springs to snowy fields to acid-filled underground lairs. My favorite spot was a frozen cliff face where whole sections of the ground can come crumbling down, dropping you to an underground area far away if you don\u2019t escape to stable footing in time.   Seliana, the new town established just outside of the Hoarfrost Reach, is exciting for a different reason: it\u2019s flat. This is clearly a location that was designed with usability in mind, and its spiderweb of paths makes moving around easy while keeping all of your needed stations (the Resource Center, the Canteen, the Blacksmith, etc.) a mere moment away from each other. Form suffers a little for function here, as the drab white and grey of Seliana make it nowhere near as lovely as the ramshackle ships and colorful foliage of Astera, but it\u2019s so wonderfully convenient that I rarely wanted to go back.  Seliana's flat and close-knit layout is so wonderfully convenient that I rarely wanted to go back to Astera. \u201c  And even if it\u2019s not quite as pretty a picture on the surface, it\u2019s packed with lovely little details all the same. A new chef named the Grammeowster contrasts the Meowscular Chef\u2019s style by cooking with love and delicacy as felynes bake bread and mix stew around her, the new forge is stunning to look at, and the crisscrossing paths and intimate layout of the town give it a much younger feel than the decades-old Astera. Iceborne also continues World\u2019s trend of downright incredible music, as I\u2019ve been whistling Seliana\u2019s lovely theme song for the better part of a month.  Seliana\u2019s Gathering Hub is also a cut above, full of extravagant saunas and pools to sit in and interactable foot baths where you can pet and play with your palico. Unlike Seliana itself, it flaunts style and substance together because it also has access to absolutely everything you might want to check between missions, making its usefulness over the Astera Gathering Hub incomparable. This is suddenly a place where you can easily socialize with groups of friends between missions in a way that\u2019s far more functional than before \u2013 which makes it even better that Iceborne also added a freecam photo mode to mess around with.   Meanwhile, the new personal room in Seliana is about style and nothing else. Placing pets in your Astera rooms is fun, but this is on another level entirely. There are pages of pet spots, all of which can now hold small groups of Endemic Life instead of just one. But more than that, the room itself is customizable to a hysterical degree: floor type, wall type, furniture, curtains, paintings, hanging decorations, items on shelves, plant life, and the color, pattern, or wood grain of many of those things can be changed to your liking. It\u2019s a needlessly elaborate system that affects nothing at all, but that didn\u2019t stop me from spending hours of my time and WAY too many research points buying and customizing this space to my liking.  Tweaks On Tweaks On Tweaks  The quality-of-life improvements don\u2019t stop at Seliana, either. It seems as though a billion tiny changes have been made across the board, including tweaking the UI, how you interact with certain systems, and more. Stuff like not having to return to your room to change your Palico\u2019s equipment, getting a headquarters-specific radial menus to use emotes, and being able to fire your slinger with your weapon drawn. None of it will flip the way you play Monster Hunter on its head, but they\u2019re meaningful enhancements that show Iceborne is intent on doing more than just adding monsters.  One of the most tangible tweaks is an entirely new mechanic that lets you ride small monsters either toward the monster you are hunting, following its tracks, or a location you set on your map. This monster taxi service is leaps and bounds faster than running, and makes the time spent in transit feel useful because it even allows you to use items or sharpen your weapon while riding. It cuts out so much of the tedious in-between of hunting when a monster runs away, especially one you\u2019ve fought a dozen times before. It\u2019s also just cool as hell.   Weapons themselves have also been tweaked in subtle but exciting ways. Every weapon type has received a couple new moves or combos \u2013 ones that don\u2019t completely change how they handle or anything, but add a bit more nuance for experienced users. My main weapon is the Insect Glaive, which has two new mid-air attacks that are fairly basic, but you can now also use slinger ammo to power up your Kinsect. The type of ammo influences the effect, so I found myself thinking just a little bit differently while fighting as a result, adding a touch of freshness to a familiar weapon.  Every weapon type has received a couple new moves or combos that don't change them drastically but can add a touch of freshness to a familiar moveset. \u201c  A bigger change, no matter what weapon you\u2019re using, is the addition of the Clutch Claw. This tool lets you grapple onto a monster and either wound a part, change its direction, or try to drive it into a wall, depending on what you do. Don\u2019t think of this like mounting a monster; it\u2019s a very different and specialized mechanic which lets you grab on, accomplish a task, and retreat. It was relatively confusing to understand how it behaved at first, but my party and I eventually realized just how powerful it is. That realization made me very thankful it doesn\u2019t take up one of your two tool slots.  Wounding a monster part makes it take more damage and be less likely to deflect an attack, which is nearly vital against things like that High Rank Jyuratodus I mentioned earlier, which has had its deflecting capabilities increased by a lot. On the other hand, driving a monster into a wall felt inconsistent at first, but once we realized how reliant this attack is on the state of the monster, it became borderline insane \u2013 it can deal at least 1,000 damage and also knocks the monster down. The Clutch Claw seemed like a neat boondoggle at first, but learning its nuances and mastering it with a group allowed us to better take on the hardest Iceborne had to offer.   And that difficulty is a tricky thing. The main campaign took me about 40 hours to reach the credits, and that was at a somewhat leisurely pace with a bit of grinding mixed in to improve my gear. Everything in it is a good challenge, but it\u2019s also not quite the spike in difficulty veterans may have been hoping for after honing their skills in the base game \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve been taking down tempered monsters for the last year (though I bet even Extreme Behemoth will get a fair bit easier with Master Rank gear). I think it\u2019s good that the main story is still achievable, and of course the credits rolling has never really been the end of a Monster Hunter game by any means...  Avoiding spoilers, Iceborne\u2019s endgame shakes things up in a very unexpected way. You\u2019ll spend your post-credits grind time in a vastly different manner than anything you\u2019ve seen in Monster Hunter: World so far. It\u2019s hard to speak vaguely about it, but what I will say is that it\u2019s an extremely cool direction to go in \u2013 though one which potentially relies more heavily on some of the less exciting parts of grinding for materials than I\u2019d like. Still, it\u2019s a wonderful surprise and more than worth getting to and spending time with after you\u2019ve \u201cbeaten\u201d Iceborne.   PC Release Update  Review update: 1/7/20 \u2014 Iceborne PC release: 1/9/20  While we opted to do a separate review for Monster Hunter: World's initial PC Launch in 2018 as it was the first of the series to reach the platform, World's PC port has more than proven itself since then \u2013 thanks in no small part to many helpful updates along the way. As such, Iceborne is just as extensive and exciting on PC as it is on PS4 or Xbox One.   The only major mark against it is that the PC version of Iceborne is still lagging behind its console counterparts in terms of updates and post-launch content, much of which builds on the already top-notch host of monsters and quality-of-life adjustments Iceborne brought at release. But that content will make its way to PC eventually, and (regrettably) waiting patiently to play with all of those cool new toys will be something veteran PC players like myself are used to already.

        "Content": "PlatinumGames has a reputation for making action games that are both incredibly stylish and delightfully weird. Its latest, the Switch-exclusive Astral Chain, wholeheartedly embraces this tradition and pushes each aspect to the max. This is Platinum at its finest - its innovative combat system cleverly manages to make controlling two characters at once feel intuitive and deeply rewarding. Equally as impressive, the non-combat sequences charmingly bring this peculiar world and the characters who inhabit it to life.  The setup is a fairly typical one: after Earth became uninhabitable due to alien pollution, humanity migrated to the Ark, a futuristic metropolis filled with neon lights and, surprise(!), an alien invasion problem of its own.You know, the usual. You play as one of the two Howard twins - male or female - who is a part of an anti-alien task force that fights using robot allies called Legions. That\u2019s where the eponymous Astral Chain comes in - it\u2019s the tether between you and your Legion and lets you see the aliens, which are called Chimeras.   Though it\u2019s a boilerplate futuristic dystopia at face value, the plot has some fun twists and turns that keep it mostly entertaining throughout. But while many of the characters ooze personality, the Howard twin you play as sadly isn\u2019t one of them. Many games have silent protagonists, but Astral Chain\u2019s quiet hero feels particularly out of place next to the energetic voice actors behind all the other characters, including whichever twin you didn\u2019t pick, who plays an important role in the story. And it\u2019s not like your character doesn\u2019t have a backstory. I would\u2019ve loved to hear the back and forth between the two siblings instead of having to fill in the blanks based on the hero\u2019s generally expressionless looks.  The duo of human and machine conduct a symphony of action awesomeness. \u201c  It\u2019s easy to forget about your Howard\u2019s lack of personality once the combat gets started, though. Together with a Legion, the duo of human and machine conduct a symphony of action awesomeness, complete with a flurry of particle effects and stylized animations. I cannot stress enough how ridiculously cool the combat looks in motion, thanks to bright, cartoonish graphics that look great both docked and on the go. While it performs flawlessly in handheld mode, the fast-moving and flashy animations are easier to appreciate on the big screen at higher resolution.  Fighting alongside your Legion is held together by intuitive controls. Core attacks are mapped to the triggers and bumpers: you can instantly summon your Legion with ZL, then fling it toward a Chimera using the left stick to attack automatically when in range. Howard\u2019s trio of weapons - the Blaster, police baton, and Gladius (heavy sword) - are mapped to ZR. I preferred a combo of police baton and Blaster, though the Gladius packed a serious and satisfying punch against Chimera whose attack patterns I had memorized.  225 Images  Flashy combos can be strung together easily thanks to the simplistic controls. Attacking Chimeras in tandem with your Legion opens up synchronized attack opportunities that flash on screen. These can stack together if you keep the combo going, but only if you execute perfect dodges. Well-timed dodges slow down time for a moment, giving you room to attack the weaker backsides of Chimeras and string together more synchronized attacks. Chimeras attack frequently, both up close and from afar, so much of the combat revolves around dodging, getting your blows in, then dodging some more.  Though Astral Chain lacks a deep combo system, it makes up for that and then some with its roster of Legions. \u201c  Of course, fights would be too easy if you could keep your Legion in play indefinitely, so they each have limiters that count down. If you let that hit zero without manually recalling them then they\u2019ll take even longer to recharge before you can call them back out to help you. The system forces you to be smart, make swift decisions, and keep a watchful eye on the limiter.  The Astral Chain that connects them to you also comes with two cool tricks that complement the combat extraordinarily well. The Chain Jump lets you slingshot across the battlefield toward your Legion, granting you extra mobility around the combat areas. Also, you can also bind Chimeras and hold them in place by encircling them. The former is awesome for dispatching groups of enemies, while the latter is particularly helpful when fighting large bosses who have multiple limbs that you\u2019d rather not have attacking you the whole time.  Though Astral Chain lacks a deep combo system, it makes up for that and then some with its roster of Legions. You gradually unlock five of them, each with their own unique play style and action moves. The Sword can slice through Chimeras and sever their defensive systems. The Arrow, quite naturally, can be used to manually shoot arrows that knock flying Chimeras from the sky. You can take a ride on the Beast\u2019s back and its snout and paws are good for getting Chimeras out from under the ground. You can commandeer the Arm and become a mech with giant fists. And the Axe, which you unlock much later than the others, can conjure a protective dome which comes in handy when up against near-undodgeable attacks.   Each Legion also has its own skill tree and ability slots for stat and item buffs. It\u2019s a bit of a bummer that most skills are the same across all five Legions, but there are some unique and worthwhile abilities hidden in there. My favorite is the Arm\u2019s Round Bullet, which commands it to spin like a top while shooting blasts in every direction. Overall, the Beast is my Legion of choice, partly because riding the giant dog is a great way to get around, but also because I love how it uses its paws of fury to viciously claw at Chimera.  I love how the Beast Legion uses its paws of fury to viciously claw at Chimera. \u201c  Throughout the 11 lengthy missions Chimeras come in all shapes and sizes, from standard shielded baddies to large four-legged beasts to annoying dudes with huge wings, serpents, and more. Sometimes you have to fight corrupted humans, but thankfully you don\u2019t have to wade through wave upon wave of these mindless grunts. Each mission also has at least a couple of boss Chimeras, some of whom are so large you can only see half of their body on screen while fighting them. They are sometimes reconfigurations of previous boss fights, but most add something new to the mix so they\u2019re not straight repeats.  No stylish action game is complete with a rankings system, and in Astral Chain you\u2019re graded for each \u201ccase\u201d you complete in a mission, as well as given an overall grade at the end. I\u2019ve already gone back to try to raise my grade in several missions by maximizing style and speed and minimizing damage taken.  In a welcome move, Platinum included difficulty options for both aficionados and action newcomers alike. After finishing a mission on Platinum Standard you can try your hand at the harder Platinum Ultimate, which eliminates revives (called batteries) and ups the intensity. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Unchained mode, a customizable difficulty level that lets you toggle 15 different settings to fit your needs. You can go as far as automating combat entirely if you just want to watch the story. The wealth of options reminded me of Celeste\u2019s great Assist mode.   Co-op Drop The weirdest and most difficult way to play Astral Chain is in couch co-op, which has players use a single Joy-Con each as one controls Howard and the other plays as the Legion. Co-op could have been a nice inclusion, but I found coordinating with a partner to be more of a headache than it was worth. Being forced to use one Joy-Con - Pro Controller and paired Joy-Con support in co-op is bafflingly absent - for an action game didn\u2019t help either, as one player controls movement and the other controls the camera. You can imagine how frustrating this can get if you aren\u2019t completely in sync with your partner. It\u2019s just awkward and takes away the most novel aspect of the combat: learning to control two characters yourself.   Beyond shooting for higher ranks, there are tangible reasons to replay missions, too. The Ark isn\u2019t an open world, but each mission takes place in a large level with numerous optional areas. Sure, you can move through linearly, only speaking to people you need to in order to advance the story, but if you take the time to explore with the all-knowing scanning technology IRIS (which is downright Orwellian) you\u2019ll quickly discover hidden alleyways with side quests, optional combat scenarios, and areas that are inaccessible without the help of a specific Legion. In fact, simply completing the mainline activities in a mission usually amounts to about half the content that\u2019s actually in there. And the optional stuff doesn\u2019t feel like filler - it rounds out the world.  You can find hidden side quests and combat scenarios by taking the time to explore, and that optional stuff doesn\u2019t feel like filler. \u201c  Sure, some of it is menial tasks, like helping a man find a burger joint or getting a kid\u2019s balloon out of a tree, but they\u2019re oddly charming. It was hilarious to me that a special agent tasked with saving the world would also take the time to help citizens with arguably non-problems amidst a terrifying alien invasion, but this is hardly the first video game to be ridiculous in that particular way.  Even the Neuron Headquarters, the starting and ending point for most missions, is interesting to explore. Here you can buy medicinal items, visit the training room to learn new moves, change cosmetic-only clothing items in the locker room, buy stat buff concoctions from the talking vending machine, upgrade your weapons and Legions, and talk to the other agents who almost always have something interesting to add. The Ark is a strange place and, without spoiling anything, I can say it gets much stranger if you ask around. Despite being framed as a fight to save humanity, Astral Chain still often feels lighthearted. The HQ tour is given by a woman who dresses as a dog mascot named Lappy. She takes it very seriously, and I respect that.  In what was a thorough surprise to me, I wound up enjoying the non-combat portions of missions almost as much as the stellar fights. Exploration can take up about half of the campaign\u2019s runtime depending on how diligently you look around, and it never felt like a waste to do so.   A number of missions start with investigations. Using the IRIS and your social skills, you have to search for clues to advance the story. Sometimes people will just give you the info you need; other times you have to work for it by running errands, catching bad guys, corralling lost cats, solving riddles, eavesdropping, and more. All of this provides a nice break from the action with quirky and fun dialogue, so I always went out of my way to talk to as many people as I could. At the end of the investigation a teammate asks you what you learned, and if you paid attention to the clues, you can get a good ranking for the sequence. You\u2019ll still move on with wrong answers, but I have to say I very much cared about getting the answers right - the wrong answer sound hurt my soul.  On top of that, Astral Chain\u2019s light puzzles and platforming further break up the action. Most of these, like the combat sequences, are found in the hellish Astral Plane you enter through rift gates. While this dreary world of darkness harbors many of the most dangerous Chimeras, it also houses some non-combat challenges for you and your Legions: Shooting arrows to reveal hidden passageways, hopping across platforms through chain leaps, or galloping across gradually disappearing ground on the back of the Beast Legion. None of these sequences are particularly challenging, but they do add to the variety and gave me time to really appreciate my surroundings."

        "Content": "After a generation jam-packed with realistic racers that have made it their mission to teach us to drive clean and race fair, Wreckfest arrives like a sharp but needed kick in the shins. Forget driving etiquette; this is the automotive equivalent of a bar brawl, and it\u2019s absolutely outstanding. Assembled by Finnish destruction racing specialists Bugbear, Wreckfest rekindles the door-slamming spirit of their original FlatOut games and brings it back to life inside the best demolition derby game in over a decade. Don\u2019t be deceived by Wreckfest\u2019s overt focus on wildly exaggerated, metal-rending mayhem. This isn\u2019t a strictly arcade smash-\u2019em-up carved from the Burnout block; it\u2019s a true successor to the likes of Destruction Derby, the original FlatOut, and the criminally underrated Test Drive: Eve of Destruction (known as Driven to Destruction to those of us outside North America). There\u2019s actually a serious driving model beneath all of this over-the-top, elbows-out competition and conquering the cars here requires more than hope and a heavy right foot \u2013 you need some genuine skill. A fairly typical array of driving aids is on hand to tone it down a little, but I reckon Wreckfest is at its best when most of them are stripped away and we have to work harder behind the wheel. Hulking American muscle cars and land yachts squat back on their worn springs and need to be wrestled into heroic Hollywood powerslides and steered on the throttle. Smaller European and Japanese models are nimbler but they\u2019re also lighter, and some are prone to pitching themselves into lethal tankslappers. Some of the cars feel quite similar to each other but overall there are notable differences between the range of body types, from muscle to family wagons, and from sports coupes to front-wheel drive hatchbacks. Live to race, race what you live in. The special vehicles are another story altogether, from the top-heavy double-decker cars and rollover-prone schoolbuses to the huge harvester with its distinctive rear-wheel steering. The RV is probably my favourite as, despite its heft and relatively low power, it just loves being whipped sideways into ludicrous drifts. There\u2019s also a motorised couch, which handles a lot better than I\u2019d expected it would (but probably could\u2019ve done with some wheelie bars). There are significant differences in grip from mud or gravel to tarmac but, with Wreckfest\u2019s well-tuned sense of weight and friction, the handling overall is smashing. It seems just about every panel and part can be punished, pulverised, or just prised off completely. \u201c Equally smashing, of course, is the actual smashing, whether you\u2019re careening through trackside objects or mercilessly poleaxing your opposition. Wreckfest\u2019s wonderful soft-body dynamics mean the cars can be bruised, battered, and bent beyond recognition. The level of damage goes well clear of most other driving games; certainly most everything this side of the realistic car-crashing sim Beam.NG Drive, which uses similar soft-body tech. It seems just about every panel and part can be punished, pulverised, or simply prised off completely. Wreckfest actually has two damage levels you can pick from: normal and realistic. Normal, which makes cars tough but not invincible, is more fun because you can take a few hits and keep going \u2013 but I do enjoy the challenge of playing with realistic damage, where just one mistake can see you limping to the finish line missing a wheel. It\u2019s compulsively addictive. That's not gone well, then. Debris from collisions is persistent, too, and every new lap lays down more evidence of the high-speed war playing out on track. By the end of a race it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be wading through a carpet of metal shards, splintered wood, scattered tyres, and shattered concrete. The sheer amount of mess left in the aftermath of races is wild, and yet almost never affects frame rate. I\u2019ve had some bad slowdown on Xbox fighting through a full field of tightly-packed RVs tearing each other to bits but, other than that, it\u2019s been extremely stable. The AI deserves a special mention as well for giving as good as it takes, and they\u2019re tough but fallible foes. They ruined my races occasionally \u2013 but remember, that\u2019s the point. Getting dive-bombed, T-boned, and unloaded in the middle of a drift is all part of the experience and forces us to race defensively and take different lines through corners. Just remember: there\u2019s no penalty for doing the same thing back to them, so have at it. There\u2019s a level of authenticity to the ovals, dirt tracks, and rallycross circuits here that really suits Wreckfest\u2019s tone as a serious destruction derby game at heart. \u201c Despite my love for the cult favourite FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, I\u2019m happy Bugbear has opted for a more sanctioned, grassroots motorsport feel here in Wreckfest. There\u2019s a level of authenticity to the ovals, dirt tracks, and rallycross circuits here that really suits Wreckfest\u2019s tone as a serious destruction derby game at heart. There\u2019s still plenty of wild stuff, though \u2013 like an insanely dangerous loop-the-loop track, deadly figure-8s, courses that double back on themselves, and derby bowls that are basically skate parks for cars. This outrageous loop is some of the best fun in the game. That credibility extends to the cars, too, which are some of the coolest vehicles I\u2019ve seen in a racing game. Each has been meticulously detailed to look like a hand-painted, hastily-welded rust bucket and \u2013 while they\u2019re not licensed \u2013 gearheads are sure to recognise a classic Volvo 240 Estate, a Honda CR-X, or a MkI Escort when they see them. They all sound as cool as they look, too, from the grumble of a 50-year-old V8 to the buzz of an angry inline-four. There are a ton of great visual customisation options and liveries available, though Wreckfest is definitely screaming for some kind of rudimentary paint editor where we can spray on our own numbers and messages. Performance tuning is included, too, but it\u2019s a bit disappointing Bugbear opted to ape the Forza and Need for Speed approach with clean and sterile upgrade menus that are in conflict with the grungy junkyard spirit we\u2019re bathed in everywhere else. It\u2019s also a bit annoying that you can\u2019t save and quickly apply different set-ups for cars \u2013 like an armoured-up battle-ready beast for derby events and a stripped-down speedster for race events. There\u2019s no cost to reapply owned upgrades but it\u2019s a bit of unnecessary dicking about. There are plenty of premade events in Wreckfest but, while Bugbear has been patient in rationing out its tracks throughout the five tiers of career races, the event types do get a little repetitive. Online multiplayer is on hand to stretch out that lifespan, but I expect I\u2019ll get more value out of the event editor. See if you can last 20 laps against two dozen buses on a lawnmower!"

        "Content": "It would be obvious to refer to Observation as \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey: The Game\u201d. In fact, that's how developer No Code has described it itself. But in truth, this sci-fi thriller melds so much more than that together: Alien\u2019s constant sense of dread and labyrinth of claustrophobic corridors; Solaris\u2019 emotional core and haunting ethereality; and Interstellar\u2019s sheer desperation and explosive moments. All of these combine to create a gripping story that\u2019s threaded around a series of cleverly designed puzzles to create a truly unique gaming experience. Observation casts you as SAM (Systems Administration and Maintenance), the omnipresent AI of the titular space station. First impressions suggest that the station is abandoned apart from its lone occupant, Dr. Emma Fisher. It quickly becomes apparent something extraterrestrial has been at work, and figuring out what has happened is your first step. It\u2019s a captivating setup, as you endeavour to find out how your mission has taken a turn for the worse. Almost every meaningful interaction comes through the UI. Doors aren\u2019t unlocked by hand, but in system menus. Extractor fans aren\u2019t flicked on at a switch, but operated by creating a system link from a nearby camera. This is perhaps unsurprising as Jon McKellan, Observation\u2019s director, was the chief UI designer for Alien: Isolation, but those concepts have been expanded upon here, with slick text displays where many of the objectives are tackled. Almost every meaningful interaction comes through the UI. \u201c The method for solving each puzzle is provided as a scanned document or analysed schematics obtained while exploring the environment. It\u2019s then up to you to work out the specific solution to the task, using everything you\u2019ve learned while steadily drip-feeding new ideas into your memory, in many ways mimicking how an AI learns over time. It\u2019s a storytelling mechanic, too: as you find new technical information around the space station, gaps in SAM\u2019s memory core start to fill. While the plot is intriguing, and drives Observation along on at a good pace, there\u2019s plenty of calm amid the chaos. You are encouraged to explore each of the station\u2019s former inhabitants\u2019 living spaces to find out more about them and their lives, leading to quiet moments of smaller scale drama. Imagine being able to hit the pause button on the Nostromo and comb through Kane\u2019s diary \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of backstory insight you get from these documents and voice recordings. All of these intertwining personal stories and relationships layer on top of each other to help build atmosphere, which is something Observation offers in abundance.  No Code\u2019s previous outing, Stories Untold is rooted in atmosphere and Observation is no different, stepping things up in the visual department to aid that feeling. The snaking corridors are dressed in glistening metal and glossy plastics. Designs and blueprints of the ISS (International Space Station) currently orbiting our Earth have been pored over in the creation of the Observation, and it really shows. The level of detail is astounding, managing to balance the hard-edged, clinical nature of the vessel with lived-in human touches. Clothing and equipment float against the pearly white walls that mirror the central clash of man versus machine. The level of detail is astounding, managing to balance the hard-edged, clinical nature of the vessel with lived-in human touches. \u201c The sound design is exquisite. The clanging of distant metal and perpetual hum of machinery is punctuated with stabbing moments of bruising, electronic cacophony. The title credits are soundtracked by a superb pulsating score composed by Nine Inch Nail\u2019s Robin Finck. The cast of characters are voiced solidly as a whole, but the leads are truly the standouts. Kezia Burrows\u2019 believable and emotive performance as Emma Fisher contrasts beautifully with the voice of SAM - Anthony Howell\u2019s performance is deeply (and purposefully) reminiscent of 2001\u2019s H.A.L - and I found myself triggering extra voice lines just to hear interactions between them. One area of presentation that doesn\u2019t quite stand up to the standard of fidelity Observation sets elsewhere is the human character modelling. Lip syncing isn\u2019t quite up to scratch and looking into Dr. Fisher\u2019s eyes occasionally feels like staring into a black hole. It\u2019s a shame the fear and desperation so often conveyed in her dialogue are rarely, if ever, displayed on her face. Similarly, characters can look stiff moving through the environment, clashing with the polished look of the station\u2019s interior design. Thankfully, it\u2019s an issue that doesn\u2019t occur too often - you interact far more with the station\u2019s systems than the human life that occupies the spaces in between. There are a variety of observation tools at your disposal, from dozens of CCTV-like cameras placed around each of the station\u2019s many modules to the more liberating drone spheres SAM can possess. These enable you to explore more freely, even outside of the ship, and to float around its expansive exterior. The space station is an overwhelming beast at first, especially when it first opens up after the tutorial, but it soon becomes familiar and I found I wasn\u2019t relying on the map as much as I progressed through the six-hour campaign. However, there were times when found myself getting a little disoriented, especially when probing around the outside of the vessel, where no map is available. An early moment took me far longer than it probably should as I spun myself in the wrong direction and lost my bearings while trying find a damaged part of the station. Think of it more like building a piece of furniture as opposed to completing a crossword. \u201c While the scope of infinite space provides its backdrop, the focus of Observation\u2019s puzzles is relatively small in scale, but they are nevertheless engaging. It brilliantly succeeds at morphing what could easily be dull, scientifically grounded tasks into cerebrally pleasing puzzles. These range from testing your memory when attempting communication to racing against the clock to input all of the correct commands when dealing with a fire. Although few present much of a challenge, they\u2019re undoubtedly effective at making you feel a participant in the story as opposed to an onlooker. Think of it more like building a piece of furniture as opposed to completing a crossword. But what\u2019s clever about Observation is the thought process for even a simple task is more complex than you\u2019ll find in most games. Take operating a hatch. As SAM, you must first find a laptop before creating a connection to it. Next, you must obtain the hatch schematic for that specific part of the station before interacting with the hatch controls. This isn\u2019t straightforward either - each action you\u2019re able to perform has a corresponding pattern, which you must input on a 10x10 grid to execute. It\u2019s drawn out but consistently captivating, transforming what could otherwise be a simple gameplay process into something more involved. Observation Screenshots 8 Images You\u2019re encouraged to explore SAM\u2019s OS and become familiar with how to tackle each of these simple problems, and I found myself becoming more efficient each time I encountered one. A minor gripe is the complexity of puzzles never really scaled with the heightened stakes of the story as it progressed towards its conclusion. I never really got stuck on a problem for any length of time, and it\u2019s a little underwhelming to find yourself doing puzzles at the end that are so similar to what you did at the start. This isn\u2019t necessarily to the detriment of Observation overall, though, as it\u2019s the compelling storytelling that ultimately shines through. So many high-concept science-fiction stories stumble trying to provide a satisfying ending to an ever-changing plot. While some thought Stories Untold, suffered from a rather heavy-handed conclusion, Observation\u2019s finale is elegant. The last 20 minutes bring together everything you\u2019ve seen and learned in an emotionally grounded, visually spectacular denouement."

There\u2019s a lot to do even now in early access, like chase down game-changing unlocks and Easter eggs across the continuity of multiple runs, even if there are a few rough edges like online stability. I\u2019m enamored with what\u2019s already here, and am left eagerly awaiting what comes next for one my favorite co-op surprises this year.  Risk of Rain 2\u2019s basic formula is straightforward and instantly gratifying: you and a team of up to three others crash onto the surface of a planet\u2019s pleasantly stylized environment and fight your way through an unending onslaught of ever-more-challenging enemies to earn loot. Some of the rarest items, like the Brilliant Behemoth that adds an explosion to every attack, provide transformative effects that can take a build from great to straight-up-busted, in the most satisfying way. And, since there\u2019s no limit on how many of a given item you can collect, the absurdity of what you\u2019re able to luck into is both ridiculous and supremely fun.   At one point I found a sequencing shrine that turned my horde of gear into large stacks of three separate items that gave me 100% critical strike chance, 20-some-odd extra jumps, and a hail of spectral daggers flying in every which direction. While items provide a passive effect, you can equip a single piece of equipment that confers an activated ability, like the power to spawn a black hole. The result of all this upgrading is that synergies within your build tend to emerge, especially when you factor in the six currently playable classes called \u201csurvivors.\u201d  Surviving the Storm Each of the six survivors present a uniquely enjoyable playstyle thanks to a handful of exclusive skills. The Huntress\u2019s Laser Glaive bounces between targets, dealing increased damage with each blow, MUL-T\u2019s retool switches between two separate sets of weapons and equipment, and the Engineer\u2019s turret can wear sunglasses. Five of the six survivors must be unlocked by completing challenges, which provided a fun carrot to chase across multiple playthroughs that was easy to keep track of via the logbook. You\u2019ll be attacked by everything from suicidal exploding jellyfish to lumbering Stone Golems that fire off a devastating but easy-to-dodge laser from afar, and the resulting variety keeps combat engaging as the threat ramps up. Distinct silhouettes and audio cues make it easy to react to an impending threat at a moment\u2019s notice. Boss fights, too, are well-telegraphed to feel fair. and their impressive size and spectacle evoke a feeling of challenge. Distinct silhouettes and audio cues make it easy to react to an impending threat at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201c  The increasing difficulty is constant, but the rate at which you advance to the next environment is up to you, and that\u2019s a good thing since some unlocks require you to beat a certain number of levels at a hurried pace. At some point, I\u2019d like to see an option for a definitive end-of-run challenge to cap it off. Currently, there are a few handcrafted battles found in mysterious portals and hidden passageways. These boss fights are fantastic, requiring a well-developed build and a well-executed strategy. There are plenty of other Easter eggs too, like a mysterious security chest at Rally Point Delta that will reward you handsomely for your effort. I\u2019d love to see more of these cryptic and challenging elements added to Risk of Rain 2.   Home Improvements  Killing enemies lines your pockets with gold needed to gear up via chests and containers, but that\u2019s not the only way to progress. There are plenty of interactables that provide a fun risk/reward dynamic. The challenge of the mountain, for instance, doubles or even triples the number of bosses for proportionally multiplied rewards. As a result, I felt in control of how much gear I acquired during any given run, just not what I was getting. The randomization of loot undoubtedly plays a big part in giving Risk of Rain 2\u2019s its tremendous replayability, but at times it felt like a flat-out hindrance because I simply couldn\u2019t seem to find crucial common items that were usually abundant. There are a few choices to be made where you can spend rare Lunar Currency that persists across playthroughs. But for the most part, you\u2019re at the mercy of the lady luck when it comes to progression. Risk of Rain 2 is best played in a private lobby with friends from both a gameplay and connectivity standpoint. \u201c There are an abundance of \u201cunder construction\u201d icons found in the logbook, but other than that Risk of Rain 2\u2019s early access state only really seems to matter where matchmaking is concerned. More than half of my dozens of attempts to use quickplay to match with strangers ended in disaster. Lobbies failed to start, latency was sometimes unbearably high, and disconnects were common. These faults are compounded by the lack of common multiplayer amenities like a ping display, host migration, or reconnect functionally. The good news is that Risk of Rain 2 is best played in a private lobby with friends from both a gameplay and connectivity standpoint, here my experiences were much smoother."

Read more on IGN's re-review policy .] Apex Legends is something of a zeitgeist stew, checking all of the boxes of recent trends all the way down to its grandiose but nondescript title. It\u2019s one part by-the-numbers battle royale, complete with the descent from the sky, emphasis on scavenging for loot, and shrinking playable area. It\u2019s another part hero shooter, featuring eight characters called Legends with unique ability sets built for steadfast teamwork. It comes decked out with all the modern free-to-play, games-as-service fixings, including weapon skins, emotes, seasons stretching throughout the rest of the year and (hopefully) years to come, and even the much-maligned loot boxes. None of those borrowed ideas scream originality on their own, but here they come together as something totally new thanks to a roster of personable Legends, a single lavishly designed map, and a smart approach to its mandatory three-person squads. Add great gunplay, a groundbreaking communication system, and a degree of polish that\u2019s all but unheard of in this genre, and Apex Legends has burst onto the scene as one of the most refined and entertaining battle royale games I\u2019ve played. Set in the Titanfall universe (but conspicuously lacking the signature Titans, falling or otherwise,) a match of Apex Legends is relatively small scale: 20 teams of three compete in a last-team-standing competition on a gradually shrinking, sci-fi-infused map. At first, I was worried about the mandatory squad-based setup, given my less-than-great experiences playing with randoms in other battle royale games. So far, however, I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised, in large part because of excellent non-verbal communication. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game!

With the tap of a button you can call out points of interest, whether that be supplies, enemy locations, or just a spot you think the team should go towards, and your character will verbally acknowledge the pings by intelligently translating what you wanted to say to your team. It\u2019ll even offer up other bits of dialogue automatically, such as when shots are fired. I\u2019m genuinely amazed at how advanced this incredibly simple-to-use system feels. I\u2019ve marked unassuming enemies closing in on our location and watched as my teammates converged on their location from different angles, flanking them without so much as a single word spoken. Likewise, while your search for loot may be turning up nothing but measly pistols and loads of attachments you can\u2019t use, one of your teammates might find and mark a useful SMG for you to grab. The vast majority of players are effectively using the ping system to coordinate.In my 20-or-so hours of playing on PS4 over the past week, I\u2019ve found that the vast majority of players are effectively using the ping system to coordinate with their teammates rather than going off on their own. It\u2019s a revelation for those of us who thus far haven\u2019t particularly cared for playing with randoms online, regardless of whether they have a mic or not. It\u2019s great that the ping system exists because cohesive teamwork really is the only way to make it to the end of a match. That\u2019s in part due to the fact that Apex Legends is unique among battle royale games thus far in that it\u2019s possible to revive a teammate even after they\u2019ve bled out and completely died. (It turns out they\u2019re only mostly dead.) A teammate can grab your banner within 90 seconds of your death and make the trek to the nearest beacon, which brings you back from the dead via a spectacular dropship landing that is sure to draw the attention of every squad in the area. The multi-step process \u2013 during all of which you\u2019re leaving yourself vulnerable \u2013 means you have to deal with nearby threats quickly if you want to resurrect someone, because it\u2019s effectively impossible to do while being shot at. That only further places the focus on solid teamwork. A handful of my deaths have come from making ill-advised attempts at securing a banner before the timer runs out. But the risk that comes with the reward of keeping your squad full, in my experience, has always been worth it. Near the end of the match at least a few teams are typically fully intact and strapped with all of the best loot grabbed from fallen players; in these confined, high-stakes moments, being short even one teammate is hard to overcome. Each of my several victories have been won with all three of us still alive. Surprisingly, this respawn system is implemented in such a way that it doesn\u2019t really drag out the match length, so even matches where I made it to the end have taken around 20 to 25 minutes. The varied Legends you choose from add new wrinkles to the battle royale format and further place the focus on playing as a team. The eight options (two of whom are initially locked behind a grind-or-pay wall) each have their own neat tactical, passive, and chargeable ultimate abilities that can come in handy at times. That said, because firepower is determined by the guns you find rather than the class you pick, they don\u2019t feel as absolutely necessary as the class interplay of something like Overwatch, where a support character will get smoked by a DPS; in Apex Legends, the abilities feel more like perks than full-blown, restrictive identities, so you can play as anybody you like and your team will likely be viable. This has encouraged me to try different characters without worrying much about team balance. Mostly, I\u2019m finding the Legends to be a fun addition because of their voice acting, all of which is upbeat. I\u2019ve latched onto Bangalore , a DPS Legend, and Gibraltar , a defensive Legend, largely because of their ultimate abilities, which happen to be quite similar. Bangalore can call in a sweeping artillery strike and Gibraltar has a more confined mortar strike, both of which I\u2019ve used to successfully take down entire teams who carelessly bunched up. Other Legends have cool and useful situational abilities: Wraith can create a void to teleport to safety, the Pathfinder is a robot with a grappling hook for quick movement, and Bloodhound has a tactical ability that can show enemy locations and footprints. Lifeline is a traditional healer with a passive ability that lets you revive teammates quicker behind the safety of a shield, and her tactical move deploys a tiny drone that heals nearby players. With her ultimate fully charged, you can call in a supply drop filled with solid defensive gear. Legend abilities can save your squad or get you out of a tricky situation.Occasionally, the Legend abilities can save your squad or get you out of a tricky situation, but like other battle royale games, Apex Legends is all about the loot. As has become standard, it\u2019s scattered everywhere with supply ships periodically dropping high-tier gear you can risk going after if you think no one\u2019s watching. Supply bins and buildings are also littered with helmets, body armor, ammo, grenades, health kits, and shield boosts. One of the loot features I like most is that it doesn\u2019t let you pick up worse gear than what you already have, saving you precious backpack space (ammo, on the other hand, does take up inventory space). Like both Titanfall games, Apex Legends\u2019 gunplay is impactful and precise. The guns themselves are fairly standard fare: SMGs, shotguns, LMGs, assault rifles, pistols, and sniper rifles, but each gun has a satisfying kick and sound when it fires, and they all have a distinct weightiness which makes them feel unique to use. Numerical damage points pop off of enemies when you hit them, and these are cleverly color-coded to inform you the type of armor \u2013 if any \u2013 the enemy currently has on. Guns can be modified with scopes, extended magazines, and barrel stabilizers, but the most noticeable modifications are hop-ups like the Precision Choke for the Peacekeeper and Triple Take, which decreases pellet spread while aiming down sight and adds a fun particle animation along the way. From a gameplay standpoint, the Peacekeeper, in particular, feels like an entirely different weapon with the mod attached and I\u2019d love to see more impactful hop-ups like this added in the future. The absence of the wondrous wall-running and Titans makes Apex Legends a different experience for sure, but it feels amazing to run into a slide down a hill, look down your sight, and pick off an opposing player in the distance. The ability to climb over walls and ledges gives you a touch of Titanfall\u2019s vertical mobility, at least. Wow: King's Canyon is already easily my favorite battle royale map.Apex Legends currently has just one map, called Kings Canyon , but wow: it\u2019s already easily my favorite battle royale map. The layout is absolutely bonkers, in the best way: it has rushing waterfalls, elaborate multi-floor military complexes, commercial areas, grassy jungles, sandy wastelands, and settlements stretching across ruined embankments. I saw giant Tauntaun-like creatures swaying in the distance, and walked through a rib cage of a massive creature in an area that reminded me of Halo 2\u2019s Burial Mounds map. None of it really makes sense as a real place, of course, but it\u2019s a lot of fun to move and fight across. One of the smartest things Apex Legends does with its map solves one of my major gripes with most battle royale games. Since the playable area shrinks every few minutes, some of the coolest features of the maps are only in play for short spurts. Or worse: some maps have a ton of wasted, boring space. But here, I haven\u2019t run into anything like that in the dozens of matches I\u2019ve played so far. All areas of the map are rich with detail and interesting to explore, and full of things like horizontal and vertical ziplines to get around quickly. (Some are attached to balloons and effectively relaunch you into the sky to redeploy to a different area of the map.) Even when you don\u2019t see an opposing team for the first five minutes or so \u2013 and this has happened to me several times \u2013 the map provides thrills of its own. One minute you\u2019re running through an underground tunnel and the next minute you\u2019re scaling a cliff that reveals a massive building filled with high-tier loot. That might diminish over time as we learn the ins and outs of this new, barely explored map, but I\u2019m enjoying the discovery more than usual. Despite the smaller player count per match, I\u2019m finding more often than not that about half the teams are eliminated during round one \u2013 before the ring shrinks for the first time. Some of these early skirmishes can be attributed to dropping in popular areas such as the Hot Zone (a special high-tier loot area), but other times it seems to be the luck of the draw. You never really know what you\u2019re going to find in a building. If a nearby team is fully stocked and your team is still looking for something better than a pistol, well, it\u2019s open season on your squad. Every battle royale game so far has unfortunate early moments where you feel like you simply got unlucky. I consider that to be part of the genre\u2019s charm, and it\u2019s still present here. Once you make it to round two and beyond, however, happenstance is replaced by a game of skill. The late game, when the ring is as small as one named area and only a few teams remain, is simply riveting. It\u2019s where your team communication skills are most important and where Legend abilities can sway the tides of victory in your favor. Besides the two character unlocks, Apex Legends follows the microtransaction models of games like Fortnite and Overwatch, which depend on a level playing field for every combatant and reserves out-of-match purchases for Apex packs (loot boxes) containing cosmetics, such as skins and emotes. While you\u2019re not entirely dependent on the exact item you want popping out of the box, obtaining a specific skin is somewhat of a convoluted process. First, you have to earn or buy a loot box and hope that crafting metal is one of the three items. Once you have enough crafting metal , you can use it to buy the specific skin of your choice. But opening loot boxes is unavoidable, though you only earn one pack each time you level up. Thankfully, if you do spend money you\u2019ll never get a duplicate item. The process for unlocking the two characters, however, is somewhat laborious without spending money. It took me around 15 hours to earn enough to unlock one of the two characters. Buying both Legends with real money will set you back $20 (with five bucks\u2019 worth of currency left over for cosmetics). That said, from my experience, the two locked characters aren\u2019t better than the six you have from the start, so there\u2019s no pay-to-win scheme going on here at launch. They don\u2019t give you a competitive advantage \u2013 just a different way to play \u2013 but their availability gives you something to work towards or pay for upfront, if you so choose. That said, Respawn plans to add new Legends, cosmetics, and loot every few months, which could result in a setup like League of Legends and Smite. That\u2019s not as generous as some fully free-to-play games like Dota 2, but it\u2019s definitely a proven model."

Humble Bundle and IGN operate completely independently, and no special consideration is given to Humble Bundle-published or financed games for coverage or scoring.] Slay the Spire is one of those games where I found myself sitting alone at my desk just giggling as I played. Not because it\u2019s exceptionally funny \u2013 though its well-written encounters can be that \u2013 but because some combo of cards that had chanced its way into my hand would just go off, and the result was an absolute thrill. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh because, win or lose, that combo may never show up again. But boy, was it a blast in the moment. Here\u2019s a genre mix you probably haven\u2019t seen before: Slay the Spire is a deckbuilding roguelike dungeon crawler. Don\u2019t mistake it for a deckbuilding game like Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering ; instead, you pick one of three varied but equally exciting characters with unique card pools and start with a super basic deck. As you work your way up the Spire, you\u2019ll fight increasingly difficult monsters to acquire a randomized selection of new cards that slowly build your deck into something better. Being a roguelike,  a run in which you make it all the way to the top only takes about an hour, giving Slay the Spire an addictive loop of picking cards, figuring out how good they are, dying frequently, and then taking that hard-earned knowledge with you into the next run. Apart from unlocking a few new cards and collectible Relics as you play, you never actually get stronger from one run to another. You just get smarter and better at quickly deciding what will or won\u2019t be useful, and the experimentation is one of my favorite parts. Slay the Spire has an addictive loop of experimenting, dying, and growing for the next run. It can be as simple as when you choose to play an attack card or a defense card. Knowing when you can afford to take a few points of damage to inflict a few more of your own isn\u2019t a huge deal in the heat of a battle, but it can make the difference in the long run as the Spire wears you down. Those little decisions are deceptively important, and there\u2019s rarely an objectively \u201cright\u201d choice, which leaves lots of room to find your personal play style. Slay the Spire doesn\u2019t rush you with a timer as you make those tough calls either, so my confidence actually grew from every failed run since. Taking as much pressure-free time as I needed was helpful early on, and pulling up the deck or discard screens even conveniently pauses the action during your opponent's turn. But the simple animations for playing cards are still satisfyingly snappy, and I could take some turns lightning-fast once I got more comfortable. Pick Your Poison While the available characters roughly conform to some general RPG archetype \u2013 the Ironclad is the warrior, the Silent is the rogue, and the Defect is kind of like a mage with a bio-mechanical twist \u2013 they each have multiple viable play styles you can try to build your deck around. For example, the Silent can pick up attacks that stack a poison effect on enemies which you can then multiply or burst with rarer cards, but its card pool also supports a deck built around generating tons of free Shiv attack cards and then buffing them with other effects. It feels fantastic when you decide to lean into a certain style and manage to find all of the combo pieces you were hoping for, tearing through enemies with synergies that were specifically designed for each other. But you aren\u2019t always so lucky, and the interesting and ever-changing challenge of Slay the Spire is how you adapt your strategy based on what cards are actually offered to you along the way. And while it can seriously suck to build toward a specific plan and simply never see the key card you need to make it really work, a perk of these short runs is that it\u2019s not too hard to brush off an unlucky loss and try again. The exciting challenge comes from how you adapt to the randomized cards and Relics you find along the way. Outside of cards, you can also find consumable Potions that give you temporary boosts, but the really exciting pickups are the Relics. They can be found in chests and from beating bosses or special elite enemies, and they offer permanent (and often significant) advantages. Some are as simple as a permanent attack boost, while others will do things like randomize the cost of every single card you draw. The more you have, the crazier things get. I loved that many of them have drawbacks to go along with their perk, like Relics that increase the mana you have to play cards at the cost of not being able to heal or gain gold, adding to your pile of difficult decisions. Outside of learning what Relics to pick and which cards to play, it was also fun to figure out Slay the Spire\u2019s monsters and bosses. The art style mixes a million different influences, clearly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, Cthulhu, and much more to stand as something all its own. As a result, you\u2019re fighting everything from tentacle monsters to creepy slimes to giant bird cultists. Each one is a tricky puzzle to solve in its own right, with a variety of unique attacks and abilities to play around. Because you can almost always see roughly what an enemy will do next \u2013 be it attack, defend, or use some sort of buff or debuff \u2013 you have the opportunity strategically time your moves to counter their plans. The enemies are randomly distributed along a simple but amusing dungeon map broken into three main acts, and they get harder and more diverse as you move higher up the Spire. Despite that randomness, it didn\u2019t take long before I started recognizing most of them, which does eventually \u2013 in my case after a couple of dozen hours \u2013 start to make runs feel a bit too similar. I wish there was just a bit more variety, especially when it comes to reusing early enemies in groups later on. But, on the other hand, I also liked learning how to counter what I knew was coming, and the not-to-be-underestimated challenge those enemies pose was enough to keep things feeling fresh for a long time. Thankfully, now that I\u2019ve learned its ins and outs, Slay the Spire has plenty to shake things up and keep me amused. There\u2019s a Daily Climb mode that adds wacky modifiers to a set run each day, letting you compare your score to others on a leaderboard. There are also 20 escalating Ascension difficulty levels if things start to get too easy, each of which slowly adds a new layer to screw you over like increasing boss health or forcing you to fight two of them at the end of each act. But even without all that, beating the unchanging final boss in Slay the Spire\u2019s final fourth act at any difficulty is an extremely tall task, and that will likely keep you chasing the finish line for dozens of hours. But if you do get bored, the modding community on PC has you more than covered. The Steam Workshop is easy to use and is overflowing with custom characters to try, new enemies to fight, and loads of subtle quality-of-life changes. Their quality can be hit and miss, but standouts like the Slimebound character \u2013 which adds a slime enemy as a playable character with new mechanics and unique dialogue \u2013 make it more than worth diving sorting through the rough to find the diamonds.

        "Content": "Not every six-year-old game can feel fresh and modern on a new platform, especially after you take off the 'Ohmigosh it\u2019s on Switch so I can take it anywhere!' goggles. This is my third trip through Diablo 3 since its original release on PC in 2012 and expansion pack-fueled debut on Xbox One in 2014 , and I have to say: it still plays wonderfully. That\u2019s not a huge surprise. What is an unexpected delight is how good Diablo 3 looks on Nintendo\u2019s portable console. The Diablo 3 Eternal Collection doesn\u2019t really offer anything new apart from a Ganondorf armor set, but it does offer everything : the Reaper of Souls expansion that makes you forget about the weak fourth Act, a seventh playable character in the form of the sadistic Necromancer, and every single update and tweak that\u2019s helped Diablo 3 realize its full, enormous potential. It is Diablo 3 in its final form, and it\u2019s simply a blast. Often literally, thanks to the explosive deaths that monsters suffer at your mighty hands. And it looks better than I expected it to, with image quality that suits the Switch\u2019s built-in 720p screen perfectly. When you\u2019re on a 65-inch 4K TV (running in Diablo\u2019s maximum 960p resolution), only the character detail suffers a bit. The environments still look great! Connecting to other players for multiplayer \u2013 both in the same room with local play and online \u2013 was a breeze. And though we tried like hell to bring Diablo 3\u2019s 60fps framerate to its knees on the Switch, it not only didn\u2019t break, it didn\u2019t even flinch. With four players setting off crazy special attacks amidst dozens of monsters onscreen, Diablo 3 on Switch stayed buttery smooth. Even the couple of networking hiccups we encountered couldn\u2019t stop us. The action recovered a few seconds later and we got right back to having fun. Battery life in handheld mode, meanwhile, falls right in line with a typical big-budget Switch release, with roughly two-and-a-half to three hours of playtime.",

        "Content": "Frostpunk combines the best elements of survival, city-building, and 4X games into one of the more captivating strategy games I\u2019ve played in a while. Thanks to stellar presentation and storytelling, it seamlessly combines these different components into one interesting experience that never feels like a burden to play, even when the difficulty of maintaining a colony during an oppressive ice age ratchets up. Frostpunk sets the stage with a compelling and timely backstory in which climate change devastates humanity in the late 1800s. Those left alive must seek out the few remaining resources as they attempt to carve out the last city on Earth. It\u2019s not a hopeful tale, but one that effectively communicates the challenges that lie ahead and sets the stage for some difficult and desperate decisions.  This story is told through outstanding animations that help set a stark tone. Throughout, Frostpunk\u2019s art style is effectively minimalistic and washed out, making each bit of color seem like a touch of warmth in the snow. The overall aesthetic reminded me of a Victorian Game of Thrones, complete with lots of gears and swirling snow. Likewise, the sound design and voice acting pushes the harshness of the landscape. In fact, the sound of a cold wind is the first thing that greets you when launching a new game. Though the graphics challenged my GeForce GTX 880M-powered AlienWare PC, they are bleakly beautiful. Workers carve paths in the snow as they walk, the sunrise splashes across the city, and fires illuminate the buildings around them. Menus are typically clear, though certain functions and iconography are a bit unintuitive. For instance, it took me a while to find the button to build streets. But these issues disappear after playing for an hour or so. Frostpunk is something like an inverse Tropico. \u201c It\u2019s in the gameplay, though, where Frostpunk shines, mixing up bits from various familiar strategy games into something like an inverse Tropico. Rather than selfishly building power over a tropical paradise, here you make decisions for all of what remains of humanity in the midst of a frozen wasteland. Hope and discontent serve as metrics to indicate how you are doing. As the leader of this last city, the most basic task you have is to direct the workforce to gather supplies to keep the community going. This aspect plays out like most real-time city builder or survival games, and your workers will trudge through the snow to bringing coal, steel, and wood back to the city center. I appreciate that Frostpunk limits the number of resources to around five, as there is room for supply chain complexity while still avoiding burdening us with an overabundance of different types of goods. Determining how many workers to send to each stash is a decision you\u2019ll make quite often. In fact, managing the finite number of workers is key to keeping the city going; there will never be as many of them as you\u2019ll want or need. Also making this task difficult is a novel day/night cycle; citizens will only work during the relatively warm daylight shift. Of course, these workers are humans with needs, so the resources they gather will be used to keep them alive. This is where the city-building aspect of Frostpunk comes into play: buildings process goods and provide heat or housing. Like resource collection, this part of gameplay is tightly focused, thanks to a careful selection of buildings and the radiant nature of the city. Most buildings and streets are placed within rings around a central heat-providing generator, and this thematic touch provides a structure that keeps the city-building gameplay from stealing all of your attention. Frostpunk demands political action, too. \u201c This restraint is important, as in addition to managing a workforce, rationing a dwindling supply, and constructing buildings, Frostpunk demands political action, too. As the leader of the city, you\u2019ll be forced to make some hard decisions. Many of these come through the crafting of the \u201cBook of Laws,\u201d a tree of edicts that shape the face of your society. They\u2019re often fascinating moral scenarios that have long-lasting consequences. Will you stretch food supplies by intentionally making awful-tasting soup? Will children be forced to work? What will you do with the gravely ill and the corpses of the dead? Making laws is one thing; responding to personal requests is another. Throughout each game, these emotion-heavy events made me face the consequences of earlier decisions. For instance, employing a child workforce resulted in an accident and a despondent mother. Like 11-bit studios\u2019 previous game, This War of Mine, Frostpunk puts a human face on these decisions and forces you to evaluate survival on both a personal and humanitarian level. These thought-provoking choices, layered on top of a solid management sim and city builder, is what makes Frostpunk stand apart from other recent city games. However, what makes it work so well is its narrow scope. Everything, including the borders of the city, has a limit, meaning that no aspect of the gameplay overtakes the others. I spent as much time managing workers as I did worrying about where to place a hospital tent. With all of these gameplay plates spinning at once, it\u2019s Frostpunk\u2019s restraint that keeps them manageable. Resources are tight, hope is fleeting, and losses happen. \u201c Despite all of these varied elements and mechanics, I never really felt overwhelmed. Sure, resources are tight, hope is fleeting, and losses happen. Once, a lethal combination of straggling refugees, a sudden cold snap, and lack of food caused my citizens' discontent to spiral out of control. The execution center built to help keep order was instead used on me. But generally, a campaign moves along very organically, and everything hangs on a precipitous balance as I try my best to mitigate the damage of the brutally frigid weather. While managing to keep a city thriving is tough, I found the pace in which Frostpunk reveals each new aspect to be ideal. There\u2019s always a new carrot dangled in front of you to keep you hooked, whether it\u2019s a search party exploring a cave or the development of a new technology. Some of those come from side activities, including that exploration component, a moderately-sized technology tree, and other short-term goals. Of these, the exploration gameplay was my favorite because even these remote locations serve up unique decisions that have lasting impacts. For instance, using a scout team to escort rescued children back to the city is the safest, but ties up that team from gathering much-needed resources \u2013 resources that may be needed to build those kids a place to live. Another instance forced me to consider dismantling an abandoned location for immediate assets or keeping it intact for future use.  While the connection between different mechanics isn\u2019t always direct, each element plays into others in interesting ways. For instance, my scout team found an automaton, which then made gathering resources a little easier. Laws can unlock new buildings, which in turn can affect events. Like a complex Choose Your Own Adventure story,  I was often fascinated by this cycle of decisions and consequences. This cycle repeats throughout one playthrough of Frostpunk\u2019s main campaign, which wraps up shortly after an end-game event that occurs around game day 38. (A single playthrough should take around 12 to 15 hours.) This amount of time is enough to complete the entire storyline and see most of what Frostpunk has to offer. Though this mode isn\u2019t completely open-ended, there are enough decision points that playing the campaign multiple times is appealing. Beyond the main campaign are two customizable scenarios that change the focus of your city-building."

        "Content": "A lot of tactical depth can happen on a simple eight-by-eight grid. Into The Breach, the follow-up to the legendary FTL: Faster Than Light from Subset Games, creates a fantastic variety of turn-based tactical battles between your team of three mechs and giant, city-destroying kaiju monsters. On a regular basis, Into The Breach makes me scratch my head and wonder how I\u2019m going to get out of this mess alive. And on a few of those occasions, it\u2019s a thrill when I actually do.  Aside from the subtly detailed animations, the colorful and easily readable pixel-art graphics style does risk Into The Breach being mistaken for a typical simplistic mobile game - though, to be honest, I very much hope it\u2019s eventually ported to phones so I can play it everywhere I go. On the most surface of levels, it\u2019s about moving your units into position to shoot, punch, bombard, push, or otherwise affect the waves of monsters that erupt from the ground, and uses an XCOM-like one move, one attack per turn system that\u2019s become common since 2012. But the way its countless smart rules interact with each other makes learning the nuances of its battle system one of the most rewarding tactical experiences I\u2019ve played in years.   On one of Into The Breach\u2019s semi-roguelike runs (meaning there\u2019s no saving and reloading if something goes wrong) every choice you make feels important, especially after you\u2019ve played a bit and unlocked some new starting options. Each squad of three mechs has a unique set of abilities: you begin with the straightforward Rift Walkers, who have a simple melee bot with a damaging knockback punch, a tank with a damaging knockback shot, and an artillery unit that damages a tile and knocks back all adjacent tiles. But then you can unlock the Blitzkrieg, who have a Lightning Mech with an electrified whip that hits everything adjacent to its target in an unlimited chain of damage, a Hook Mech that grapples enemies and moves them adjacent to it, and the Boulder Mech which launches giant rocks that deal damage, push back horizontally adjacent units, and can obstruct a tile. Or the Flame Behemoths or Frozen Titans, whose specialties you can probably guess but come with some unexpected twists that make them great to experiment with. You can even build your own squad by mixing and matching mechs from any of the ones you\u2019ve unlocked in search of brand new strategies.  You can improve your chances considerably by avoiding tougher battles until you\u2019re ready. \u201c  On top of that, you get to pick one special pilot from an unlockable set of 13 who add a unique ability to whichever mech you assign them to, amplifying the potential starting combinations through the roof before you even begin to upgrade your team. If, for example, you put Abe Isamu in a unit like the Zenith Guard\u2019s Charge Mech, which can ram enemies from any distance, his armor trait will negate the damage that mech would deal to itself by doing so. Or, if you place Silica in the Boulder Mech, you can launch two long-range attacks in a single turn that - if you\u2019re positioned correctly so you don\u2019t need to move - can obstruct two squares. (The other two pilots you start each run with are relatively expendable, but can gain experience and level up for small bonuses.)  Then you pick which of the four islands you\u2019ll visit first, which takes some thought. The terrain conditions on each are fairly consistent: For instance, you\u2019ll always see breakable ice and freezing storms on the wintery island, water and flammable foliage in the green island, dunes that can spawn dust clouds when hit and lightning storms on the desert island, and acid pools and conveyor belts all over the tech island. But the diverse set of enemies and the boss you\u2019ll face are randomized each game, so you have to consider which ones your squad is best equipped to counter. I absolutely hate the slugs that launch spider eggs that first entrap any units adjacent to it and then spawn an extra enemy you have to deal with, so I avoid those until I\u2019ve upgraded enough to improve my odds of dealing with them. And if I\u2019m using a squad that doesn\u2019t deal a lot of direct damage, taking on the dividing blob boss early rarely works out well. You can improve your chances considerably by avoiding those tougher battles until you\u2019re ready.   Once on an island, you pick which of the regions to fight in based on their risks, side objectives, and natural hazards, and also which ones you need to complete to unlock access to others you want (because you can only attack an adjacent territory). Because you can only fight five battles on each island before the boss appears, you have to make sure you\u2019re picking wisely: do you want to go for as many upgrade points as possible or focus on gaining power for your grid (effectively your overall health) as a buffer against taking damage later? And is it worth taking on tougher missions to try to do both at once?  Battle Chess  Of course, the battlefield is where things get really interesting. Enemies always move first and telegraph their attacks, making every turn a clever puzzle about how to prevent monsters from striking vital targets, or, better yet, to redirect their attacks back at their allies by nudging them around the map. The order of operations can make or break your move; holding the Alt key will expose the order in which enemies will attack, so you can set up situations where it may appear as though the enemy is still threatening a target but you\u2019ll know that another enemy will be tricked into killing it for you before it gets the chance to attack. At the same time, smacking an enemy will often move them to another tile (depending on the type of attack) and if you didn\u2019t take that into account you can easily block yourself from making another move you had planned. And there are always unforeseen circumstances until you\u2019ve mastered everything: maybe you didn\u2019t account for the sand dune on a square that, when attacked, creates a dust cloud that makes it impossible to attack from that position.  So it\u2019s great that you can undo as many moves as you like until you attack, and once per mission you\u2019re allowed to reset time to the start of the turn (unless you\u2019ve brought Isaac Jones, who gives you a second one). That allows for at least some limited save-scum experimentation before you\u2019re committed and makes learning tough lessons sting considerably less than they would otherwise.  Into The Breach Screenshots 13 Images  But because the civilian buildings on the tactical maps actually represent your overall health - called the power grid - and enough damage to them will end your run, protecting them can be more important than the survival of any mech. That means it\u2019s usually better to absorb damage yourself, even if it means one of your mech pilots will be killed and replaced by an AI that can\u2019t be leveled up (which would otherwise confer random benefits like increased movement range or extra hit points). Learning when to sacrifice a mech by placing it between a threat and civilians and when to take the hit to your power grid is part of Into The Breach\u2019s elaborate balancing act.  Learning when to sacrifice a mech and when to take the hit to your power grid is part of Into The Breach\u2019s elaborate balancing act. \u201c  Civilian buildings are also the only place in Into The Breach\u2019s combat where randomness comes into play, in that they have a chance to resist taking damage when hit. The odds start at a low 15%, but can be increased by earning more power after maxing out your power grid meter. Everything else is certain: there are no critical hits, no unexpected misses, and no events that aren\u2019t telegraphed a turn in advance. That makes it feel almost entirely fair, with the one unpredictable thing being a chance for something to work out in your favor.  Into The Breach\u2019s quick mission maps aren\u2019t randomly generated, but there are factors that make them feel different each time. For one, a wide variety of side objectives, such as protecting a train that moves across the map, using an acid launcher to destroy all the mountains on the map, or freezing and protecting a pair of hostile robots help keep one from feeling too similar to another. Other maps have natural hazards you can use to your advantage, like a tidal wave that wipes away an entire row of the map each turn (which you can bait or shove non-flying enemies into to kill them, but won\u2019t damage your mechs), lightning storms that destroy anything on four randomly chosen tiles each turn, or ice storms that freeze anything that happens to be standing in a large area at the end of a turn. There\u2019s also the chance for a Time Pod to crash-land on the map, challenging you to either collect them or prevent the enemy from destroying them before the mission ends to earn rewards like new abilities, extra upgrade resources, or new special pilots. Because a mission usually only lasts for five turns, there\u2019s a lot of pressure to accomplish all its objectives in a short time.   Since you only ever have three mechs on the field (unless you equip a small deployable tank, or in certain missions where you\u2019re defending weaker friendly units) every battle is a struggle to keep from being outnumbered by the enemies who are constantly emerging from the ground. If there are five enemies attacking and only three mechs responding, that means two of your three mechs must come up with ways to stop two enemies - and that\u2019s not easy. That gives rise to situations where you have to make tough decisions on whether you want to save a civilian building, strike a killing blow on an existing enemy, or prevent a new one from arriving on the battlefield by parking a mech on a spawn point. You take a point of damage, sure, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for one less enemy to deal with next turn.  Kobayashi Maru  Some situations can feel like no-wins, especially when the enemy AI decides to ignore your mechs and concentrate all its fire on buildings, which can\u2019t be moved out of the way. You can predict where they can move by clicking on them during your turn to see their movement radius, but what they won\u2019t always do what you expect. In those cases, \u201cwinning\u201d becomes mitigating the damage as best you can, and because you can still win a partial victory even if you fail one objective it\u2019s not the end of the world. But often, what at first seems like certain doom can be solved, and that\u2019s the best feeling in Into The Breach.  At the end of each island, you spend the resources you\u2019ve collected on buying and powering up a randomly available assortment of upgrades that can dramatically change the way your mechs behave. Many are drawn from the other mech teams, letting you mix and match to create hybrid units, plus an assortment of other powers like the ability to hit every enemy on the map once per mission or a passive ability that causes civilian buildings to create a force field after they take damage to prevent a second hit. Like with FTL\u2019s randomly stocked stores, this setup forces you to think and improvise as you play the hand you\u2019re dealt instead of repeating the same successful strategy over and over, and adds terrifically to replayability.   One opportunity that Into The Breach feels as though it misses is that there\u2019s not much dynamic storytelling going on, beyond some contextual chatter from your pilots and the governors of each island that celebrate individual victories or lament losses suffered. Each run feels pretty much the same as far as story, which - if you compare it directly to the similarly structured FTL - makes them a little less memorable. The alternate-timeline wrapper that lets one experienced surviving pilot warp back in time and join your next run (whether you win or lose) gives it just enough flavor for there to be what feels like a distinctive Into The Breach universe.  It\u2019s a small-looking tactics game that\u2019s kept me playing more intently than most big ones. \u201c  The two-phase final mission is a little anticlimactic in that it\u2019s not that different from the boss battles you\u2019ve already fought, and follows a very similar pattern each time. It\u2019s definitely not easy - it took me over a dozen attempts to reach and finally beat it, including several times when I came within a single turn of beating it, only to fail - but having now done it a few times, it\u2019s starting to feel like the most routine part of Into The Breach. Its saving grace is the fact that by the time you get there you\u2019ve likely geared up your squad with significantly different abilities, so at least the way you fight it is different.  I must also mention the musical score by FTL composer Ben Prunty, which is very similar in its low-fi electronic style. It\u2019s also similar in that it\u2019s fantastic at setting a sci-fi mood, and I could listen to it all day without it ever getting repetitious."

        "Content": "Like Shadow of Mordor before it, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is so much more than just another open-world action game with Batman\u2019s combat. Its amazing Nemesis system makes almost every encounter with a named enemy a memorable battle, and the new fortress sieges give it legs beyond the campaign through asynchronous multiplayer. This story plays just as fast and loose with Lord of the Rings\u2019 lore as the last time. It picks up after the conjoined spirits of ancient elf lord Celebrimbor and Aragorn stunt double Talion forge a new Ring of Power\u2026 and immediately lose it. Their beefs with the weirdly sexy human form of the giant spider Shelob, the Witch King, and even Sauron himself (again) feel drawn out and filled with plenty of clunky, derivative dialogue, but there are some strong moments.  Flashbacks to the Ringwraiths\u2019 corruption give the ghostly Nazgul a tragic side, battles with the fiery Balrog are big on spectacle, and witnessing the founding of Minas Morgul (several hundred years later than J.R.R Tolkien suggested) are all standouts \u2013 if you can stomach the non-canon version of events. A growing conflict between the stoic and pragmatic Celebrimbor and the empathetic and Gondor-loyal Talion adds some depth to both characters, though with all the setup I was expecting a choice between their philosophies that never came. And there are a few original characters, especially the returning Ratbag, who provide some decent comic relief in the absence of dwarves or hobbits. Each of the five zones looks markedly different. \u201c The story goes to interesting places \u2013 visually, at least. Each of Shadow of War\u2019s five zones looks markedly different, and fast-traveling between the icy mountains of Sergost to the green swamps of Nurnen and the volcanic Gorgoroth gives it a good sense of variety. Each area is full of ruins and other structures to climb on and tunnels to explore, plus an urban Fortress area unlike anything in Shadow of Mordor\u2019s map. On the other hand, that variety is only skin deep: all the locations are functionally identical (there are no effects of heat or cold and no unique conditions) and each one is inhabited by the same types of enemies and wildlife. And their beauty is sometimes disfigured by some nasty pop-in that can leave terrain textures looking almost literally like something out of Minecraft \u2013 it\u2019s especially pronounced on stone walls in ruins. (From time to time I\u2019ve also spotted enemies with completely blank faces that pop in after a few moments.)  Each region is a respectable size, which means there\u2019s quite a lot of running from place to place as you chase down quest markers, but Talion\u2019s moves make movement quick and fun. You start with or quickly unlock most of the running powers from the end of Shadow of Mordor, which make you work for your speed boosts by tapping the run button as you vault over objects and leap between handholds on walls. You also get an indispensable new double-jump ability which allows you to leap longer distances and change direction mid-air. I rarely jump without it anymore, even when I don\u2019t need it, because it feels so good to use. The catch is that, like in most open-world games in which you can climb nearly anything, there\u2019s an annoying tendency of sticking to the wrong thing or getting stuck briefly to a ledge when you wanted to roll off of it. There\u2019s a remarkable range of voices, faces, and armor types. \u201c All of these areas are absolutely crawling with uruks, and it\u2019s from encounters with them \u2013 specifically their leaders \u2013 that the real story of Shadow of War arises. It\u2019s great to constantly run into colorful characters with names like Khrosh the Pickler, Grom the Corruptor, and Borgu the Bard, who serenades you with his lute before he attacks. There\u2019s a remarkable range of voices (I\u2019ve lost count, but if there are less than 100 I\u2019d be surprised) and faces and bodies are modified with a huge number of helmet and armor types and disgusting disfigurements. I\u2019m still seeing new voices, faces, and armor elements even after 50 hours.  Some uruks become enraged over literally everything. \u201c Underneath, each has their own random combination of a huge selection of class-based abilities, strengths to counter, and fears and weaknesses to exploit. It\u2019s a far more in-depth system than what we saw in Shadow of Mordor, with everything from being equipped with flaming or poisoned weaponry and flashbombs to more complex and scarier abilities like killing you outright, ignoring the Last Chance mechanic that allows you to save yourself when you run out of health. Some are immune to execution moves or arrows, and some can defy death and come back at you with a second wind just at you think you\u2019ve won. Some become enraged (making them attack with more ferocity and impossible to pacify until they calm down a notch) at certain moves, like vaulting over them or using a freeze power \u2013 and some become enraged over literally everything. Some have weaknesses that let you instantly kill them with fire or stealth attacks, others have only slight vulnerabilities to certain damage types. (If the annoying immunity to melee weapons from Shadow of Mordor exists in Shadow of War, I haven\u2019t encountered it.) Though it\u2019s generally easy to interrogate a lacky uruk and learn a captain\u2019s weaknesses, sometimes I prefer to go in blind and discover their traits by trial and error in combat. Other things can\u2019t be predicted as easily: sometimes enemy uruks will ambush you out of nowhere, or they\u2019ll turn on you when you least suspect it. They\u2019re full of surprises and personality, so much so that It\u2019s almost a shame to lop their heads and limbs off with spectacularly animated, slow-motion finishing moves.  Uruk captains are also walking meat pinatas full of potentially game-changing loot, which ranges from a sword that has a chance to set things on fire to a suit of armor that actively heals you while you\u2019re on fire. The higher the level of the uruk you kill, the better the potential of the gear that will drop. That makes it an interesting tradeoff to kill an uruk captain instead of brainwashing him and recruiting him into your army.  Each piece of rare, epic, or legendary loot comes with a challenge to unlock its more powerful traits: for instance, kill X enemies while mounted on a tiger-like Caragor and your sword will suddenly do more damage while your health is low, or throw Y enemies off of ledges to activate your cape\u2019s power to make your allies do more damage in combat. Thanks to these side goals there\u2019s always something new to do as you fight, and there\u2019s always another reward waiting for you. Some of those challenges are built around the absurdly forgiving stealth (you can pretty much run right up to an uruk and stab him to death before anyone notices), but most are active and interesting. There\u2019s also a Diablo-like gem crafting and slotting system, which lets you customize your build on each piece of gear to suit your playstyle with enhanced damage, health, or chances for good-quality drops.  Dozens of orcs can flood the screen at once. \u201c Just like in Shadow of Mordor, individual rank-and-file uruks are so non-threatening they\u2019re basically health pickups. Literally \u2013 the quickest way to restore your health is to drain it from an unsuspecting victim (or one of the rats that scurry around in certain areas). But when dozens of them flood the screen at once they\u2019re a force to be reckoned with, and they\u2019ll beat on you if you try to suck the life out of their friends. When a captain enters a fray like that it\u2019s like a scene in a movie in which two opposing heroes spot each other across the battlefield and cut a swath through their armies to fight. So it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed, even when Talion is leveled up with ridiculously powerful abilities like teleporting to any basic enemy in sight and instantly killing them with Shadow Strike. The skill tree is impressively flexible, with each of its dozens of unlockable abilities having two or three possible upgrades (one of which can be active at a time) that can, for instance, let you summon a caragor, a rancor-like graug, or even a drake for a mount. You level up frequently enough that there's always something new to experiment with. 27 Images  Knowing when to back off and find a way to heal up is key: thanks to Talion\u2019s mobility and most uruk\u2019s relatively slow speed it\u2019s almost always easy to escape when you need to. But especially when you\u2019re in tight quarters, Shadow of War is much better at keeping the pressure on than Shadow of Mordor, and high-level uruks just keep on coming, so its fights never get quite as easy toward the end. Considering it\u2019s actually impactful and sort of fun to die because of the way the enemy uruks rank up, that\u2019s a very good thing. Any nameless uruk who gets in a lucky shot becomes a captain as a reward \u2013 and also becomes a great target for satisfying revenge. Drakes are some of the most impressive dragon fights since Skyrim. \u201c It\u2019s true that you could count the enemy types that didn\u2019t appear in Shadow of Mordor on one hand, and I\u2019d have liked to have seen more variety in different locations. But the few that are there do have a major impact: the hulking ologs, which resemble the cave trolls from the Lord of the Rings films, make quite an impression with their heavy hitting blows and the way they\u2019ll snag you out of the air and spike you like a football if you try to flip over them. And when a drake flies overhead, its fire breath changes things up considerably: you have to move fast to avoid the foreshadowed blast zone. When they land, they\u2019re some of the most impressive looking dragon fights since Skyrim, and when you gain the ability to ride them they become some of Shadow of War\u2019s most powerful weapons (unless someone has a fire immunity).  Outside of siege trolls and sappers, the only other notable new enemies are the Nazgul themselves, who make ghostly appearances for boss fights and each require specific moves to make them vulnerable to attack. Those fights can get tough, especially when they happen in the midst of a larger brawl where it\u2019s hard to focus on countering everything at once. The battle with the fortress Overlord is no joke. \u201c The biggest new features of Shadow of War are its fortresses, which you can conquer with a large-scale invasion force of brainwashed uruks that you customize and upgrade before each assault. The battles are impressive in that there are probably between 100 and 200 uruks running around hacking each other to bits, but the process of breaching walls and holding capture points tends to be pretty easy: you\u2019ve got an army backing you up, led by your fiercest captains and upgraded with everything from mounted cavalry to siege artillery in support, so unless you\u2019re drastically outmatched by the other side, the first stage of a siege isn\u2019t going to present much of a problem. (I\u2019ve yet to actually fail one of these.) But the battle at the end with the local Overlord and his henchmen is no joke: not only are they generally powerful uruks, but the throne rooms are usually rigged up with flame or poison sprayers, and they constantly throw new henchmen at you to deprive you of breathing room.  Uruks you capture are essentially loot. \u201c Once you\u2019ve taken a fortress, you get to appoint your own forces to defend it against invasions, both as part of the story and in the asynchronous multiplayer where other players can basically download a copy of your uruks to fight (meaning they don\u2019t die if they successfully conquer your fortress). This means uruks you capture are essentially loot, too, with Epic and Legendary captains presenting the most potential for causing trouble for invaders. You can\u2019t expect any uruk force to stop a competent player, but you can sure slow them down, and speed is what you\u2019re scored on when leading a conquest. Leveling promising uruks up by sending them on assassination missions against hostile uruks or in AI-versus-AI pit fights gives them an almost Pokemon-like feeling, except with the added tension of a favorite uruk dying if they lose. But there\u2019s not enough control over your armies in either invasions or the defenses to make them feel really strategic. You don\u2019t get to position your troops on the map, and you can\u2019t place any traps or anything to funnel the enemy into their doom \u2013 defensive upgrades like spouts of poisonous goo or caged drakes serving as flamethrowers are pre-placed. You pretty much just wind up your toy soldiers and let them fight it out on their own \u2013 which is plenty entertaining to watch as it happens around you, but not much of a challenge. These battles and the buildup to them is where you're likely to spend the majority of your time with Shadow of War. The campaign missions are in the 15 to 20-hour range, but I easily spent that long again fighting uruks to create my armies and doing both campaign and online sieges. On top of that are a good number of challenge missions, presented as flashbacks to Celebrimbor's heyday, and plenty of collectibles to keep you busy.  The other online feature is carried over from Shadow of Mordor: if you\u2019re killed, other players get a chance at killing the uruk who killed you, and vice versa. Joining one of those Vendetta missions is a good way to make sure you get a proven challenge: usually, if an uruk has killed someone it\u2019s not going to be a pushover. This is a great way to score some of Shadow of War\u2019s somewhat redundant loot boxes, if you\u2019re so inclined. On that note, a quick word about the controversial microtransactions: you can and totally should ignore them completely. Buying loot boxes is just a way to get loot that isn\u2019t killing uruks, which is the best thing about Shadow of War. It\u2019s especially bizarre that these exist because so much of the allure of Shadow of War is that its enemies basically are loot boxes to begin with. So in buying them, you\u2019d basically be paying to avoid scratching off the metaphorical lottery ticket that is an uruk\u2019s head to reveal the loot you\u2019re about to acquire. On top of that, I\u2019ve had more than enough of the in-game silver currency to buy whatever I\u2019ve needed in terms of upgrades (it\u2019s used to enhance gear or unlock slots captain slots for sieges and defenses), so there\u2019s been no need or even desire to spend a dime."

        "Content": "I spent the majority of my six-hour playthrough of Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice grasping for a touchstone to understand the experience. It unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it\u2019s punctuated by moments of beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me. It follows the titular Senua, a celtic warrior, who embarks on a mission to the homeland of the Northmen in order to penetrate the depths of their version of hell, the mythological Norse land of the dead called Helheim. It's bound by threads of historical fiction, historical non-fiction, mythology, and metaphor all admirably weaved together to create a unique backdrop that's ripe for exploring the darker tones and themes Hellblade tackles. But as impressive as its story is, Ninja Theory\u2019s smart design reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and intuitive mechanics. Even before the game begins, you're prompted to play with headphones in order to capitalize on the binaural audio design (simulated three-dimensional sound). This is used to great effect as the voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone. Voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone. \u201c And in truth, you never really are alone in Hellblade, for better or worse. These voices speak directly to Senua, each other, and perhaps even to you. They impart advice, they argue about her actions, they tear her down and pick her up at the best and most inopportune times. This fact, coupled with the excellent original score, the never-faltering voice work, and the ambient sounds both real and imagined make for an audial experience that's as vivid and liberal as anything that happens before your eyes. Visually Hellblade is a gorgeous game to take in \u2013 sun-soaked rocky beaches, vividly distorted streaks of color and light, and deep darkness that strangles the screen, there's a variety of hues, saturation, and exposures that convey meaning in most areas. This variety is further improved when playing on the PS4 Pro, which makes use of an \"enhanced resolution\" or a smoother, more immersive 60 frames-per-second. And while Ninja Theory is no stranger to including full-motion video in the past (Enslaved's use of Andy Serkis comes to mind), Hellblade's use takes it to another degree by splicing in real footage of secondary characters' performances through a heavily distorted filter that creates impactful scenes between real and animated characters without feeling out of place. I was consistently, pleasantly surprised by the number of ways Ninja Theory was able to present these moments, all without breaking the immersion of the world and story. Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it\u2019s a game or a story. Hellblade revolves around Senua\u2019s perception of her environment, drawing connections between her beliefs and the geometry of the world. \u201c For example, there\u2019s no HUD in Hellblade - yet that chorus of voices shout panicked advice at Senua in the heat of battle. \"Behind you!\" one of them screams seconds before an enemy stabs at Senua's back. There\u2019s no combat tutorial either. Your first moments of do-or-die battle begin without warning. There\u2019s no objective markers or mini map, which are only occasionally frustrating when backtracking to look for the collectible lorestones scattered throughout the world. Hellblade is a game that you\u2019re not supposed to trust, because what you see, or hear, or feel, is rarely truthful. And because of that there are moments of terrifying tension that gave me an amount of anxiety and panic that\u2019s borderline uncomfortable. For example, in one section I guided Senua through a pitch-black area filled with shapeless hair-raising creatures that would lunge out when she got too close. These moments evoke the vibes of a horror game that are sparse enough to be shocking when I haplessly wandered into them, but effective enough that I worried for Senua's safety with that ever-present nagging of permanent death. Yet most of Hellblade revolves around Senua\u2019s perception of her environment, drawing connections between her beliefs and the geometry of the world. You\u2019ll scour each area, lining up beams, or trees, so the shapes of the world around her take on significance and unlock the next door that blocks her progression. As new puzzle elements are slowly added \u2013 like fractured walkways and doors that require a precise viewing angle to be reassembled, or portals that force you to enter entirely different versions of the world \u2013 these puzzles take on new layers of depth, and meaning. These moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover something new. \u201c And many of these moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover something new \u2013 like a hidden path that can only been seen through a specific portal \u2013 because they're reinforced by the story that's made all this impossibility plausible. Surprisingly, combat in Hellblade is more of a palate cleanser than a core element. It punctuates the story with wave-based enemies that block progress until defeated, making use of Senua's light attack, heavy attack, parry, dodge, and charge. Though these moves do combine together to create a varied enough skill set when facing the same half-dozen enemy types, progression feels stunted since new abilities only slightly modify the core of the combat, rather than redefine it. The simple nature of the combat design struck me as obligatory for the sake of interactivity \u2013 giving you another way to interact with the world outside of perception \u2013 coupled with the fact a warrior should be defined by battle. But there were only a few fights where large groups of enemies were thrown at me that I ever felt threatened and it's only near the end of the journey when enemy numbers and difficulty spike unexpectedly that the combat depth eventually becomes more than the sum of its parts. And yet, like most of Hellblade, combat is still a tense experience knowing that dying too many times (in or out of combat) will cause your save to be deleted and you\u2019ll be forced to start from the beginning. While that might sound draconian in execution, its tie-ins to the story are concrete, reinforcing a system where failure carries meaning rather than simply acting like a gimmick to artificially inflate difficulty. And though I don't think I ever got close to having my save data destroyed, every time I got close to dying carried much more weight and impact with this knowledge."

For one thing, the full bundle \u2013 called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove \u2013 is a great peek into how far an indie studio can come in just a few years. The original Shovel Knight is a small but polished 2D action game with great platforming, an arsenal of varied tools, and a surprisingly well-written story. And while Plague of Shadows feels like a remixed addition for hardcore fans, Specter of Torment feels like a completely new game, and one that shows off everything Yacht Club has learned since the original\u2019s release in 2014. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The Switch version has a ton of features that are either new or will be new to many of those who haven\u2019t played Shovel Knight since it first came out. The base game (Shovel of Hope) has co-op now, for example, made even better by the Switch\u2019s multiplayer-friendly Joy-Con controllers (although it\u2019s overall better with the more precise Switch Pro Controller and its actual D-pad) and the system\u2019s general portability. There are amiibo features too \u2013 you can personalize a custom knight and easily bring it to a friend\u2019s system for co-op, or if you have a custom knight saved from a previous Nintendo platform you can import it with a tap. New to this iteration is the Fairy of Shovelry, a small sprite amiibo owners can summon to zip around the screen while you play. The fairy isn\u2019t useful, as it mimes picking up treasure and fighting enemies without having any actual effect. But it is cute. Treasure Trove also has the new \u201cbody swap\u201d feature, which lets you fiddle with the gender and identifying pronouns (he/she etc.) for every main character. Making all the knights female and the Enchantress male \u2013 turning her into the Enchanter \u2013 is a nice way to make Shovel Knight feel fresh again, and you can tune the story to your liking. Unfortunately, body swap is currently only available in the original game, Shovel of Hope, though it\u2019s reasonable to hope the developers might add it to the expansions in a future update. The real draw for returning players is going to be the brand-new expansion, Specter of Torment. It adds so much to the overall package, more than simply a set of new story missions. Take the new challenge accessible from Specter Knight\u2019s hub world -- a tower that stretches into the heavens and begs to be climbed. An empty suit of armor named Horace guards the entrance to its constantly rearranging heights. He challenges you to reach the top, a feat that can only be accomplished with lightning-fast reflexes and precise platforming. It\u2019s not the most difficult area in Treasure Trove, but its balance of challenge and replayability makes it great. Then there\u2019s the campaign, which stands easily on its own. A prequel story, this adventure follows Specter Knight on his quest to convince the other knights to join the Enchantress\u2019s Order of No Quarter. With that description, you\u2019d think it would retread the same territory the original and Plague of Shadows did, but Specter breaks a surprising amount of new ground and packs in a lot of brand-new content. It took me over seven hours to get through Specter\u2019s story and beat Horace\u2019s tower, and that time didn\u2019t even count any of the new challenges (which include more alternate boss fights) or the new game plus mode you unlock after beating the story. Like Plague Knight before him, Specter Knight gets a huge pool of unique abilities and attacks to play with. He can run up some walls and surf or grind along fast-moving rails, creating new opportunities for platforming challenges. While in the air his attacks cause him to zip toward enemies, and whether he hurtles toward the ground or flies upward depends entirely on your angle and timing. This definitely takes getting used to, and even several hours in you might get flustered by the number of jumps you flub. Frustration can, unfortunately, mount, especially on more difficult levels, although with no overworld map you can tackle each mission in whatever order you choose, so it\u2019s easy to walk away from a problem and come back later when you\u2019re not as angry. Even so, Specter Knight marks a big improvement over Plague Knight\u2019s arsenal in Plague of Shadows. Although it\u2019s rewarding to tinker with Plague\u2019s bombs to try to make the perfect tool for each new situation, controlling the alchemist through double-jumps and explosion bursts feels awkward and imprecise. In comparison, Specter Knight feels totally fluid and skill-based, bringing to mind old Castlevania classics. It wouldn\u2019t be Shovel Knight without a slew of cool extra upgrades and abilities, and Specter Knight delivers. One of Specter\u2019s alternate cloaks lets him scythe-grind on any surface, including spikes, while another grants him recharging \u201cdarkness\u201d (power for using abilities) when you destroy the checkpoint orbs throughout a level, which puts you at risk of losing a lot of progress should you die. Meanwhile Specter\u2019s unlockable \u201ccurios\u201d include powerful moves that let you float through the air, pass through walls to attack enemies all over the screen, and recharge your health on a whim. If playing as Plague Knight sometimes feels like hard mode due to the strangeness of that character\u2019s movements, Specter Knight\u2019s devastating attacks can make playing as him feel like cheating. It was in danger of feeling too easy until the later levels, which really ramped up the challenge to compensate. One of the best surprises in Specter of Torment is that unlike in Plague of Shadows, which reused the same levels from the original Shovel Knight, the new expansion features almost a dozen completely redesigned or brand-new stages. Each takes advantage of Specter Knight\u2019s versatile movement style and unique abilities in fun ways, including regular sections that require you to scythe-swipe between targets while barely ever touching the ground. Specter\u2019s hub world, where you go to chat with minions, buy armor upgrades, test out new abilities, and more, is also totally different from the village in past versions (unsurprisingly, Specter Knight feels more at home in the Enchantress\u2019 fortress than among the cheery villagers). Plague of Shadows toyed with similar ideas by revealing Plague Knight\u2019s secret lab under the village tavern, but for Specter, the developers went all out. And that\u2019s consistent throughout the expansion. Shovel Knight has always had a surprisingly deep and well-written story for a game in this old-school, pixelated tradition, and Specter of Torment takes it to new depths as Specter struggles to convince the other knights to join his cause \u2013 and faces off with each of them in turn. And like the new stages, each boss has been redesigned to better face off with Specter. Black Knight, for example, rides into battle on a spiked turtle/rhino thing named Terrorpin, and that\u2019s just the first boss fight in the expansion. Each new ally joins the Order for a feast back in the hub area, and you can check in with them for funny dialogue and character moments in between missions. There are even flashback scenes that flesh out the ghostly Specter Knight\u2019s backstory, showing his motivations are more complex than Plague Knight\u2019s \u201cmore power!\u201d and even Shovel Knight\u2019s \u201csave your friend!\u201d Specter Knight\u2019s motivation for spending hours trying to defeat Horace\u2019s tower climb challenge, on the other hand, remains a mystery \u2013 unless you count my own obsession."

        "Content": "Update: Titanfall 2 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .  When Respawn Entertainment first showed off its concept for Titanfall and hinted at a single- and multiplayer first-person shooter full of acrobatic action and towering robot warriors that could rival Call of Duty, Titanfall 2 is the game that I wanted to play. Respawn has doubled down on its compelling formula of breakneck movement and grandiose scale, tapping the vein of those literal and figurative explosive moments that we brag about afterwards. And this time around, the first game\u2019s lacking single-player component has been addressed with admirable results, offering an engaging trek through a universe that was begging to be fleshed out. On The Campaign Trail Titanfall 2\u2019s campaign is the tale of rifleman Jack Cooper, who\u2019s unexpectedly given the reins of Vanguard-class titan BT-7274 (AKA \u201cBT\u201d) when the two are stranded on the planet Typhon after their starship was brought down in an ambush by the evil mega-corp IMC. Their pairing is a good one, if somewhat predictable, with both characters playing off one another in the fashion of their archetypes. BT\u2019s artificial intelligence personality is dry, logical, and ready to misunderstand Jack\u2019s human colloquialisms and turns-of-phrase for slight comedic effect, while Jack is the relatable everyman grunt who knows next to nothing about being a pilot, much less a hero. Though their dynamic doesn\u2019t quite reach the level of witty buddy-comedy quips and playful banter that some of the dialogue options strive for, what does come across is a genuine mutual respect and, in time, caring that these two find for one another. Nine chapters of excellent level design showcase Respawn\u2019s genuine talent. \u201c This sets the stage for the pair to work together through nine chapters of excellent level design that showcases Respawn\u2019s genuine talent for conveying scale. Each chapter is a sprawling playground of twisting jungle valleys, massive factories, military structures, and debris fields, each seeped in their own dense atmosphere thanks to gorgeous vistas and dramatic lighting. Playing through the approximately six-hour campaign I was impressed that each level felt big enough for me to sprint, hurdle, double-jump, and wall-run through while also being well enough organized that I never felt lost. It\u2019s linear, but open enough to create an illusion of freedom. Only occasionally was I forced to stop and consult the objective beacon, which is great considering the amount of time I spent dashing through mazes of massive air ducts or across assembly lines big enough to construct entire buildings. Typhon\u2019s environments are as much your enemy as the humans and robots. \u201c Everywhere I looked I was reminded of my relatively insignificant size. I felt small standing next to a titan and significantly larger when piloting BT, but always dwarfed by the unbelievably large and intricate structures that tower over even your bulky robot. Levels are deftly crafted with both titan and pilot in mind, requiring you to wade through toxic sludge or a cloud of poison while inside the titan until a bottomless chasm or narrow catwalk forces you to hop out and pinball between walls and railings with strings of leaps and dashes in order to clear a path for your companion to follow. In fact, Typhon\u2019s environments are as much your enemy in Titanfall 2 as the humans and robots that bar your progression. Extreme heat, cold, fatal falls, hazardous waste, and deadly electrical discharges are ever-present obstacles that provide a sense of weight to learning and excelling at Titanfall 2\u2019s signature movement abilities. Jumping Jack (Cooper) Flash To Respawn\u2019s credit, the platforming design is as refreshing as any I\u2019ve encountered in a first-person shooter. Throughout the campaign, new mechanics are consistently introduced that range from neat additions to wholly new puzzle elements, like using cranes to move wall-running surfaces into place to create paths. By the end, you\u2019re fully expected to be able to combine them all to get through a series of complex obstacle courses that mix acrobatics and combat. In one late-game on-foot section I was forced to bounce from wall to wall while swapping items midair to power switches that swung the next wall into place for me to land on it. This kind of frantic precision is electrifying when you\u2019re sprinting above the floorless abyss, where poor timing or a missed input of the smooth and intuitive controls means falling to your death. New mechanics are consistently introduced. \u201c And throughout each dense level, swarms of IMC grunts, humanesque elite robots, Typhon\u2019s indigenous fauna, and massive titans all punctuate the platforming with heavy combat encounters. While most of the soldiers and robots serve as cannon fodder with predictable but effective AI, their numbers, explosive ordinance, and well-equipped titans are still lethal if not respected. Though your impressive on-foot mobility can often allow you to dash through combat areas toward the objective without firing a single shot or stopping to clean up the enemies, doing so would be a disservice. Titanfall 2 is loaded with an enjoyable collection of punchy firearm types, like the powerhouse automatic shotgun and the electric-sphere-firing rocket launcher, most of Titanfall 2\u2019s firearms have a sci-fi flare - culminating in the infamous fire-and-forget accuracy of the smart pistol. When combined with the smooth movement and melee attacks, this varied arsenal offers moments of catharsis and satisfaction when you decimate a room full of enemies without being tagged. Hearing an enemy soldier call out, \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d after annihilating his entire squad like a shotgun tornado and disappearing into the rafters with a few precise leaps is next-level empowering. The Iron Giant But when you\u2019re inside your slower and more grounded titan the combat becomes more conventional first-person shooting, though just as impactful thanks to its unusual flexibility. Unlike the multiplayer titans, BT is capable of swapping loadouts on the fly to become a totally different class, equipping unique weapons, abilities, and defensive items just by calling up the menu and selecting what you need at the time. I\u2019d regularly default to the standard machine gun loadout for its versatility, but when a fast, nimble enemy titan took the field, switching to a loadout with heat-seeking rockets and a jetpack is much more effective for connecting shots. When dozens of smaller grunts and robots peppered me with rockets, I\u2019d swap to the napalm-infused Scorch loadout for its area-of-effect destructiveness. It\u2019s a refreshing change of pace, especially considering each of these loadouts becomes available shortly after defeating a named boss titan \u2013 a la Mega Man \u2013 lending a sense of earned progression. These bosses are part of a mercenary corp called the Apex Predators, and each sports their own personality and cosmetically unique titan. When you finally square off against one, you\u2019re treated to a brief introductory cinematic which helps to ratchet up the stakes, but I unfortunately found these chapter-punctuating encounters to be underwhelming. On normal difficulty, they regularly only took slightly more effort to bring down than the standard titans of similar chassis I\u2019d fought before. Their personas and rewards are the memorable parts. BT\u2019s versatility allows you to use several of the titan chassis from multiplayer. \u201c The advantage of BT\u2019s versatility for the story is that it allows you to use several of the titan chassis from multiplayer without without having to swap out titans, keeping the focus squarely on BT and his relationship with Jack. At times, though, it seemed too convenient: BT is so knowledgeable and capable that at some points I had to wonder why this powerful and seemingly self-sufficient titan needs a pilot in the first place. He nearly always has the answer to any question Jack poses, points him in the right direction when they\u2019re separated, gives him orders and instructions toward the next objective, and explains what\u2019s happening no matter the heady sci-fi circumstance. Ultimately the relationship does find its footing as the two grow more dependant on each other, especially as the plot ramps up sharply in the third act\u2019s enjoyable climax. As both characters begin to buckle under the weight of their situation that relationship begins to take on new meaning, and it becomes one of Titanfall 2\u2019s highlights. Jack and BT's relationship becomes one of Titanfall 2\u2019s highlights. \u201c While I thoroughly enjoyed Titanfall 2\u2019s story, its secretive plot twists and character drama probably wouldn\u2019t sustain me on another playthrough alone. However, with four total difficulty settings (two more above the default \u2018normal\u2019 setting I experienced), combined with its welcomingly brisk runtime, I\u2019m definitely interested in going back to see if my mobility skills are enough to keep me alive with the odds stacked against me. And to hunt down those collectibles that are placed so tantalizingly out of reach.  Clash of the Titans But what does keep me coming back day after day \u2013 and likely will for some time to come \u2013 is Titanfall 2\u2019s slick and much more fleshed-out multiplayer modes. In our review of the original Titanfall, the biggest complaint was the lack of variety in modes, but this time around Respawn has learned from that mistake and built upon what it did right in its first game. Progression, customization, and content have all been ratcheted up, while elements that bogged down its balance have been trimmed down. As you\u2019d expect from a sequel, Titanfall 2\u2019s multiplayer is very much still the fast-paced, run, jump,  and gun action of the first game. The movement here feels great, and even when you\u2019re simply running back to the action after being killed there\u2019s a sense of engaging freedom. Knowing the best routes and stringing together jump after jump into wall-running and sliding to get across the map as quickly as possible is a minigame in and of itself. Though while this fast, fluid movement and twitchy gunplay is the centerpiece, multiplayer has evolved in a number of ways that let you put it to good use. The biggest change to multiplayer balance is, fittingly, to the titans themselves: they\u2019re much more vulnerable in Titanfall 2 because they don\u2019t come equipped with a regenerating shield. Every shot that connects damages the hull, so you can\u2019t simply fight and then back off to reset like a giant Call of Duty soldier. This both diminishes and greatly increases the value of titans: they\u2019re weaker on offense without support because a single on-foot player can eventually bring one down with hit-and-run tactics, but stronger when you work as a team to keep them up and running. \u201cRodeoing\u201d an enemy titan has also undergone an evolution that makes it a more dynamic game with a goal beyond simply destroying the enemy, and promotes teamwork in a new and interesting way. When you jump on an enemy titan\u2019s back you automatically pull out its glowing green battery, which damages its overall health. If you can escape with that battery in tow you can hop on a friendly titan and insert it to restore some health and grant a small overshield. From the perspective of the rodeoed titan\u2019s pilot, if your battery is pilfered and you can kill the enemy pilot holding it, you can hop out, grab it, and return it to your mech to regain some of that lost health. It\u2019s sort of a miniature version of capture the flag that takes place within every multiplayer game, and having to fight for those scraps in the heat of battle creates some great extra tension. The new fragility of titans isn\u2019t the only change in the name of balance. Burn Cards, those one-time-use perks you could activate any time during a match, are no more. They were neat in theory, but having multiple players pop free-titan cards at the start of the match shined a light on some balance issues around the system. In their place, that \"game changer\" element is replaced by Pilot Boosts, which are a perks, powers, or abilities that you equip before a match, and work toward unlocking it mid-game on the same meter you work toward calling in a titan. This makes the perks much more consistent, and activatable faster or slower in-game based on your performance, rather than just a freebie. And while they\u2019re all useful \u2013 like amping your weapon damage, calling in turrets or walking mines, and even the dreaded Smart Pistol \u2013 they\u2019re well balanced and not overpowered. Titan battles get another shot in the arm from increased variety of abilities. Where the original Titanfall has just three titan chassis to choose from (fast and weak, slow and strong, and somewhere in the middle) now six unique titans are available, each with distinct character. This class-based approach both adds variety and personality to each mech, and removes much of the guesswork when coming face to face with them. Spotting a nimble, sword-wielding Ronin class titan on the field tells me I need to keep my distance and pepper it from afar, whereas the seeing the Legion\u2019s devastating chaingun starting spinning up means I\u2019ll be better off dodging that bullet hose until it reloads so I can counterattack. That\u2019s a welcome layer of strategy and decision-making that comes into play when considering both your team composition and game mode. Different Strokes for Different Folks And there are a variety of modes in Titanfall 2, almost all of which offer an experience that\u2019s significantly different from the next. The marquee Attrition mode is back, pitting teams of eight against each other on a battlefield filled out by weak AI grunts that can be picked off for points. It\u2019s as good as ever, but it\u2019s overshadowed by the new AI-assisted mode, Bounty Hunt, where teams race to kill waves neutral grunts and titans while also fighting one another. A lot of extra tension comes from having to bank the cash you earn from kills before you\u2019re killed yourself during a small window between waves, because if another player takes you out they score half of your money. Thus, hoarding your money is a surefire way to lose the game, and being caught at the start of a wave without a titan all but giftwraps your wallet for the enemy team. So far it\u2019s my favorite way to experience Titanfall 2\u2019s online competitive action in my roughly 20 hours of play. Burn Cards, those one-time-use perks you could activate any time during a match, are no more. \u201c The remaining six straightforward game types are conventional enough for any first-person shooter fan to recognize. There\u2019s the classic team deathmatch and Free-For-All modes, along with the no-titans-allowed Pilots vs. Pilots, Last Titan Standing (where everyone starts with a mech and the first team to lose them all loses the match), and Amped Harpoint, which plays like a slower, campier form of domination where you\u2019re incentivized to stick by a capture node for increased point accrual. Of those, Amped Hardpoint is my favorite because it\u2019s a change of pace from the constant movement and hunting of most other modes, but all of them feel like they belong. Lastly, the Coliseum game mode drops you into a walled-off arena where you and another pilot duke it out with lasers and burst-weapon projectiles in a Quake-style exhibition match. But this mode requires you to buy a ticket with your in-game currency, or earn one through leveling, and rewards you with a variety of unlockable skins or currency for wins, it\u2019s lent an arcadey sense of risk-versus-reward gambling to progression. Leveling, Loot, and Longevity And Titanfall 2\u2019s multiplayer progression is an almost constant stream of experience and unlockables pouring into your profile, with relatively little time invested compared to other recent shooters. Rewards range in usefulness from new weapons and attachments, tactical and ordinance abilities, and titan modifiers to cosmetic enhancements: camo skins for weapons, pilots, and titans, plus banners and emblems earned by completing objectives and challenges used to decorate your player profile. And thankfully, you\u2019re not required to both unlock an item by leveling and then purchase it with currency \u2013 nearly all items can be purchased with currency regardless of level, the exception being weapon attachments which are only unlocked by leveling its specific weapon through use. In my multiplayer career I\u2019ve found that leveling up each individual weapon and titan alongside your overall pilot character imparts the feeling I\u2019m constantly working toward something. My hope is that at the same time Respawn is working toward something, specifically some additional maps. Though the current rotation is fine, good even, I haven\u2019t found one I really love yet. There are some I really do enjoy playing \u2013 Homestead comes to mind because of its wide open fields and four-story silo in the center \u2013 but I regularly I find myself wishing there were more avenues of approach that employed more of the pilot\u2019s jump kit capabilities rather than the crowded canyon walls or two-story standalone buildings. Respawn has promised a stream of free DLC without the need for a season pass, but it\u2019s unclear exactly what or how much is planned. Lastly, Titanfall 2\u2019s new Networks are social hubs that help keep players coordinated with bonus XP \u2013 called merits \u2013 up for grabs at specific times throughout the day. But largely they\u2019re a boon for people who want to play together, or play under a common banner \u2013 like IGN\u2019s network, which I encourage you to join \u2013 for the sake of socializing. This addresses another of our specific complaints from the first Titanfall, and it\u2019s a thoughtful addition that indicates that Respawn seems to have the happiness of Titanfall 2 playerbase foremost in mind when it comes to prolonging the life of its excellent multiplayer."

        "Content": "The original Valkyria Chronicles came out on the PlayStation 3 in 2008. Here\u2019s what we said about it in our original review :  \u201cValkyria Chronicles is a game that all PS3 owners should at least try out, especially considering its unique blend of genre forms. With such a robust collection of extras to back up an already impressive mission roster and gripping story, Valkyria Chronicles comes highly recommended. I strongly encourage you to try it out and see the beauty of Gallia and its people.\u201d  Valkyria Chronicles Remastered is a remaster done right. It\u2019s a great way to experience a truly brilliant tactical RPG, or an excuse to revisit a cult classic that has aged with grace and beauty. And while you\u2019ve likely encountered some of its themes in similar stories, Valkyria Chronicles\u2019 war tale is told with such charm and wit that it\u2019s hard not get wrapped up in Squad 7\u2019s adventures from the jump. It\u2019s BLiTZ! Valkyria Chronicles adds a nice twist to the turn-based strategy formula by allowing players to take direct control of individual units and move them on the map in third person. This system puts each encounter somewhere between traditional tactics and shooters, as you line up head-shots and subsequently run for cover, hopefully before your Action Points run out and you potentially find yourself stranded in enemy crossfire. Your squad-mates only get one action per turn, which makes for some painstaking decision-making in the face of relentless enemies. Do you heal now to prepare for a counter-attack or fire off one head-shot at the risk of immediate retaliation? It\u2019s a great way to experience a truly brilliant tactical RPG. \u201c There are dozens of these moments in every battle, and each is as nerve-racking as the one before it. It\u2019s a brilliant mechanic that encourages careful unit management, rewards precision, and keeps combat genuinely exciting from start to finish. This is particularly important, as you\u2019ll probably wind up playing more than a few of the game\u2019s encounters multiple times before achieving victory. The challenge here is rarely frustrating or repetitive, and while the learning curve is steep, it never feels unfair. Even when you find Squad 7 facing giant war-machines, fighting a seemingly insurmountable number of enemy troops, or crawling through the tall grass to avoid enemy spotlights, I found that if I took the time to prepare my troops and choose the right number in each class that victory was always within reach, even in the most daunting battles. All that tension led to a true feeling of accomplishment when all my smart decisions culminated in white-knuckled, down-to-the-last-man victories. Conversely, if you don\u2019t bring enough Lancers and Scouts to take out enemy tanks and shocktroopers, you can find yourself staring at a game over screen in a handful of turns. War Stories Outside of Valkyria Chronicles\u2019 battles, the rest of the game is mostly comprised of cutscenes. You can return to headquarters to reallocate troops, upgrade weapons and armor, and pay your respects to fallen soldiers, but the rest of the game is mainly comprised of cutscenes - loads and loads of cutscenes. Granted, the story told here is engaging and thoughtful, with a rich cast of compelling characters, even if the voice acting is occasionally hit or miss. It\u2019s the little touches that make the world of Valkyria Chronicles so captivating. \u201c Even the lowliest grunt on your squad has a backstory or interesting quirk that further compelled me to keep them alive. By the end, I found myself rooting for random scouts and snipers that I had taken with me onto the field and watched rise through the ranks. Each of these characters has innate buffs or weaknesses based on these backstories, and they even perform better when they\u2019re paired with troops they are pals with. For example, if your fight is in the desert, you want to take someone with an affinity for fighting in the sand and couple them with a friend to add an easy bonus to their attack or defense. It encourages mixing up your team and taking different troops to different locales. It\u2019s little touches like this that make the world of Valkyria Chronicles so captivating.  Valkyria Chronicles' art direction is easily one of its most impressive aspects, and now that it runs at 1080p and 60 frames-per-second, the Canvas engine that powers the gorgeous \u201csketchbook\u201d art style looks better than ever. It\u2019s surprising how well the visuals have stood the test of time, and even more impressive is how instantly recognizable they are here. Saying that Valkyria Chronicles is inspired by World War II is a bit of an understatement and the cel-shaded battle tanks and armor are lovingly rendered, lending a genuine believability to the game\u2019s alternate history motif.   Unfortunately, as far as re-releases go, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered delivers the bare minimum.  The original DLC missions and an Expert difficulty are also included, if you\u2019re a glutton for punishment. Outside of that there are no additional bells and whistles, which is a bit disappointing, but it doesn\u2019t tarnish the overall shine of the game itself."

From the early days of home console gaming with Jetpac, to the rise of the console shooter in Perfect Dark, all the way to a pair of Xbox 360 launch games, Rare Replay\u2019s breadth and depth is consistently impressive.  From the moment Rare Replay boots up, it\u2019s evident that this isn\u2019t just some haphazard collection of ROMs and emulators. The theatrical presentation, complete with a fantastic musical number and charming transitions, lend a playful sense of place and character to the collection. It\u2019s loaded with awesome extras, ranging from unused music and concept art, to fascinating documentaries on the making of classics like Conker and Killer Instinct, as well as some looks at some of Rare\u2019s unreleased games. There\u2019s a level of detail and quality here that we don\u2019t see often enough in compilations like these.   Of course, all of these great extras wouldn\u2019t amount to much if the games themselves weren\u2019t worth revisiting. Thankfully, a solid chunk of the 30 included hold up as great experiences, even in 2015. For example, the original Banjo-Kazooie still remains one of the best 3D platformers ever made. The characters are charming, the music is incredible, and the levels are some of the most varied, smartly designed stages the genre has ever seen. Plus, Rare Replay includes the XBLA version, meaning that its strong art direction gets the benefit of HD resolution.  Further back in time are lesser-known, but incredibly innovative games like Jetpac and Snake Rattle \u2018n\u2019 Roll. The former still provides a simple-yet-entertaining mix of an arcade shooter with resource management, while the latter is a strange isometric platformer that feels like what would\u2019ve happened if you gave Marble Madness a story.  Rare Replay also includes a handful of the studio\u2019s strangest, most unique experiments. Blast Corps, for instance is an insane action-puzzler where you have to destroy everything in the path of a nuclear warhead being driven through a variety of settings. If the nuke comes into contact with a single thing, the whole world explodes, lending a really great sense of tension to each stage.   On the complete opposite side of the tension scale are the two Viva Pinata games, which are about as calming as games can be. Clearing out your field, planting your garden, and watching colorful critters start to populate your world still feels just as good as it did back in 2006.  Then there are those that have failed to withstand the test of time. For every Banjo, there\u2019s a very boring Grabbed by the Ghoulies. For every influential console shooter like Perfect Dark, there\u2019s the hand-holding frustration of Perfect Dark Zero. But I appreciate that Rare Replay didn\u2019t go down the revisionist-history route by omitting its mistakes, and instead provide a real, honest portrait of the studio\u2019s work.  It\u2019s not quite a complete look, however, as some of the most famous games Rare has made aren\u2019t here due to legal issues. Nintendo\u2019s everlasting death grip on the Donkey Kong Country trilogy and Goldeneye 007 mean they won\u2019t likely ever appear on the Xbox One. Fortunately, the rest of Rare\u2019s work is great enough to stand up without those classics.   While most of the games in Rare Replay are presented as you might remember them from decades ago, there are some much-appreciated additions of modern convenience that made my trip back through the \u201880s and \u201890s much more tolerable than it would\u2019ve been if I\u2019d just dusted off an old NES and SNES. You\u2019re able to quickly use save and load states in any pre-Nintendo 64 game, which means you can slowly chip away at simplistic-yet-fun games like R.C. Pro-Am and Cobra Triangle without long trips back to save checkpoints after each death. Even better, the ability to freely rewind the action to any point in your last 10 seconds of play without any punishment means that the infamously hair-pulling Turbo Tunnel stage in Battletoads can now be completed by those of us who aren\u2019t terrifying video game savants.  Rare Replay also includes dozens of fun, self-contained minigames based on specific scenes in the pre-N64 games called Snapshots, which unfold a bit like those in NES Remix. Things like seeing how far you can get in an endless version of Turbo Tunnel, or trying to keep a civilian safe for 60 seconds in Cobra Triangle are bite-sized and addictive score-based challenges that doubles as a smart way of introducing you to the core mechanics of the lesser-known Rare games.

That definitely slows down the pace of popping in and out of games, as you would in an actual arcade. But what\u2019s worse is that there\u2019s some noticeable slowdown on a few of the more recent games, particularly Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, and it\u2019s sad that in those specific cases, poor performance makes this collector\u2019s version worse than the original experience."

The hours spent completing Journey will create memories that last for years.\u201d   Over three years after its original release, Journey on PlayStation 4 proves to be every bit as remarkable as it was when IGN awarded it Game of the Year for 2012. While the increase to 1080p and 60fps is definitely appreciated, what really shines here is the same concise, emotional, and gorgeous adventure that originally wowed us.  Developer Thatgamecompany took the beauty of Flow and the meditative gameplay of Flower, and added an immense sense of scale in its third and most impressive game. In the length of a standard movie, Journey is able to consistently make me feel emotion in a way that few games ever have.  At just over two hours long, Journey delivers an adventure that runs the gamut of human emotions. The awe that comes from cresting your first hill and spotting the mountain on the horizon is paired expertly with the fear that stems from exploring the ancient caverns beneath your destination. The playful curiosity of stumbling across a fellow traveler \u2013 another player having their own experience \u2013 and wordlessly cooperating with them to explore this world is only strengthened by the isolation and desperation that awaits near the mountain's frozen summit.

        "Title": "Broken Age: Act 2 Review",
        "Subtitle": "A fitting end",
        "Content": "Spoilers for Act 1 ahead. Head over here for our full Broken Age: Act 1 review.  Broken Age: Act 2 is a smart, fun, challenging cap to Double Fine\u2019s Kickstarted adventure. Still just as gorgeous and well-written, Act 2 is nearly twice as long as its predecessor. It ups the ante with surprising new characters, intriguing story reveals, and some really ingenious puzzles for the most part. There are a few nagging challenges along the way, but nothing that really detracts from the fantastic adventure at hand.   Picking up right at Act 1\u2019s phenomenal cliffhanger, a bulk of Act 2's charm is how it flips the first part\u2019s script on its head. I really enjoyed how the theme of role reversal seeps through nearly every moment of Act 2. Exploring a decrepit Mog Chothra as Vella, and meeting the citizens of Meriloft as Shay shine new light on the events of the first half of the game. Controlling both characters as they come to terms with the realizations that they\u2019ve been lied to for a bulk of their lives constantly provides hilarious, and often-times poignant moments. It's a well-written and surprisingly-mature story of growing up, dealing with the messes life throws at you, and ultimately coming out a better person.  That being said, I was a little bit disappointed that Act 2 takes place predominantly in the same locales as Act 1, albeit under very different circumstances. I loved revisiting folks and seeing how they've changed, such as Curtis giving up wood working in favor of becoming a metal smith, but I wished there had been more new characters and locations. Maybe I\u2019m just being greedy, but I loved discovering each new setting so much, and I wish Act 2 kept throwing those surprises at me.  Still, those settings are again populated with some of the most interesting characters in modern adventure games, and Broken Age shines because of their incredible interactions. Vella\u2019s rocky friendship with a violent, sentient knife is hilarious, and choosing which awful tree-puns Shay uses on a morose oak brings back fond memories of the insult sword fighting in the Monkey Island series. I found myself trying out every single item on every single character in the world, not because I thought it would help solve a puzzle, but because I just wanted to hear every fantastic line of dialogue.   But rest assured, the puzzles in Act 2 are mostly top-notch. It really plays with the dual-character setup by peppering puzzle solutions across both halves of the adventure. For example, spending some quality time with a snake as Shay is going to help you answer some strange questions as Vella. The puzzles in Act 2 are much larger, more complicated tasks, but most of the time that means the reward for solving them is that much sweeter. However, there are a handful of challenges with vague objectives that ultimately require oddly precise timing to accomplish. Early on in Vella\u2019s story, I found myself getting frustrated as I tried again and again to get the timing down on a puzzle where I had to swing a rope at a specific item.  A handful of bad apples aside, Broken Age: Act 2 doled out satisfying puzzles at a fantastic rate, and provided dozens of wonderful \u201caha!\u201d moments that separate great adventure games from the rest of the pack. Adding to this is the fact that most of the puzzles contain a plot or character element to them, meaning that every time you solve one, you flesh out a bit more of the world around you.

        "Content": "If I\u2019d never seen or heard of Homeworld or Homeworld 2 before playing The Homeworld Remastered Collection, and you told me they first came out in 1999 and 2003, I\u2019d probably have called you a liar. Even ignoring Remastered Collection\u2019s beautifully enhanced graphics, which would\u2019ve definitely fooled me into believing these were modern real-time strategy games, the way original developer Relic expertly pulls off a brilliant recreation of the Star Wars-scale space fleet battles is nothing short of amazing. Time has been very kind to both Homeworld\u2019s highly atmospheric story, and its design. It\u2019s fantastic that new developer Gearbox has updated these games for a new generation of strategy fans.  But of course I did play Homeworld in 1999, and a great many games since, yet these two 15-hour campaigns are still some of the best large-scale space battles I\u2019ve ever taken part in. The way fighters strafe and weave in combat is really impressive \u2013 they almost never have physics-breaking bumper-car collisions \u2013 and I adore watching individual turrets on larger ships track their targets. That breathtaking attention to detail, along with the newly refreshed models, textures, and effects highlight the creatively distinctive and often asymmetrical spaceship designs. A good-sized engagement of a few dozen ships is like a ballet mixed with a fireworks display of violent explosions, lighting up the already colorful nebula-tinged skyboxes like a laser show. Homeworld and Homeworld 2 definitely aren\u2019t simple games, but their complexity is the rewarding kind. Controlling fleets that can move freely in full-3D space is challenging to get the hang of, and it can be difficult to even figure out what\u2019s going on when two armadas of fighters, bombers, and corvettes are all swirling around in a giant furball of a dogfight around frigates, destroyers, battlecruisers, carriers, and the massive mothership itself. Getting used to tethering the free-floating camera to ships or objects in the area you\u2019re interested in is the equivalent of finding your sea legs when you\u2019re accustomed to having solid ground under your feet. Homeworld\u2019s interface does a good job of helping you wrangle your forces, though, especially now that many of Homeworld 2\u2019s improvements have been retrofitted to the original. Zooming out to a tactical view of the area and giving orders to control groups makes things manageable, and double-clicking to select every unit of a type lets you take command of fast-moving and scattered ships. The toughest trick is giving orders to travel to a specific point in space - you have to give a move order, then hold Shift to adjust the altitude, and you have to constantly shift the camera around to get a sense of depth. Admirably, the interface does all of this without getting in the way of the action - even the build and research menus are mostly kept collapsed and out of sight. Subtle improvements, like the elimination of the need to refuel fighters and corvettes periodically, makes moment-to-moment gameplay move a little smoother than it originally did. 6 Images  Actually, the full-3D navigation is rarely used in missions, as most of the action takes place on a 2D plane. I find the ability to send your ships up and down the Z-axis is more essential to Homeworld\u2019s imposing sense of scale than its mission design or fleet tactics \u2013 the vastness of space becomes clear when you realize these maps are as large vertically as they are horizontally. A side effect of the huge maps is that there\u2019s quite a bit of downtime, and a slow pace in general as huge, plodding starships make their way from one side to the other. That deliberate movement has the advantage of keeping things from becoming overwhelming during the heat of battle; even though I\u2019m managing dozens of ships at once, I rarely worry I\u2019ll miss something crucial. Waiting for resource harvesters to drain asteroids of their mineral treasures is quite tedious at times, though. A rock-paper-scissors balancing system makes it fairly easy to determine what ships you should send to counter the enemy, though you usually have options. You could stop an incoming wave of enemy interceptors with interceptors of your own, or multi-gun corvettes, or activate a Gravity Well Generator to disable them completely so that your Assault Frigates can pick them off. The big-picture strategy is to make sure you have ships in range to respond to new threats before it\u2019s too late, which leads to some tense juggling and risk-taking.  There are some great missions in the first 15-hour campaign: challenges like fending off swarms of drone ships in a dense nebula, reacting to surprise attacks, defending allies, and capturing enemies keep the goals varied. The stakes of battle are raised considerably by the fact that your fleet is persistent from mission to mission, meaning that if you lose a destroyer in battle, you might have a tougher time getting through the next mission. It\u2019s generally good at scaling the threat to match what you\u2019ve brought with you, though you might have to load a previous mission\u2019s auto-save to get back to that tough spot with more firepower and resources in the bank. A few missions don\u2019t hold up \u2013 clearing a wave of asteroids headed for your stationary mothership is a tedious exercise after blasting the first couple of rocks. Another mission forces you to guide your ships through a dust cloud to shield them from radiation; in the original, the dust particles were easy to spot; in Remastered, they\u2019re one-pixel dots and frustratingly difficult to follow. Those are more than worth tolerating, because Homeworld tells a fantastic, emotional story \u2013 something very few real-time strategy games have done. With nothing but spaceship models, artful use of the cinematic camera, awe-inspiring classical music, and some excellent parallax animations and voiceovers, Relic created a convincing tale of a people fleeing genocide and setting out in a desperate search of their ancestral home. This game has gravitas.  Transitioning from Homeworld to Homeworld 2 is an interesting mix of tradeoffs. Like in the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Homeworld\u2019s story is an emotional story of desperate survival, and as powerful today as it was 15 years ago. Like the third and fourth seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Homeworld 2 loses sight of what made it special and turns to less relatable themes like playing out mystic prophecy and cliches of reuniting ancient artifacts. To be fair, Homeworld is a tough act to follow, but it\u2019s still a bit of a let down in that department. On the other hand, mission design is significantly improved in the similarly lengthy sequel, with no memorably annoying scenarios and plenty of great battles, some of which feature outrageously powerful ships. Homeworld 2 notably makes a big jump forward in control by shifting from Homeworld\u2019s individually built small ships to treating whole squadrons as a single unit, which removed much of the busywork from maintaining a large, spectacular fleet. It\u2019s too bad that story mojo runs out in the second game, because Relic learned so much from the first campaign in regards to mission design and pacing that Homeworld 2 is significantly more fun to play.

Gearbox says too much of the source materials from that game has been lost or misplaced to give it the full remastering treatment for now. It\u2019s a shame Gearbox couldn\u2019t take the Beta label off of the multiplayer modes before The Remastered Collection went on sale, so it should be approached with skepticism with regards to its balance and stability. However, it\u2019s great that the it offers the ability to play as any of the four different factions from across both games. This means you can set up a scenario where you play as the Kushan from the original Homeworld against Homeworld 2\u2019s Hiigarans (the same people), or match the first game\u2019s Taiidan empire against the second game\u2019s invading Vaygr. Not that any of the sides is radically different in a mechanical sense, but the subtleties of each, such as the Kushan\u2019s Stealth Fighter and Drone Frigate, give the options some variety. It\u2019s here that the research system that seems so superfluous in the single-player game (because techs are unlocked one or two at a time) actually matters, and allows for some crucial decisions for what type of fleet you\u2019ll build. Homeworld will likely never be a competitive RTS due to its slow pace, but skirmishing against the AI or other space battle fans won\u2019t get old anytime soon. It also features a great fleet painter, which lets you splash your ships with pink and purple if you so chose. On the technical side, I\u2019ve experienced great performance on my GeForce GTX 970, and only one crash in more than 40 hours of play. The one significant issue has been that running in full screen mode has caused a strange problem where the cursor is constrained to roughly 75 percent of the screen area, unable to reach the bottom or right sides. (Windowed mode works fine.) For some reason, this occurred on two of three computers tested, and Gearbox\u2019s team says this is the first they\u2019ve heard of it. Much as I appreciate the inclusion of the original, untouched versions of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as extras in The Remastered Collection, some slight updating would\u2019ve been nice - for example, making them support 16:9 resolutions without having to go in and tweak .ini files. But they do run, if only barely. Trying to run Homeworld Classic at above 640x480 caused text to become illegible. But this is the only way to experience fun but goofy features ability to play through the Homeworld campaign as the Taiidan instead of the Kushan."

In The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a rare balance is struck where its brutal bullet-hell difficulty isn\u2019t a punishment, but an opportunity to see something totally new. Because of excellent randomization and seemingly endless content, I\u2019m still seeing items, bosses, and entirely new types of dungeons even after 30 hours of intense twin-stick shooter-style battle. And, every so often, I pause for a moment and appreciate that I\u2019m playing as a traumatized, naked child who\u2019s destroying poop monsters and zombie babies by crying on them because his crazy mother tried to kill him. So it\u2019s something we can all relate to. While its randomized maps and collectable hearts, keys, and bombs resemble the dungeons of the original Legend of Zelda, the skills involved in surviving here are more about mastering your tear projectiles, which are are affected by your momentum at the moment you fire them. That enables a surprising depth in trick shots that can be launched further than their inherent range or curve off their natural four-directional path. However, because of the perspective, it can be hard to hit flying enemies, or large ones, due to shots passing behind their sprites when they appear to be on target. One of the best things about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is that every time I play, Isaac ends up looking and behaving radically differently \u2013 usually within a few moments of starting a run. He begins as a strangely adorable big-headed pink child with teary eyes that launch projectiles at enemies with typical twin-stick shooter controls, but picking up an item from behind a golden door can enhance his powers while disfiguring him in one of a hundred different horrible ways. One time you might pick up an item that turns him into a cyclops that fires huge mega-tears, and the next you\u2019ll find a powerup that\u2019ll embed a meteorite in his head and cause his tears to orbit around him. Even better, if you find one and then the other, Isaac will become a cyclops with a meteorite embedded in his head, with giant, powerful tears orbiting him and obliterating any flies or spiders or bloated corpse-babies nearby. Those continue to stack as you move from dungeon to dungeon, which sometimes allows you to become wildly overpowered - and yet still vulnerable to an unforeseen enemy type or stepping on spikes. You lose everything when you die, so the stakes rise with every promising new discovery. It keeps you guessing and adapting to new powers and challenges, all the while rewarding you with a huge variety of creepy-cute artwork. 34 Images What\u2019s a bit annoying is how little information The Binding of Isaac gives you when you discover one of its hundreds of pickups. For example, when I pick up a piece of petrified poop, \u201cIt feels lucky?\u201d flashes across the screen, but if I hadn\u2019t looked up what it does exactly on an external wiki, I might never have figured out its exact function. I\u2019m a big fan of the process of experimenting and discovering those abilities on my own, but some kind of built-in mechanism for remembering what they do would\u2019ve been a big help, considering that in my hundreds of playthroughs there have been multiple items I\u2019ve still only seen once, and new ones are still being unlocked all the time.

Warlords of Draenor takes that same approach. Blizzard's resilient MMORPG may be 10 years old this year, but it keeps you anchored to the latest content like no other expansion before it. Blizzard wants you to keep your attention on Draenor, and it's easy to see why. While elements of the expansion overemphasize single-player play a tad, the core experience of playing the reigning MMO king has never been so enjoyable.  With this expansion, WoW places virtually all services in the new faction hubs of Stormshield and Warspear, circumventing the need to cavort about decade-old assets to toss an item on the auction house. It allows you to engage in expansion-specific profession tasks regardless of your skill level. It even allows a free boost to level 90 for anyone who buys the expansion. Thanks to new character models and other updates, WoW hardly looks its age until you move beyond the borders of the old world and into the new content.  Orcs & Humans  It's also Warcraft at its purest. Warlords of Draenor may come packaged in a silly time-travel story focusing on Garrosh Hellscream's attempt to hook up with dear ol' dad for Azerothian invasion fun, but at heart it's a story about the necessity of killing a bunch of orcs. And they're cool orcs, too. Blizzard killed off most of its good villains long ago, but this time-hopping tale to the orcish homeworld of Draenor before the events of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans started allows us to face them all again.  For 20-year veterans of Warcraft like me, it's brimming with nostalgia. There's Ner'zhul, the orc who merged with Arthas to become the Lich King! There's Grom Hellscream, still as much of a punk as ever! Blizzard introduces these guys and a bunch of other, well, warlords of Draenor so quickly in an hour-long instanced segment that it's surely hard to keep track of them all if you're new, but it rarely matters. They look cool, the cutscenes establish their personalities within seconds, and they're fun to fight. If the simplistic story stumbles, it's only in that Blizzard seems to take too many cues from Game of Thrones by killing so many key characters off along the leveling trail just as we've come to love them all over again.  But the surrounding world of Draenor itself is just as compelling a character. It's beautiful, for one, and as with the rest of the WoW, it's populated with snazzy new character models for almost every race. The world itself is technically the same one we already saw in 2007's The Burning Crusade expansion, but setting Warlords before its destruction allows it to assume a different look entirely. The old fan-favorite zone of Nagrand largely remains intact, but here we find grassy, moonlit meadows in place of the barren wastes of 2007's Shadowmoon Valley, and the formerly ruined dome of Auchindoun is restored to splendor. Warlords of Draenor sees Blizzard return to the aesthetic heights it reached in Mists of Pandaria, but here the focus on orcish encampments and savage surroundings appeals to the most primal elements of the Warcraft experience.  It's an environment you'll almost always experience on foot or hoof. Blizzard took the big step of removing flying mounts entirely for Warlords of Draenor, and while the inability to cross a mountain range just by flying over it sometimes stings, the journey is better for it. The shift restores the focus on exploration that\u2019s been lost since the original game, when it was necessary to look around for new pathways to ascend lonely peaks and find seemingly inaccessible treasures. It adds a welcome touch of adventure to the act of hunting down quest enemies, as you need to navigate through dozens of his or her buddies instead of just swooping down a bashing them in the head. At eye level, Draenor feels more like a world we're living in, rather than a topographic map.  But as lovely as the world may be, it's the revised questing structure that gives it strength. You'll still find the basic quests that require you to kill 10 of this or pick up five of that, but they're woven deftly into a world that's brimming with \"rare\" enemies dropping superior loot and bonus objectives outside the main story that drop bucketloads of XP. Well-integrated actiony cutscenes push the pace along as well as any single-player RPG, and a new chance of winning loot upgrades with every quest turn-in adds a dose of excitement to this most basic of MMO tasks. Little treasures now dot the countryside, allowing humorous insights into Warcraft's lore or the chance of godly loot well below the level cap. Most notably of all, Warlords lets you choose one of two outposts that grant bonuses for each zone, thereby customizing your experience and imbuing the landscape with choice and an additional layer of individuality. In Nagrand, for instance, you might engage in neverending mounted combat astride a fleet-footed talbuk, or you could choose to steamroll through the enemies in your very own tank.  Mr. Garrison  All of the associated quests emphasize that the story here is all about you. You're not just some adventurer; you're the \"commander\" \u2013 the slayer of the Lich King and the bane of the dragon Deathwing \u2013 and NPCs salute you and murmur admiringly about your exploits as you strut past. This philosophy comes to a head in the Warlords of Draenor's new Garrisons, where you can build and expand your own little city in the corners of each faction's Draenor starting zone. As with the outposts, the main garrison is all about letting you customize your playstyle as you wish, and it affects almost all levels of gameplay. Want new mounts and immunity to being dazed while mounted? Build and upgrade your stables. Want your own access to a both personal and guild banks and an auction house? Build and upgrade your trading post. And my personal favorite: Want more chances to get upgrades from quest loot? Toss up a Dwarven bunker.   Across three tiers, garrisons evolve in much the same way that bases did in the old Warcraft strategy games, morphing from ramshackle fortifications to full-on castles with stone walls and spires. But there's more than a little touch of Facebook social games here: you log in every day, harvesting the convenient herbing and mining nodes (regardless of whether you're an herbalist or a miner), and you send off various followers you've recruited through your questing to bring back resources and gold. Games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood already pioneered similar concepts, but in true Blizzard fashion, Warlords of Draenor takes the idea and makes it more fun by including brief little animations showing the outcome of their off-screen ventures and by letting them hang around your garrison to chew the fat. It's addicting fun in the same way that social games can be fun if they get their hooks in you. (And like social games, garrisons can be disastrously expensive if you're not prepared. I've already pumped around 17,000 gold into my own, and I'm nowhere near finished.)  I worry, though, that garrisons focus too heavily on the single-player aspect, to the detriment of World of Warcraft's community. Garrisons pull key services such as banks, herbs, mining nodes, stables, vendors, and even auction houses into a single-player instance, thereby minimizing the need to even go out into the world and interact with other people. And the strengths of those interactions (barring the omnipresent racist and spiteful spew in general chat) has always been one of the factors in keeping WoW above its ambitious competitors. Many of us come back to WoW at least partly because that's where our friends are, and garrisons potentially reduce the chances to make more friends.  Reach Out and Touch Someone  That said, the traditional avenues for hobnobbing with other players remain, whether it's in the dungeons, raiding guilds, or on the new 100-on-100 player-versus-player battlespace of Ashran. Blizzard's removal of flying for Draenor has also had the happy effect of making random conversations with nearby players more common than they were in the time of Cataclysm of Pandaria, as we now have to work together to find paths to objectives or take down tough rare enemies in Nagrand for reputation items.

The excitement of the leveling experience dwindles a tad at the level cap, although this should be temporary. The first raid for Warlords of Draenor (due December 2) hasn't been released yet, and thus much of the currently PvE endgame centers on obnoxiously grindy daily quests for the apexis crystals that'll be used as currency for better loot. On the bright side, players are figuring out that they can get Apexis quests done faster if they work in a group, thus providing a welcome counterpoint to the dicey though enjoyable single-player focus of the garrisons.  Elsewhere, the new PvP zone of Ashran strikes me as little more than a melee-hostile, zergy tug-of-war arena between Horde and Alliance (and thus establishes itself as one of Warlords' few weak points), but it provides some fun partly though the ability to summon big bosses in the style of the old days of Alterac Valley. I've always been a lover of World of Warcraft's dungeons, and I'm pleased to report that they remain in top form here despite a poor introduction from the yawn-inducing Bloodmaul Slag Mines at level 90 or so. They're not terribly hard even on their heroic modes (and even that challenge will likely dissipate once more players get geared), but they're fun, as exemplified by the banter of the foremen in the Iron Docks or the entirety of Grimrail Depot, which follows your adventures as you hijack a moving train. If the raids prove as entertaining, Warlords of Draenor could easily end up going down in history as World of Warcraft's best overall expansion, and there's no better way to celebrate its 10-year anniversary.  Of course, Warlords of Draenor hasn't exactly been the smoothest of World of Warcraft's launches, and I once spent over eight hours in a queue before getting in. Thankfully, after several emergency maintenance periods and server restarts, the trouble on that front appears to be over \u2013 and Blizzard has compensated everyone with five days of free subscription time."

        "id": "9a3cba9a549fc8f7f4f0ebc0e3253093",
        "Content": "The Halo series has the historic distinction of inspiring millions of gamers to spend hundreds of dollars on new consoles just to play it. The Master Chief Collection \u2013 which includes all four numbered entries in the series \u2013 is a great reminder that Halo succeeded not because of hype or flavor-of-the-month popularity, but because of timeless first-person shooter design. With excellent stories, sandbox battlefields, and great AI, everything holds up against modern shooters, many of which owe a huge debt to Halo\u2019s inspiration. It\u2019s all presented beautifully, with remade graphics and sound that allow old hands like me to relive the glory days through rose-tinted glasses, and new fans to appreciate the classics without having to look past decade-plus-old graphics. However, Halo\u2019s memorable multiplayer modes are undermined by unacceptably unreliable and bug-ridden performance in the days after launch, to the point where I can\u2019t recommend that you buy Master Chief Collection right now for that functionality. That\u2019s heartbreaking, but on the bright side there\u2019s still more than enough single-player and co-op content here to strongly recommend it for those alone. The fan service begins right at the main menu: a flick of the thumbstick starts playing the soundtrack of the selected game. It\u2019s a laudable touch, considering how big a part Halo\u2019s musical scores have played in establishing the series\u2019 memorable atmosphere. I jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014\u2019s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges \u2013 I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they\u2019re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don\u2019t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s parts \u2013 most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second \u2013 trumps its minor annoyances. I\u2019m giving the audio a standing ovation. Halo 2\u2019s already-great soundtrack has been remastered, and sounds bigger and fuller while remaining reverential and respectful to the original. It\u2019s so good I\u2019d listen to it in my car. Meanwhile, Chief\u2019s chunky metallic footsteps have been added, and every weapon sound has been replaced with beefier, more aggressive versions. The new Battle Rifle and sniper rifle in particular pack a satisfying wallop, but I could\u2019ve done without the more musical Covenant energy sword and overcharged plasma pistol effect. It sounds like the Jetsons\u2019 car floating by. You can appreciate the contrast easily, because the audio, like the visuals, also cycles between the 2004 original versions and the 2014 remastering along with the graphics. And you know what? Halo 2 remains a damn fine game, especially now that you can jump straight into Halo 3 and minimize the whiplash of that hard-stop of an ending. Bombastic set pieces like the battle on the Scarab, the Scorpion tank trek across the bridge, and the Banshee run near the end all mix with a plot that ably weaves the parallel stories of Master Chief and the Arbiter. Phenomenal new cutscenes not only breathe new life into the plot, but make me long for a feature-length CG Halo film. The best example is the stunning Gravemind scene. What was an unintentionally hilarious conversation with a featureless brown worm is now a dramatic confrontation with the hideous amalgamation of all Flood parasites, rendered here in disgusting detail. Buy 1, Get 3 Free The other three included Halo games all run at 60fps too, but all suffer from the same noticeable, but far from crippling framerate dips. That doubled speed gives the campaigns and multiplayer modes alike a newfound smoothness and polished feel. All but Halo 2 run at 1080p, which still looks good at the slightly lower resolution of 1328 by 1080. There\u2019s no going back from this smoother framerate: the Master Chief Collection is the definitive version of each of these games. It\u2019s great to see the lost art of local split-screen co-op multiplayer revived here, in all four games. It\u2019s now much more playable, thanks to splitting 1080 lines of resolution between players instead of just 320, and on much larger TVs than were common a decade ago. Don\u2019t expect to maintain 60 frames per second in split-screen, though \u2013 the dips are far more frequent this way. Master Chief Collection\u2019s version of Combat Evolved is based off of 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. It can\u2019t match up to Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s Xbox One-ified upgrade, but it\u2019s a whole lot better than dusting off your 2001 Xbox to replay this still-great game. Some things, like Chief\u2019s relatively short jump height and inability to board vehicles, feel a bit archaic now. But the original Halo\u2019s excellent story and still-remarkable large-scale combat sandboxes \u2013 not to mention the goosebump-inducing chanting-monks theme \u2013 make the first Halo both enjoyable and relevant in 2014. Halo 3 is probably the relative low point in the looks department. It has neither the benefit of Halo CE or Halo 2\u2019s recent coat of Anniversary paint, nor of being fairly new like Halo 4. The resolution and framerate boosts do give it a nice, clean look, at least. And with the exception of that exacerbating \u201cCortana\u201d mission, it remains arguably the series\u2019 finest start-to-finish campaign, complete with an ending that retains all of its emotional punch. As for Halo 4, its stunning visuals are Master Chief Collection\u2019s most pleasant surprise. What was already a high point for graphics on Xbox 360 legitimately looks like it was made for Xbox One when running at 1080p and 60fps. Its sound design remains the best in the series, too, aside from the Battle Rifle. I wish it\u2019d gotten the same sound thunderous effect as Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s version, because now it sounds like a child\u2019s toy by comparison. Master Chief Collection also offers Campaign Playlists, a clever way to take advantage the fact that all four Master Chief adventures are under the same roof. Whether you\u2019re playing the last levels of each campaign back-to-back or consecutively tackling every tank mission on the disc, they\u2019re a clever addition \u2013 particularly in local or online co-op. Multiplayer Tragically, online functionality has been extremely messy in the days following Master Chief Collection\u2019s launch. I\u2019ve seen everything from extended matchmaking wait times to being dumped into a seemingly random map and gametype option that wasn\u2019t voted for. Additionally, crashes to desktop, freezes, parties being split up into separate teams, uneven team pairings, and custom-game oddities like mixing up the teams when time you come out of a match mean that, for the time being, you have to wrestle with Master Chief Collection just to play it online. It\u2019s a true shame that, for now, Halo 2 was easier to play with your friends a decade ago than it is today on exponentially more powerful hardware and a more robust Xbox Live. When it works like it\u2019s supposed to, as it did at a pre-release review event and hopefully will for everyone one day soon, Master Chief Collection\u2019s massive multiplayer suite makes me happy. That\u2019s primarily because it gives me two things I\u2019ve waited years for: the ability to play Halo 2 on Xbox Live again and the chance to play the original Halo\u2019s groundbreaking multiplayer online (which even Halo CE Anniversary spectacularly failed to give). It\u2019s here, and on dedicated servers, no less (in matchmaking; custom games are peer-to-peer, as they always were), with the multiplayer modes of Halo 3 and 4 thrown in for good measure.

Running around Blood Gulch, Hang \u2018em High, or Sidewinder and three-shotting my friends with Halo CE\u2019s lethal default pistol is nostalgically satisfying, but Halo 2 made such a leap in terms of gameplay and features that it makes Halo CE feel its age more than the others. Perhaps Halo 2\u2019s greatest accomplishment is its incredible complement of maps, many of which remain classics. Swords-only on Lockout, 1-Flag CTF on Zanzibar, anything on Midship, \u2013 Halo 2 packs 25 maps, and 90 percent of them are gems. And long-gone but not forgotten gametypes like Fiesta are lovingly resurfaced, as are the deep customization options. For instance, I resurrected an old Coagulation map variant I created 10 years ago called Covie Gulch, which replaces the Scorpion tank with the Wraith and the Warthog with the long-absent Spectre. It\u2019s all back, with the small but annoying exceptions of no longer being able to transfer party leadership to another person in your group and the presence of open-channel voice chat instead of Halo 2\u2019s useful proximity/push-to-open-a-channel combo. Elsewhere, there are six Halo 2 Anniversary maps \u2013 a separate group of remakes on top of the complete original complement of Halo 2 battlegrounds \u2013 and they deserve special mention. These half-dozen built-for-Xbox One stages are, quite literally, modern takes on some of Halo 2\u2019s best maps. They dutifully recreate the exact, welcome feel of Halo 2 in addition to the look. In fact, while it\u2019s hard to complain about content when there\u2019s so much of it, the six Anniversary maps are so beautiful and fun that I really wish there were more of them \u2013 particularly since they have their own matchmaking playlist on Xbox Live . Halo 3 and 4, meanwhile, also return exactly as you remember them. For all the benefit of having every Halo multiplayer here, the downside is that it really is jarring to jump from game to game in consecutive multiplayer matches. A universal control scheme option mitigates this somewhat, but that doesn\u2019t account for the mental and physical adjustments you have to make for the differences in jump heights, physics, weapons, etc. between each. The Battle Rifle appears in Halos 2, 3, and 4 for instance, but it is its own unique animal in each. Finally, in the context of multiplayer, the game-unifying interface is mostly successful in helping to easily parse through so many choices. I appreciate how you can press a button to go straight back to the top menu, rather than have to repeatedly B-button your way back, step by step, if you want to go do something else. One complaint, though: it oddly fails to show you a preview of your Spartan or Elite multiplayer avatar after you build it in the very same interface."

        "Content": "Sunset Overdrive has ruined my attention span, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. During my 30-hour trip through developer Insomniac's insane but endearing depiction of the apocalypse, I strayed off the beaten path more than I have in any other open-world game in recent memory. Despite the mini-map encouraging me to head 400 meters east, I couldn't help but veer off the route at every opportunity.  This isn't due to a lack of interesting things to do, but rather a testament to the abundance of them. Because of Sunset's superb traversal, impeccable comedic writing, and wealth of upgrade paths for my character and weapons, I was more than happy to take the road less traveled. More often than not, it led me someplace that I'm thoroughly glad I visited.  Sunset Overdrive visually pops, like the Easter Bunny on an acid trip. Its bright colors, punk-rock attitude, and nose turned up in the direction of authority all meld together wonderfully. Like the cult-classic Jet Set Radio, Sunset assaulted my senses with a never-ending barrage of stimulus. Monsters explode into an ocean of bright-orange viscera, certain weapons allow you fire off a torrent of blazing fireworks, and freezing enemies will result in the word \u201cBRRRR\u201d appearing in the air above them. I really appreciate that Insomniac has crafted a world that successfully adheres to a strong, unique, and artistic vision.  This distinct style transcends aesthetics, and actually aids in Sunset's most successful and often-used mechanics. Like most any open-world game, the mission structure here has you talking to a character at point A, making your way across the map to point B, and engaging in some activity that usually results in being sent to collect a reward at point C. While that structure might sound monotonous, Sunset makes the very act of traversal a constant joy instead of an obligatory trudge. I rarely found myself using the fast travel system, because this is a game that\u2019s about the journey as much as the destination.  Narrative conceit be damned, your hero or heroine can, using nothing but their own two feet, bounce off anything remotely buoyant, dash through the air, and grind on all manners of power lines, billboards, and anything that presents a right angle -- now all I want is for Insomniac to make a Spider-Man game. In fact all of this is encouraged thanks to a punitively slow regular ground running speed, the rewards of a smart combo system, and an ridiculous abundance of monsters, soldiers, and robots. Seriously, if you find yourself on the ground for more than 10 seconds, deprived of your godly mobility, chances are you\u2019re going to end up dead shortly after that. But Sunset wisely avoids harsh punishments with quick respawns with amusing animations that lovingly pay homage - in clever ways - to dozens of classic works, from Portal to Terminator to Night of the Living Dead.  As long as you keep moving and refrain from lingering on the ground, Sunset\u2019s combat proves to be deep, entertaining, and rewarding. I loved fighting enemies like the giant Hurkers, as each encounter felt like a mini-boss fight in and of itself. There\u2019s a great sense of tension in trying to stay moving while maintaining the high ground. And thanks to Sunset\u2019s deep and varied arsenal, I found myself creating some really interesting combos: I\u2019d start off by peppering the area with freeze bombs, which bought me enough time to lay down a field of Acid Sprinklers, and finish it all off with a cascade of exploding teddy bears.   While all of that looks and feels awesome in motion, it definitely isn\u2019t easy. The controls in Sunset aren't simple: by the time you gain a full suite of weapons and traversal abilities, your hands will be getting a serious workout trying to manage them all. But while it certainly felt cumbersome initially, leading to a stretch of hours where my fingers always felt just a fraction of a second behind where my mind was, I eventually acclimated to the complex system and even grew to appreciate it.  For sure, by the end of the campaign, I still found myself having to work to navigate this hand-eye-coordination spaghetti bowl when I had to grind on a wire, kill a horde of monsters below me, hop off, switch weapons and kill an airborne bat-thingy, and air dash towards the nearest bounding so I could wall-ride around its outside. But while it might be a bit complicated, the result of mastering the system and eventually being able to make it across the entirety of the city without ever setting foot on the pavement is wildly satisfying.  That prior example of insanity is just one of hundreds that I remember fondly. I love telling other people my stories about my time in Sunset Overdrive, because they seem to be just that: my stories. If I wanted to put on a wolf mask and fire off explosive teddy bears at a group of robots, I could do just that. Sunset treats its open world as a canvas for you to express yourself aesthetically, through movement, and of course, through combat.   It also felt personalized by the fact that weapons and abilities are upgraded based on how often you use them. The more I bounced across the city, the more opportunities I had to add an explosion to my jumps. Everytime I killed a robot with an Acid Sprinkler, I inched closer to upgrading both my weapon, as well as my skills against robots. Not only does it reward your playstyle, but it also encouraged me to experiment with other weapons in order to see how they\u2019d evolve over time.  Combat reaches new levels of insanity when you hop into Chaos Squad, Sunset Overdrive\u2019s eight-player cooperative multiplayer missions. These unfold as wave-based siege defenses where you\u2019re given a brief amount of time to lay traps and coordinate with your buddies before all hell breaks loose. The ensuing spectacle of blood, guts, lightning, ice, lasers, and giant fireworks is insanity of the highest caliber. But while Chaos Squad is a neat diversion, it didn\u2019t grab me quite as tightly as the single-player campaign managed to.

        "Content": "Some RPGs make you feel godly by battling big bosses or making heady choices. In Divinity: Original Sin, it's about discovering how you affect the world. I realized the power at my disposal when I used my mage's rain spell to douse the flames afflicting a boat in the starting town of Cyseal. Piff, down went the flames and up went the cheering arms of the rescued sailors. No yellow question marks or blathering NPCs bid me do it; it simply seemed like a good idea at the time. And praise the sun, it was. That's the kind of rewarding experimentation that lies at the heart of Divinity: Original Sin. Discovering how its many complex pieces interact with each other and how its complex and amazing spell system can be used to your advantage is what keeps it going for the majority of its outstanding 60-ish hours of questing. Despite the name, originality in the fundamental style of roleplaying gameplay doesn\u2019t appear to have been a priority here; developer Larian Studios seems to have concerned itself more with skillfully stoking the flames of nostalgia. Divinity: Original Sin is the kind of game I briefly expected to play when I heard Overhaul Games was making an enhanced version of Baldur's Gate a couple of years back, as it coats the same type of experience that got me hooked on the digital incarnations of Gary Gygax's Dungeons & Dragons legacy with rich, modern graphics and contemporary relevance. It's all here, from the top-down perspective as you follow four adventurers from above like Warhammer pieces on a tabletop, to turn-based combat and the clunky menus that seemingly require more skill that it takes to wield a sword. As someone with fond memories of those RPGs, that alone would make Original Sin an eyecatching game. Fortunately, it's more than that. Take the overarching story of two \"Source hunters\" tracking down the dastardly fiends who dabble in \"Sourcery.\" (I know Terry Pratchett was using the term way back during the heydey of Super Mario Bros. 3, but it still sounds like one of the more forced attempts to wring some freshness of out the terminology of conventional high fantasy.) Much as in big-budget roleplaying peers such as Skyrim or Mass Effect , the overarching plot revolving around (of course) saving the world never entirely smothers the experience of side activities, and you'll even find the occasional joke worming its way into the heady stuff. It's a safe route that perhaps escapes the demands of living up to the storytelling quality of a game like Planescape: Torment , but Original Sin's writers are competent enough to make the direction work well. Much of the appeal of Original Sin's scattered quests stems from the way Larian peppers them with humor and subtle pop-culture references, along with little tidbits of conflict with NPCs sprinkled into the responses for the text-based pop-up responses to quests. These conflicts are almost always resolved with a virtual game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and they provide a welcome diversion when the two main characters are allowed to bicker over the merits of their actions in a key quest (particularly when you're in charge of controlling both of them). Sometimes these little spats give stat boosts or disposition gains, but they're most effective in the online cooperative mode as a means of injecting some roleplay into the experience aside from the combat  and swapping items between the two heroes. Quests themselves are well-written adventures dealing with conflicts like ancient blood feuds and racial tensions. Do you, for example, help an elf whose family was murdered by orcs kill an innocent descendent of the vicious orc tribe, try to talk him out of it, or fool him into leaving by either faking the orc\u2019s death or stealing an amulet as proof you killed her? Divinity: Original Sin\u2019s quests are full of these kinds of great moral choices, and most of them have two or more possible outcomes that really made me feel like I had control over the fate of the characters. Combat is where Divinity: Original Sin shakes off its mantle of tradition and comes into its own. There's a faint echo of Magicka in its heavily use of various spell and elemental combinations for devastating effects, but Larian distinguishes itself by working that system into almost every moment of combat to create opportunities for crowd control and environmental advantages that demand some brainwork even on the easiest of the three difficulty modes. My trick with the rain merely showed that system at its simplest; future encounters rarely let you get off so easily. You might have to dispel a poison cloud with a flame spell, then drench the flames with another blast of the rain spell to clear the way. Sometimes plans can backfire, such as when I discovered that I'd accidentally thrown a shock spell at an enemy who was standing in a puddle that extended under my own feet. Oops. And get this: all the enemies can use these same spell combinations against you. It's a clever tactical dynamic that manages to keep every encounter fresh and memorable, even after many hours. I did have a rough time figuring the combat system out over the first 10 hours of play, to say nothing of other unexpected tricks such as using a spell to burn down locked doors instead of wearing down a weapon's durability by hacking at them. There\u2019s a tutorial covering the basics, but the rest of Divinity: Original Sin is characterized by some of the most brazen lack of hand-holding this side of Dark Souls . That creates some annoying questing issues that, while they certainly didn\u2019t ruin my enjoyment, do need to be mentioned. Sometimes the key to one quest lies in another, and the scant quest journal rarely alludes to such overlaps. At times the awkward inventory, which demands constant  juggling of items between four team members, adds to the confoundment. At least twice I didn't realize I already had the proper quest object because it was in the inventory of character who wasn't currently in conversation. When your party's carrying an object that's akin to the Holy Grail, you'd think the bearer would at least have the gumption to announce it. I spent embarrassing swaths of time in Original Sin just trying to figure out what to do next. At the same time, I liked how not everything was spelled out for me. [Minor mechanical spoiler] When I discovered that you can pilfer a house of its valuables by using one of your party members to distract the owner in conversation while another steals, it was fantastic. [End minor spoiler.] In fact, setting aside the issues with the inventory and the occasional vague quest objective, the challenge of learning Original Sin's systems was a big part of why I enjoyed it. It compelled me to think about my actions and choices, which is more than I usually get to say about contemporary RPGs. Since the option for a skill reset doesn't appear until late in the campaign, I had to stop and start several times before I settled on two Source hunters that were well suited for confronting the occasional extreme challenges I\u2019d run into on the previous attempt. It was all grueling work that set me days behind schedule, but it was deliciously satisfying when the pieces finally started falling into place. Though Original Sin\u2019s now out of its extended Early Access beta, there are a few holes that Larian is still working to fill, such as the absence of named and voiced followers besides the warrior and mage you pick up in the first town. But this is one of those games that'll probably gain a degree of immortality itself from the community itself, as it comes equipped with extensive modding capabilities that will allow players to craft their own adventures for the Source hunters. But it's a credit to what Larian has accomplished here that those tools don't feel as essential for Original Sin's longevity as they do for some lesser RPGs."

        "Content": "Playing Peggle 2 just makes me happy. Whether I\u2019ve just hit an unbelievably improbable shot or I\u2019m watching a gratuitous display of abominable snowman twerking by new Peggle Master Berg after triggering a level-ending Extreme Fever, its ability to bring a smile to my face is uncanny. Way back in 2007, the original pachinko-meets-pinball Peggle was arguably the best puzzle game to come along since the legendary Tetris, and its sequel brushes off a few annoyances to become the first no-brainer, just-play-this-now game on the Xbox One. Peggle 2 is similar to Rock Band 2 as follow-ups go. It takes an inherently compelling formula involving colored pegs, tweaks it ever so slightly, and adds a couple new twists. The ball -- still fired from a cannon at the top of the screen \u2013 feels both a tad smaller and a bit bouncier as well. Or perhaps the pegs you\u2019re aiming to clear are themselves a bit larger. Regardless, it\u2019s neither better nor worse than the enjoyably approachable physics of Peggle 1, it\u2019s just different. You\u2019ll have no adjustment period to worry about, though. Just fire away and enjoy. Sixty new boards and another 60 trials (aka challenge maps) give you plenty of bang for your 12 bucks, particularly when each of the 60 maps has three optional objectives, such as attaining Ace-level scores, racking up a certain number of points on a single shot, or pulling off specific trick shots. Armored pegs that require two hits to clear are also clever additions, and I particularly enjoyed the devilish reversal that some of the trials pull, in which you\u2019re challenged to score under a certain amount of points when clearing the board. I do wish Peggle 2\u2019s stages had more of the crazy gimmicks and wild themes found in Peggle 1, though. Of course, Peggle 2\u2019s most obvious new additions are its four fresh Peggle Masters, who join the returning derpy but lovable Bjorn the Unicorn and his Super Guide power. Though Jeffrey\u2019s peg-crushing bowling boulder feels a bit similar to Lord Cinderbottom\u2019s dragon fireball from the first game, his screen-clearing skills would\u2019ve made him my favorite of the new foursome if not for Gnorman, whose lightning power zaps clusters of pegs all over the board as the ball bounces around. I love how the adorable heroes of Peggle 2 are given more screen real estate and extra personality this time around, so it only deepens the disappointment of learning that these five are it \u2013 meaning Peggle 2 has half as many Peggle Masters as its predecessor. If Popcap couldn\u2019t manage an all-new cast as big as the original Peggle\u2019s, it sure would\u2019ve been nice if more old friends could\u2019ve returned for the sequel. I sure miss Tula and her always-useful Flower Power ability. At least the new cast members each get his or her own Extreme Fever song; only Bjorn still busts out \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d If Peggle 2 is guilty of anything else, it\u2019s being a little bit too excited about delivering fun times. It bizarrely suffers from overscan on every TV and monitor we threw it onto. It doesn\u2019t cut off anything important, but it\u2019s noticeable and annoying. Worse, it absolutely abuses the Xbox One\u2019s GameDVR feature, automatically saving dozens of clips of your best shots. The problem is, it records shots that are no big deal, and I\u2019ve had to go into Upload Studio and purge a slew of unwanted videos. The Peg Party multiplayer mode, meanwhile, is essentially identical to the same feature found in the Xbox 360 version of the first game, in which you try to outscore up to three other players battling on their own copy of the same board. With the ability to pick any map and tweak a number of win conditions, it\u2019s good clean fun \u2013 a palate cleanser from Call of Duty or Battlefield \u2013 but it lacks local console play and the two-player Duel mode the original had too. I wonder if this will be addressed in the form of paid DLC \u2013 there\u2019s an ominous shopping cart icon on the main menu that currently says \u201ccoming soon.\u201d It\u2019d be nice if the Leaderboards the 360 edition has were brought back too. PlayStation 4 Impressions As expected, the PlayStation 4 version of Peggle 2 looks and plays identically to its Xbox One counterpart, with a few key improvements. First and foremost, both leaderboards and a local multiplayer option are here (fortunately, they've since been added to the Xbox One version too). Also, the Xbox One's overscan problem is absent on PS4, while the PS4 edition also doesn't aggressively auto-record gameplay clips because, of course, all video capturing on PS4 is handled manually. The most uniquely PS4 addition to Peggle 2, however, is the game's clever use of the DualShock 4's light bar. It lights up with the corresponding color of every peg you hit, meaning that when you play in a dark room you'll be treated to a subtle rainbow-colored light show on your controller. While it doesn't add anything tangible to the game, it's a fun idea that's very much in the spirit of Peggle's joyous attitude."

        "Content": "If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure of playing thatgamecompany\u2019s Flower on PlayStation 3, you missed out on a creative, evocative experiment that\u2019s unlike anything else. I fell in love with its calming music, stress-free exploration, and incredible aesthetic in 2009. On Vita, it's the serene bliss of Flower suffers from notable problems for the first time. Imprecise motion controls, and touch controls that take time to learn, occasionally contribute frustration to an otherwise zen experience. If you already own it on PS3 or PlayStation 4, it\u2019s yours for free on Vita -- but it's the worst way to experience this amazing game. The Greatest Outdoors Flower is a bit bewildering, conceptually, but its clean systems make it accessible and understandable despite the lack of explicit explanation. Levels begin with you controlling the force of the wind, guiding a single petal through fields of flowers. Breezing through grass and over hills brings dim, dark places to life, and each flower you touch blossoms, earning you another petal. By the end of a stage, your lonely starting petal is the centerpiece of a majestic floral trail, sailing through the sky of a gorgeous place you\u2019ve helped create. Vibrance and change is an inspiring form of visual feedback -- colorful plant life represents progress, success, and the mark you\u2019ve made in these incredible spaces. Every time I play through its 90 minute story, Flower leaves me with the same strong lasting impression I felt the first time. You are not just an explorer here: You are a creator. The uncomplicated input of its motion/tilt controls leads to a satisfying sense of minimum effort/maximum gain, allowing you to revive dead plants and open canyons by casually coasting through field and finding life to unlock at your own pace. Unfortuntely, the imprecision of Vita's motion sensor means you won't be making sharp turns in the same, effortless fashion you would on a DualShock 4. It's functional here, certainly, but takes time to learn -- in a game as brief and simple as this, spending time learning hardly ideal. The touch controls also require some effort to understand. Katamari Damacy fans will find themselves swiveling and spinning with ease, but using the left and right sides of the Vita's touch screen to guide the wind feels odd and out of place comparatively. Both inputs are fine, but come with frustrations that have no place in Flower -- and don't exist in other versions. The mechanics rarely change, but the simplicity of your interaction has a wide range of rewarding results. You achieve wondrous things, and it becomes clearer as you proceed that there\u2019s a reason for it -- despite its minimalism, Flower has phenomenal ambition and a clear goal in mind. Throughout its relaxing, stress-free discovery, Flower subtly conveys a story of life, destruction, fear, and rebirth. It has something to say about nature, humanity\u2019s destructive tendencies, and whether or not they can coexist. Games rarely feature thoughtful or relevant commentary. Flower has meaningful messaging, but it never preaches gospel or intrudes on the sublime meandering and resurrection. If metaphor or symbolism don\u2019t do anything for you, Flower is just as enjoyable as a game where you explore a dying world, discover the tasks required to resurrect it, and move on having accomplished something beautiful. Flower - PlayStation 4 Review Album 4 Images Machine Power Flower on Vita looks more like the PS3 original than the PS4's spectacular 1080p resolution and 60 frames per-second performance. It still runs smooth, looks marvelous, and is every bit as visually and aurally excellent as Flower was. After an hour or two, when it\u2019s all over, there\u2019s little room for Flower to do anything more with what it has. Within the framework of its goals, it is masterful, and it is masterful every time I play it again. Brevity enables focus, and its unexpected turns, surprising tonal themes, and climactic scenes all hit just as hard on my fifth replay as they did my first time through.",

        "Content": "From the plastic-instrument-littered graveyard of the rhythm game genre rose the original Rocksmith , a game that took the familiar note-highway interface of the Guitar Hero series and applied it to the full scale-length of a proper guitar. Using that same impressive note-recognition technology, Rocksmith 2014 makes for a much smoother learning and practicing experience thanks to its effortless presentation and more flexible approach to player progression. It\u2019s always going to be a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, but Rocksmith 2014 makes it a heck of a lot easier to sit back and enjoy the ride. The \u201c2014\u201d moniker may suggest a merely incremental upgrade from the original game, but Rocksmith 2014 has benefited from quite a significant overhaul to all facets of the experience. Most readily apparent is the completely revamped and non-linear menu navigation. Everything you need at any moment is right under your increasingly calloused fingertips. You can swiftly hop in and out of technique lessons, chord charts, songs, and the wonderfully retro Guitarcade mini-games; it never really gives you enough of a pause to put down your instrument. Gone is the regimented and repetitive Journey mode, and in its place is the new Mission mode that takes you by the hand rather than pull you by the nose. You\u2019re constantly provided with aptitude appropriate tasks to complete, such as learning a new scale or beating a certain high score in the Guitarcade, but these objectives never become roadblocks; you can decide entirely how you want to progress, and which areas you want to focus on.  There\u2019s been a variety of tweaks across the board to Rocksmith 2014\u2019s actual gameplay, most notably the new visual cues for things like tapped notes and harmonics, along with a fingerprint overlay for chords to ensure smoother playing transitions. But by far the biggest game-changer is the revamping of the Riff Repeater. This ability to isolate, slow-down, and vary the difficulty of a song section is buried in its own separate mode in the original Rocksmith. In Rocksmith 2014, you can activate it at any time - making it much easier to learn more complicated phrases such as solos on the fly and therefore much faster than before. When you eventually start to nail every note and chord in a song, Rocksmith 2014 automatically switches to Master mode and the notes just fade away. It\u2019s at these times it\u2019s at its most powerful, creating Zen-like moments when you're flush with a genuine sense of accomplishment that no Achievement Unlocked or Trophy pop-up could ever match. It\u2019s like having your training wheels suddenly explode off your bike and freewheeling it down the highway. It\u2019s truly exhilarating. Some songs will certainly take longer to master than others, but the tracklisting also feels far more considered this time around. While there\u2019s no accounting for taste, the 50 on-disc tracks available feel satisfyingly comprehensive when it comes to technique, spanning a skill range from the simple power-chords of the Ramones\u2019 Blitzkrieg Bop and Jack White\u2019s Sixteen Saltines; to carpal tunnel-inducing metal tracks like Iron Maiden\u2019s The Trooper and Mastodon\u2019s Blood and Thunder; to the technical tour de force that is Joe Satriani\u2019s Satch Boogie. If you own the original game you can import its entire track list too (for a one-time fee), and any DLC also carries across - with all of the back catalogue tracks supporting Rocksmith 2014\u2019s new gameplay features. Of course it\u2019s not enough just to play like your favourite guitar heroes; you need to sound like them too. The actual guitar tones in Rocksmith 2014 are more authentic than ever thanks to the official emulation of big-name amp makers like Marshall, Orange, and ENGL. You can play through virtual recreations of such lusted-after rigs as Marshall\u2019s JCM800 or the Orange Tiny Terror, and while they\u2019re never going to blow your hair back like the real thing, they provide near enough approximations to serve as a sort of try-before-you-buy service. Considering that Rocksmith 2014 costs less than most small practice amps, the new amp modelling alone might make it appealing to bedroom guitarists tight on space, like perhaps those in college dorm rooms. Aside from the entirely new list of songs to learn and amp models to customise, there\u2019s a suite of new Guitarcade mini-games that are essentially a fun way to forget how otherwise mundane it can be to practice scales. Not only are there more of them this time around, but they\u2019re also meatier and better presented. For example, the 2D beat-\u2019em-up inspired Scale Warriors - in which you pummel street thugs by hitting corresponding notes in alternating scales - is set across multiple urban environments, each linked with stylish 16-bit inspired cutscenes. But my favourite addition to Rocksmith 2014 is the innovative Session mode, which is honestly like nothing else I\u2019ve ever experienced in any game or piece of musical software. You pick the instruments in your four-piece backing band, customise settings such as the scale and tempo, and then you can basically go nuts all up and down the neck with the band reacting dynamically to the intensity of your playing. Not only is this a great way to explore the fretboard and experiment with new scales, but it\u2019s also an invaluable tool for honing your improvisational skills - you can even play it with a friend for some guitar solo face-offs (or face-melting-offs). It\u2019s a great vehicle for coming up with riffs of your own too, which makes it a slight shame that there\u2019s no in-game recorder to capture your ideas with. Yet for all of its features and encyclopedic approach to chords and scales, there is a ceiling to the skills Rocksmith 2014 can provide you with. It stops short of teaching you advanced techniques such as sweep-picking or more extreme two-handed tapping, but it isn\u2019t really aiming to be the be-all and end-all of guitar and bass tutelage. It\u2019s not meant to be played in a vacuum devoid of other instructional influences - you should still absolutely watch videos on YouTube, buy tablature books, jam with friends or even seek out more formal teaching if you really want to master the fretboard. Lastly, it would be remiss of me not to mention the audio latency levels. The developers claim that they\u2019ve tightened up the latency at least in terms of the software, and certainly when I played the PC version of Rocksmith 2014 or the console versions with the audio fed into a separate home theatre system (via analogue cables), the audio latency was truly imperceptible. However, when I ran the audio via HDMI straight into the back of television, there was still a noticeable delay between when a note was struck and when it sounded out of the TV speakers. So for those of you who have no external devices to output the audio to, be mindful that it may have a negative impact on your enjoyment with the game."

        "Content": "The best thing about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is that it delivers almost everything a Marvel fan could want. From Abomination to the Wizard, this game is an A-to-Z (well, A-to-W) love letter to the Marvel Universe that starts with the Silver Surfer gliding across the title screen and ends with a credits song that could not have been better chosen. A few technical glitches and some carryovers from the franchise history keep it from being an outright masterpiece, but it easily ranks as one of the best superhero games I've played in years. It starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative. The same is true of the villains. You can start by chasing Doctor Octopus from the Baxter Building to the Daily Bugle, but you'll soon be flying off to thwart Dr. Doom's plans in Latveria and taking the Rainbow Bridge to stop Loki from stirring up the frost giants in Asgard. I particularly liked how each mission played out as a sort of protracted chase, with the heroes in pursuit of folks like Magneto or the Red Skull, while battling lots of lesser villains like Pyro or the Leader along the way. As great as it all is, telling such an earth-shattering story without major characters like Dr. Strange or Sub-Mariner present feels off. Still, when a game features lesser-known characters like Black Bolt, Captain Britain and HERBIE, it's hard to complain. Maybe they're saving Kang and Ultron for a sequel? The puzzles in the LEGO games are almost always solved by matching the right power to the right problem, and the Marvel take on this mechanic is particularly inventive. Take Black Widow for example. She, like Invisible Woman, can spoof security cameras, but Widow also has the acrobatic skill of Captain America, which enables her to access remote areas of the levels, and the brains of Tony Stark, which lets her use certain consoles that would be off limits to other heroes. Throw in a gun, and you've got a very useful character made up of a number of different power sets. Storm and Thor, for instance, can both use electricity to power up stations, but Thor can smash open walls while Storm can put out fires. Even though there are only maybe a couple dozen powers to share among them all, the various combinations of powers ensures that no one feels entirely redundant. You will get a few power sets that seem a bit out of place; Captain America's ubiquitous shield switches seem a little arbitrary, as does the notion that Wolverine should be really good at digging and climbing. There are also a few that make sense but aren't particularly well implemented. The special sixth sense shared by characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil is really more for recognizing what walls you can climb than for keeping those characters out of danger.   I finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River. The city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend.  Experienced gamers won't find many of the open-world puzzles and challenges to be much of a contest; for the most part, you'll simply need to identify the type of task you're facing and then just go hit the right steps in the right order. It's clear that the challenges are aimed at LEGO\u2019s young demographic, so gamers craving a challenge will be let down here. Still, if the allure of putting Daredevil on a motorcycle and having him race Ghost Rider through the Upper West Side sounds fun, the difficulty is sort of incidental. The rare exceptions are the timed challenges, or those that require you to search out objectives that aren't in the immediate vicinity of the challenge. The biggest pain is the inconsistent, confusing flight system. It attempts to use the same control scheme from the missions where the up and down motion of the thumbstick moves your character toward or away from the camera. Now you'll use face buttons to control the pitch of your character's flight. The problem is that the button you use to ascend is also the button you use to accelerate, and I frequently found myself flying into the side of buildings or massively overshooting my objective. Even with a week or so of playing, it still seems weird to me.  Even with that one chief complaint, there's just so much to love about LEGO Marvel that I've been playing it a few hours a day for over a week now and am still finding new charms. From unlocking Gwen Stacy and making her jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to watching the heroes dance at Tony Stark's house parties, this game is full of the moments that make Marvel one of the best brands in entertainment.

        "Content": "I was only level 12, barely a couple of hours into my first runthrough of Diablo III when it happened. My Witch Doctor was neck-deep in battle on the Fields of Misery, bloody body parts, loot, and gold spraying everywhere when suddenly a ring hit the ground with a distinctive clang, shining a bright, amber shaft of light into the air. It was Leoric's Signet Ring \u2013 a Legendary drop. With its whopping 23% bonus to experience gain, it would stay on my finger beyond even the 30 some-odd hours it took to reach level 60. When I finally find a better ring to replace it, I'll pass it down to my next character to speed them on their travels through Sanctuary. This game changing drop, the first of what would be many, embodies what makes Diablo III on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 so special. It creates a cycle of tangible reward that had me hopelessly and happily trapped like a hamster on an action-RPG wheel. Oftentimes, games that make the transition from PC to consoles flop around awkwardly like a fish out of water, but Diablo III navigates the stream confidently. Not only is it flush with all the PC version\u2019s content, but it comes with few of the drawbacks. Gripes about the always-on internet connection requirement? Gone. Cancerous auction houses? Vanished. The weak story and corny writing? Okay, that\u2019s still here. But, far more important are the tweaks that Blizzard has implemented to make Diablo III the game it always should have been, one that hits most of the notes my inner Diablo fan craves while welcoming newcomers with open arms. The action is every bit as beefy and bombastic as ever, but the loot game has changed dramatically, and for the better. It calls itself an action-RPG, but Diablo III is an action game first and foremost. After all, whether in single-player or co-op with up to three other adventurers, you spend most of your time wading through hordes of skeletons, zombies, succubi, and all manner of other awesome-looking hellspawn, usually with little respite between scraps. With so much constant action, the transition from mouse and keyboard to gamepad could easily have been a disaster, but instead, it feels natural and \u2013 in some ways \u2013 even better. Moving about with the left analog stick feels very direct, creating a sense of connection with my avatars as they bob, weave, and generally wreck shop. The new dodge mechanic on the right stick adds a level of mobility that really jives with the way enemy encounters are designed. This goes double for the many great boss battles, where rolling to evade their massive onslaughts feels so useful it's hard to imagine playing without it. Targeting is handled by simply facing in your foe's direction and letting the auto-aim figure out the rest. It sounds like playing on autopilot, but for the most part it's a surprisingly elegant solution. Ranged characters may have minor issues picking a specific target out of a tightly packed mob, but it never got me killed or led to frustration. And it certainly didn\u2019t make decimating the denizens of the Burning Hells any less satisfying. But then, I don't know that anything could. No matter which of the five classes you play, you\u2019ll have a vast array of skills to choose from as you level up, each more fun to use than the last. Barbarians hit with a palpable, limb-severing violence that\u2019s instantly gratifying, while the Witch Doctor\u2019s more artful setups made me feel both crafty and explosively destructive all at once. And boy, do Diablo's cronies know how to sell a hit. Skeleton parts litter the air as I detonate my zombie dogs, eviscerated corpses reel from my Monk's lashing tail kick, and defeated demons rear back and scream to the heavens as they disintegrate from the ground up. It's all incredibly well-animated, instilling the combat with an irresistible sense of raw, kinetic force. Of course, all that spectacular carnage is a lot to handle, especially when the screen is filled from top to bottom with the teeming hordes of Hell. Getting it all to happen while mostly maintaining 60 frames per second comes at a price in terms of graphical fidelity. While this version of Diablo III isn't ugly by any means, it largely gets by on the strength of Blizzard's art department, whose skill is evident in every loose cathedral stone and gnarled tree branch. As strong as the art direction is, there's just no ignoring the fuzziness of the textures, or (relative to the PC version) some toned-down spell effects. Even those concessions don\u2019t keep the framerate from dipping a bit when the action crescendos, but overall, Diablo III\u2019s performance is impressive given how joyously chaotic the battles can get. Less impressive, at least in terms of their looks, are the new gamepad-friendly menus and interface. It might seem petty to knock a game for using a plain-looking font for the sake of readability, or revising the iconic inventory screen into something more console-friendly than the traditional paper doll, but all those little differences add up to drain just a bit of that gothic Diablo flavor I\u2019ve grown to love over the last 17 years. Thankfully, they make up for their lack of character with sheer functionality. The new radial-style inventory screen takes a bit of getting used to at first, but once you understand it, parsing through gear and equipping what you want becomes a total breeze. A new \u201cquick equip\u201d function mapped to the D-pad allows you to swiftly scan, drop, or equip your most recent acquisitions without even opening a menu. A larger carrying capacity means fewer trips back to town, and item identification has been all but eliminated, too. These wise refinements all add up to less time spent staring at that new Legendary sword, and more time spent swinging it. And you can actually expect to find your fair share of Legendaries, a probably not-coincidental effect of the wholesale removal of the auction houses (funny how that works.) Drop rates have been tuned up dramatically, and the effect it has on the item hunt is difficult to overstate. Legendaries can truly shift your character's progression, either with stats that dwarf those of other comparably leveled items, or with unique traits that no other item has. It could be a gauntlet that augments the damage of all your fire skills, or an axe that has a chance to summon a ghostly warrior to fight at your side, but whatever it is, it almost always feels substantial and exciting. As many of the best Legendaries are only found in Inferno, the highest difficulty setting, playing past max level becomes an irresistible prospect for the loot-hungry. PC Diablo III's endgame content has seen significant additions and iterations since launch in order to fix what the community didn\u2019t like, and all of that carries over to this version as well. Combined with the new attainability of the most exciting items, farming and replaying feel exciting and tangibly rewarding in ways the PC version never was in the over 200 hours I sank into it. As fun as the climb to 60 is, your character isn't truly \u201ccomplete\u201d until you hit Paragon level 100, have perfect gear, and can plow through Inferno with Monster Power set to maximum. There\u2019s just a ton to do here. If that's somehow not enough replay value for you, you can always explore Diablo III's multiplayer options. Online co-op can be invite only, or drop-in/drop-out, and the ability to specifically seek partners for PvP or endgame key-warden content makes it easy to find a party that suits your mood. But as nice as that it is, nothing beats the four-player couch co-op. Transferring characters over via cloud, or USB is simple and painless, and no matter whose system you\u2019re playing on, you get to keep what you find. Mining demon-infested dungeons for loot until 2 A.M., fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with friends is an experience that precious few, if any games deliver anymore, and even fewer have done it as well as Diablo III."

        "Content": "Gunpoint is a prime example of a small, relatively simple game that that exudes sheer elegance. Every aspect of its clever design, laugh-out-loud noir story, tiny but expressive art, and moody music work harmoniously with one another towards creating a truly unique 2D puzzle platforming experience. Nothing feels out of place, there\u2019s little fat needed to be trimmed. Both the act of movement and its inventive take on hacking work wonderfully throughout the entire three-hour campaign of comedic industrial espionage and murder mystery.   After acquiring a pair of futuristic trousers, your private eye protagonist gains the ability to hop across the world as he sees fit. It\u2019s tough to describe just how great the leaping mechanic feels. Charting the trajectory of your arc, taking to the air like a bullfrog, clinging to walls like Spider-Man, and not having to worry about suffering any damage from a long fall (beyond a goofy bellyflop) make maneuvering through the small levels a complete joy. But great mobility is only one half of Gunpoint\u2019s puzzle \u2013 the other is its superb hacking mechanics.  Early on in the 11-mission campaign, you gain the ability to flip to a silhouetted view and reroute the circuits of any building, which allows you to create environmental \u201cif-then\u201d equations that help you navigate various security systems. For example, you can link a security camera to a light, then reroute a nearby light switch so that flicking it causes a nearby door to swing open. With this in place, you can step in front of the camera to activate it, which causes the light to go off, which causes a guard in that darkened room try to turn them back on by flicking the light switch, which instead knocks him unconscious as the door flies open. It's supremely satisfying to see the dominos fall exactly as planned.  Puzzles and possibilities only grow more intense as Gunpoint progresses, and the freedom you have in terms of navigating the various levels gives you a satisfying sense of authorship over your playthrough. I\u2019ve never experienced anything quite like this core system of Gunpoint, but I have a feeling that plenty of games are going to draw inspiration from it in the coming years. Stealth is encouraged, but delightfully that\u2019s done only by giving you a set of tools that makes it possible and tempting. If you want to simply murder everybody in your path, either with guns, traps, or hilariously tackling and repeatedly punching them on the ground, that\u2019s just fine. The post-puzzle scoring system doesn\u2019t withhold an A+ from those who choose to use lethal force, but applies different labels like \u201cGentleman\u201d or \u201cPsychopath\u201d to acknowledge your approach. That\u2019s an extremely liberating freedom to play however you want.  Gunpoint further encourages experimentation through its ingenious autosave feature that gives you a handful of options regarding where to restart a level if you happen to die. If I get spotted by a guard and gunned down the moment I step off an elevator, I\u2019m given the option to restart 2 seconds, 5 seconds, or 10 seconds before my poor decision. A tough challenge becomes much more manageable if you don\u2019t have to wade through the same stretch a dozen times in order to reach the point of contention.  Sadly this autosave feature ran into a few hitches, and a few times I found myself being presented with a trio of restart options that were all well over a minute before I died. This only occurred a handful of times, but it was enough to irk me when it did happen (probably because I\u2019d become so spoiled by the convenience of it). But even the most frustrating moments were bearable thanks to the impeccable writing contained throughout Gunpoint.   Dialogue between missions is consistently hilarious, and some light conversation trees allow you to dictate what kind of a private eye they want to be. You can answer questions straight and play the murder mystery as a detective for hire worthy of Sam Spade, or if you\u2019re like me, you can continually make self-aware comments on the ridiculous nature of corporate espionage and the insane lengths you have to go in order to complete a mission, such as crashing out a six-story window and scurrying into a subway tunnel as guards nip at your heels. By the end of Gunpoint, I viewed my character as a hard-boiled Sterling Archer, and I couldn\u2019t have been happier with my choice.  The sharp writing is complemented by Gunpoint\u2019s minimal-yet-functional visuals, which refrain from cluttering the environment with ancillary details in favor of presenting information via the objects on screen. For example, if your cursor changes color when you highlight a certain area, that means your hero can hide there completely out of sight. Likewise, scrolling over certain pieces of the level brings up a bit of background information, your thoughts on the object, or how it might be used to your advantage. It feels like developer Suspicious Developments took some of the best elements of classic SCUMM adventure games like The Secret of Monkey Island and used them to help flesh out this neo-noir world. I thoroughly enjoyed the brief time I spent with Gunpoint, but I still couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit unsatisfied upon reaching its ending. My problem isn\u2019t with the campaign\u2019s short length or the conclusion of the story, but rather how it felt like it ended before it could really reach its crescendo. It seemed like Gunpoint was still teaching me about its mechanics and revealing its world all the way up to the end, but the credits rolled before I could be given a proper final exam. However, Gunpoint does include a level editor that allows would-be creators to design their own challenges using the tools contained within the campaign that will hopefully bear Rube Goldberg-esque fruit in the future."

        "Title": "Pixel People Review",
        "Subtitle": "Human Cloning For Fun and Profit.",
        "Content": "Pixel People is the first mobile game of 2013 to truly sink its teeth into me and refuse to let go. The game combines casual town building and Doodle God-style element mixing into a surprisingly deep and endlessly compelling package of awesome. Pixel People\u2019s light monetization hooks and great pixel art style put it over the edge and make it a must-download. The game\u2019s premise would be a little dark if it weren\u2019t presented in such a whimsical, matter-of-fact way. With the earth blown up and humanity wiped out, it\u2019s up to the player to rebuild society, one cloned profession at a time. Players start with just two unlocked professions \u2013 Mayor and Mechanic. Splicing them together unlocks the Engineer. Combining Engineer with Mayor unlocks Architect, and so-on. By the end players will have 150 total professions unlocked, each with their own cute pixel art portrait. Most professions unlock new buildings or bonuses when discovered, giving Pixel People a great gameplay loop. Unlocking the Pilot profession (Valet + Mechanic) not only gives you one more citizen, boosting your income, but it also unlocks a new Space Port building. Many buildings also serve special purposes. Once good example: the Police Officer (Sheriff + Sherriff) unlocks the Police Department when discovered. Once the building is finished players can use it to access an Achievements menu, unlocking a bevy to new goals to chase down. At its core, Pixel People is a simple town-building appointment game. In the beginning you\u2019ll always have something to do. But by the time you have more than 100 citizens, most buildings will take 24 hours or more to complete and it\u2019ll be 30 minutes or more before you get a new clone to splice.  Stuck? IGN has a complete guide to all of Pixel People's profession recipes , residences , decorations , achievements and more. Check it!  Players only interested in casually tapping around will still (slowly) progress through Pixel People, but there is a surprising amount of depth for min/maxers to consider as well. With a finite amount of space to build, every construction project becomes a real decision. Is it best to build more coin-giving trees, or more construction cost-reducing decorations? Where a citizen works also makes a big impact on income. Smart and observant players will likely make money twice as quickly as more casual players. Of course, as a freemium title, players that are willing to pay up can skip these wait times and strategic concerns entirely. Players can purchase Utopium, Pixel People\u2019s premium currency, in bundles ranging from $1.99 to $24.99. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 not all freemium titles treat their currency the same. And Pixel People is one of the most generous and reasonable examples in recent memory. Players that never pay a cent will still enjoy a steady trickle of Utopium via tree harvests, a Utopium Mine and other sources. A patient player playing for free could see and do everything the game has to offer. Additionally, the premium features that are here are very reasonably priced. Speeding up a building just costs just a few cents, not a few dollars. Pixel People remains thoroughly enjoyable from its brisk beginning to its much more leisurely paced end-game. But there are a few nits worth picking. Its isometric perspective can make it tricky to select buildings. Some of the menus can be a bit labyrinthine, with important info sometimes hidden away in hard-to-find spots. But my biggest concern is the game\u2019s structure strongly encouraging very frequent check-ins. Businesses produce income for a set length of time before they have to be reset with tap from the player. But these times range from 2 minutes up to just a few hours. Players don\u2019t suffer any penalty for not checking in, but anyone that wants to remain anywhere close to peak efficiency might be driven a bit batty by the game\u2019s short work schedules. Why can\u2019t buildings re-up in hours or days instead of minutes? ",

        "Content": "Mass Effect\u2019s extremely late appearance on the PlayStation 3 seems to prove the old adage \u201cnothing is impossible\u201d. After all, Microsoft published the original game, which came to Xbox 360 in 2007 and PC in 2008. Even after Electronic Arts acquired developer BioWare in 2008, it appeared Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the original remained as tight as ever, as PS3 gamers got Mass Effect 2 and 3 with no sign of the first third of the trilogy. Yet, here it is: Mass Effect on PlayStation 3, running in much the same fashion as the original did on Xbox 360 some five years ago. It\u2019s about as late to the party as you could possibly imagine, yet for PlayStation 3 gamers, it may be the very first chance you\u2019ve ever had to play the first game in the trilogy. Whether it\u2019ll be your maiden foray through the game or if you simply want to enjoy it again on a different platform, Mass Effect on PS3 is well worth your time and money. The original Mass Effect sets off the trilogy\u2019s epic story by introducing you to a majority of the series\u2019 important characters, namely Commander Shepard, the male or female avatar through which you experience the franchise\u2019s events. Shepard is fully customizable; you\u2019ll have full reign over your character\u2019s gender, looks, background and class. And yes: many of the choices you make even at the outset, during character customization, can and will have lasting ramifications down the road, not only in Mass Effect but in its two sequels. Such choices are Mass Effect\u2019s hallmark, and they truly shine in the original. Mass Effect\u2019s story, or at least what sets it off, is easy enough to understand. Through the discovery of ancient technology on both Mars and orbiting Pluto developed by an extinct space-faring race, humanity gains unfettered access to presumably unexplored parts of the Milky Way. Or so they thought, for humans end up stumbling across an already established group of alien races. After some initial battles with one race in particular \u2013 the Turians \u2013 the citizens of Earth are welcomed into the galactic community as its newest (and most untrusted) members. Fast-forward several generations from that point, and you\u2019ll collide head-on with the events that transpire in Mass Effect itself. Commander Shepard is a living and breathing sign of human progress to both the Alliance and alien species, invited to join the Spectres, a secretive and elite special forces group that does the bidding of the Council, the accepted UN-like organization binding the galaxy\u2019s sentient races. And it\u2019s from there that Mass Effect\u2019s brilliant story sets off running. It\u2019s, in essence, the very first part of what is perhaps the most interesting and engaging story ever told in gaming. In retrospect, it\u2019s easy to see \u2013 with five years\u2019 of hindsight \u2013 how markedly different the original Mass Effect is from the two games that came after it. Its gameplay is loose, less exact and even a little bit muddled, a stark contrast to the far tighter gameplay developed as the series progressed. But it\u2019s also different in ways that make it stand out positively from the otherwise superior Mass Effects 2 and 3, especially in one way in particular: Mass Effect is a tried-and-true RPG, not something with mere elements of the genre. It\u2019s unclear why BioWare later abandoned the in-depth minutiae of the original\u2019s complex experience, upgrading and customization options, but the developer did. So as you run around alien worlds and mysterious ships, expect to earn experience points constantly. Hack a computer or open a box of items? You\u2019ll get experience. Engage in a lengthy conversation or unlock new entries in your (exceptionally engrossing) codex? You\u2019ll get experience. And of course, you\u2019ll get experience for fighting enemies, discovering important items and materials on planets spanning the galaxy and more. It\u2019s not like Mass Effect 2 and (especially) 3, where you get finite amounts of experience for completing certain tasks, and that\u2019s it. Nearly everything you do in Mass Effect has the ability to, in turn, radically alter your characters\u2019 growth trajectory, and other than its wonderful plot, this point in particular is the single biggest facet that makes Mass Effect so damn good. All characters in your party, in turn, can be built up utilizing a number of classes and loadouts. When compared to the two games that followed it, Mass Effect \u2013 by far \u2013 gives players the most customization options, from weapon and armor loadouts to specific permutations of weapons and armor modified by items you find in the wild. Players will also be able to spend skill points earned by leveling up to make their character stronger, though you won\u2019t get to fill in all of the powers unless you are playing for a second or third time, so choose carefully. Options like these open Mass Effect up to be played like a straight-forward shooter or a more tactical, third-person action game, or really anything else in between. Mass Effect helps propel the oft-used feature of some of the best RPGs of all-time \u2013 non-linearity \u2013 to help give players an exceptionally gratifying sense of openness. Once you get through the beginning of the game, you can complete much of the meat of the game in any order you\u2019d like. Side quests galore are there for the undertaking and dozens of systems demand your exploratory attention while the game\u2019s primary arc rests in the background, waiting for you to undertake story-driven quests at your leisure. It\u2019s easy to derive a great deal of gaming pleasure out of taking your time with Mass Effect, exploring and conversing. And since the game incessantly revolves around choice, there\u2019s plenty of reason to play more than once. Unfortunately, for as great as Mass Effect is, it\u2019s weighed-down by many of the same problems found in the Xbox 360 original. The game\u2019s graphics look great, especially for an early-in-the-generation game, but animations at times look stiff and even comical, and the framerate drops from time to time. There was a part in the game where the framerate dropped so severely (and permanently) that I had to manually restart my PlayStation 3. Mass Effect is deservedly well-known for its stellar soundtrack, which is intact here, but voice acting \u2013 while superbly executed for the most part \u2013 doesn\u2019t always sync up to any given character\u2019s lips. For a game that revolves around how immersive it is, this is\u2026 well\u2026 the exact opposite of that. Mass Effect on PS3 also suffers from the outrageous load times from the original, rife with pesky elevator rides and the like that barely obscure what the game\u2019s trying to hide. If you die in battle, it\u2019ll take 25 seconds or so to get back into the action, an excruciatingly long time. Frustrating texture pop-in is frequent. And should you keep auto-save on \u2013 and you absolutely should \u2013 expect the game to freeze for a few seconds every time it saves. Then again, these technical problems, while at times glaring, don\u2019t bring Mass Effect too far down. In this sense, Mass Effect reminds me a bit of Fallout 3: it\u2019s a game with unavoidable technical problems that don\u2019t bother most gamers nearly as much as they should because the product surrounding some shoddy tech is so amazing. Mass Effect is one of those games that make it easy to ignore its problems because the core of the game \u2013 its story, customization, non-linearity and more \u2013 make it such a pleasure to play."

        "Content": "For a game built upon the concept of slipping by unnoticed, Hitman: Absolution is certainly doing the opposite. It\u2019s standing conspicuously amongst today\u2019s fad-driven modern shooters and me-too multiplayer hopefuls, middle fingers extended. A slow-paced, single-player focused sneak \u2019em up, Absolution looms in stark opposition to many of the most pervading trends in gaming today. It cares not for the overly delicate, their minds rendered dull and flabby after years of being prodded through corridors blasting anything that breathes. Absolution delights in letting players skulk through it expending few bullets at all. It\u2019s a game that wants to let you think for yourself. A game that wants to remind you that trial and error done right equals satisfaction, not frustration. For those of you counting at home it\u2019s been 2368 days since Hitman: Blood Money was released, give or take. That\u2019s a long time between drinks. It\u2019s nearly six-and-a-half years. In video game terms that\u2019s somewhere in the Cretaceous Period. In actual fact the besuited Agent 47 and his barcoded dome have spent the vast bulk of this generation on the sideline. Hitman: Absolution has been a long time coming, a fact fans are acutely aware of. The pressure to deliver, then, is high. Blood Money may be a dinosaur in some respects but it remains a cult favourite adored by its faithful fans. Six-and-a-half years on the team at Io Interactive must ship a successor to it worthy of the wait. The good news is, they have. Above everything, Absolution is a game that wants you to experiment with it. It refuses to be rushed through, rewarding brains over brawn. It wants you to spend time inside it, methodically picking your way around and discovering morbid new ways to snuff out your unfortunate marks. Like Blood Money before it, your targets here can be executed in a host of ever-so-slightly sickeningly different ways. Returning Hitman fans won\u2019t settle for a simple bullet to the back of the head; they\u2019ll immediately be on the lookout for the tell-tale signs of a classic Hitman kill opportunity. Some of them are more subtle than others but, like Blood Money, they\u2019re all there, waiting to be discovered. A couple of the game\u2019s kills are more tightly choreographed for dramatic effect, complete with a brief cutscene of your deserved victim sucking in their last breaths, but most of the game\u2019s kills \u2013 two dozen of them at least \u2013 are traditional Hitman fare. How you take them out is in your hands. This is a slow-paced, measured experience. This is not Medal of Duty: Modern Warfighter Ops. Impatient action junkies need not apply. The way Absolution itself plays is very much a refined version of what Io attempted with its previous effort, but gone are most of the quirks Hitman diehards were happy to overlook in Blood Money. 47 feels far more connected to the environment rather than skating about on it, and successfully sneaking up on a target from behind with your signature fibre wire is no longer quite as fickle an exercise. It\u2019s all a lot more organic and a lot less stiff. Furthermore Absolution adds a host of additional abilities for 47. 47\u2019s limited use sedatives, for instance, are no longer necessary because of his close-quarters combat skills. Sneak up on an enemy or NPC unawares and you can grab them and either subdue or kill them with your bare hands. It\u2019s just like Blood Money, where you could simply take people as a human shield and then knock them cold with the butt of your pistol when your syringes ran dry, only without all that rigmarole (although, of course, you can still do that too). There\u2019s a cover system that allows you to properly exchange fire with enemies when things go pear-shaped, rather than being stuck out in the open desperately strafing left and right. When you\u2019re playing as you should, stealthily and patiently, the cover system is even more useful, allowing you to spring from behind it as enemies pass by to quietly choke them out, or snap their necks. You can also fake surrender too, disarming your would-be captor and taking him hostage. There have been tweaks to the shooting system too. Point Shooting, which is a slo-mo power-up that functions not unlike a similar power-up in Splinter Cell Conviction, works fine but Hitman veterans will almost certainly never use it outside the couple of instances it\u2019s required throughout the game. Rabid Hitman fans simply won\u2019t be doing the levels of indiscriminate killing that would warrant the use of Point Shooting. You can\u2019t get Silent Assassin ratings by mowing down scores of henchmen in slow-motion. Better is Precision Shot, which allows you to gently squeeze the trigger to steady your aim before actually firing. It feels very natural; it\u2019s a hugely better solution than the normal \u201cclick-here-to-hold-your-breath\u201d malarkey. Then there\u2019s Instinct Mode, which is basically 47\u2019s intuition represented visually. Instinct Mode remains a true bone of contention for some but at its most fundamental level this replaces the previous, god-like minimap. 47 can sense nearby enemies and you can note where they are in relation to him. How you use it beyond that is really up to you. New Hitman players can use it as a crutch, noting enemy patrol paths or objects of interest. Veterans can simply refer to it sparingly or dial it down entirely. On the higher of the game\u2019s five difficulty settings it\u2019s automatically neutered anyway. On the topic of difficulty settings, there are five \u2013 and they cover the whole spectrum. Easy is exceedingly so, and Purist is insane. The sweet spot for a first play through is probably Normal or Hard. Enemy reaction times are quite forgiving in Normal and the game will tolerate some sloppiness on your part at the expense of realism, but it\u2019s a good setting to build up an understanding of the levels. Hard ramps things up. It\u2019s interesting to note that enemy NPCs aren\u2019t just sharper on higher difficulties; there are also more of them. Depending on your approach you may well find your undetected route through a level on Normal completely thwarted by an added patrol on Hard. When things do go sour the adjustments to how enemies react to your presence is also welcome. If you\u2019re spotted and you can contain the situation by subduing or killing all nearby witnesses before they inform others an alert won\u2019t be raised. This is a refreshing change from Blood Money, where one foul up would dispatch every enemy on the map against you like heat-seeking missiles. Absolution looks good. There\u2019s arguably a bit too much lighting bloom, particularly when harsh light begins to glint off 47\u2019s cue ball bonce, but it\u2019s not going to be something that\u2019ll have you dropkicking the disc down your driveway in disgust. It\u2019s darker and grittier than Hitman titles past but the visuals shouldn\u2019t raise many complaints. It looks its best at its busiest; when you\u2019re threading your way through the game\u2019s thick crowds. It\u2019s these moments when you\u2019re keenly aware you\u2019re playing something a little different. The levels are nicely dressed and the cutscenes are well-produced; it\u2019s a solid effort all around. It sounds great too. The dynamic score which picks up as the action mounts is well implemented, and there are quite a few moments where the audio design really pops. Approaching and opening a closed door to a loud, bustling bar, for instance, sees the sound launch from a subtle hum of chatter and muffled music to a roar of raised voices and bass. It\u2019s well crafted. Hitman games are all about atmosphere, and Absolution gets it right. There are 20 levels but many are broken up into a series of stages. The key difference between this and Blood Money is the levels are segmented. Instead of one big level, say, like the Heaven and Hell Club, levels in Absolution are often completed in discrete chunks. For instance, there may be one or more areas that need to be stealthily navigated and passed through before you can reach the area where your target is. Some levels have several targets spread over multiple stages. The Attack of the Saints level, for instance, has you slowly taking out all seven leather-clad nun assassins over the course of three distinct areas. The controversial trailer released featuring 47 taking them out in a tightly-compressed flurry of moves cribbed from several viewings of The Bourne Identity really did this level a disservice. They're nothing alike. Overall Absolution is a success, although not universally so. The change to the disguise system, for instance, is a good idea not fully-formed. It makes sense that NPCs wearing the same type of clothing are able to recognise you as an imposter; it means you can\u2019t just don a disguise and stroll through the game's levels. It\u2019d be too easy. The system should scale, however. It\u2019s logical a small group of janitors would recognise a stranger in their midst; less so that every Chicago policeman knows the faces of every one of his thousands of fellow officers so well that he can always spot an intruder. Both the cover system and the Blend system, where 47 casually dips his head and obscures his face as he passes threats, are Io\u2019s answers to these. On normal difficulty it does create a certain degree of absurdity when simply ducking down behind a parked car and breaking line of sight or surreptitiously covering your face with your hand can allay suspicion, but a balance does have to be struck between credibility and playability. If you\u2019re finding things too easy I\u2019d advise you to progress to the game\u2019s incredibly unforgiving Expert and Purist modes, where enemies react far faster. The nature of Absolution\u2019s story-mode, which features 47 on the run and, for several very early levels, without even his signature Silverballers, is also quite different from Blood Money. It may leave some fans a little wanting considering you no longer select your preferred equipment before missions and such, but Contracts mode is there to fill that gap. Contracts mode is Absolution\u2019s true sandbox, where you can create your own custom hits within the game\u2019s levels with its clever play to create system, choosing whatever NPCs, weapons or disguises you want. Better still, you can challenge your friends to complete your contracts faster and more efficiently than you. Pausing a level in story mode will also present you with an opportunity to play a user-created Contract instead. Contracts mode will be the lifeblood of Absolution once you\u2019ve clocked the story mode, but that\u2019s not to say Io hasn\u2019t been experimenting with ways of hooking players in hard. Absolution may be steadfastly single-player focused, but Io has embraced the 2012 trend of connectivity. Upon completion of a level Absolution will award you with a score, and that score will be instantly compared to both your friends playing Absolution, the rest of your country, and the rest of the world. You can see how far above or below your score is tracking in relation to your friend average, your country average and the world average. The score system takes some working out, but basically signature and accident kills for your designated target net you big bonuses. Being spotted and killing civilians and non-targets see significant penalties. You can subdue people for a small score penalty, but you can scrub that penalty by hiding their unconscious bodies. You\u2019ll get an idea for different solutions for levels via the awards at their completion. They\u2019ll give you hints of traps you perhaps didn\u2019t spring, or items, weapons or disguises you didn\u2019t find."

        "Content": "Expectations were high from the first time IGN wrote about developer Giant Sparrow. Aside from working on a game that looks like nothing else on the PlayStation Network, comparisons to flow, Flower, and Journey developer thatgamecompany were immediately drawn. Both Giant Sparrow and thatgamecompany sprung from the USC game design program and both were snatched up by PlayStation for three-game contracts. The Unfinished Swan is Giant Sparrow's first game from its deal, and it's nothing short of spectacular. \"Unflinching simplicity\" defines The Unfinished Swan. Playing it is more akin to turning the pages of a worn Golden Book of your favorite childhood stories. This isn't like playing one of the dozens of other games grasping for your attention as the holiday season ramps up. This is about meditating with serene music and watching as the story unfolds. A pleasant-voiced woman tells us the tale of the orphan Monroe, whose mother's passing left him with a wealth of her unfinished paintings. The orphanage would only allow him to keep one, and it's on a seemingly ordinary night that he awakes to find the unfinished swan he chose missing from the painting itself. Monroe leaps into the blank canvas, and the game is afoot. Now, if you've seen or heard about The Unfinished Swan, what comes next might sound like all the game is -- but don't be fooled. Dropped into a completely white world, you hurl black paint to bring your surroundings to life from the first-person perspective. Each blob brings definition -- a wall here, a stump there, a hallway over yonder -- and slowly but surely sets Monroe down a path of discovery. It's breathtaking and intriguing, but it's just the beginning of what The Unfinished Swan has to show us. The true beauty of the game is that each chapter of the storybook brings a new gameplay element or environment into view that has little to nothing to do with black paint. The hurling of water to create vines, moving a glowing orb for protection, building platforms -- it might all sound like a jumble of incomplete thoughts now, but those eureka moments are the heart of the game and it would do me no good to spoil them for you here. Just know that -- again, like Journey -- there's far more to this title than the previews and trailers have led you to believe and the diversity of what's to come is unmistakably beautiful. Playing The Unfinished Swan is best paired with a cup of cocoa, a comfy blanket, and surround sound headphones. \u201c Yes, the tasks set before you aren't all the challenging -- sometimes you need to use water to move a contraption and sometimes you need to scale a vine wall -- but that isn't the point of The Unfinished Swan. You're not here to be perplexed with Portal puzzles. You're here to hear Monroe's story. Connecting it all is the kindly woman's story and the swan Monroe's chasing down. Even in pitch black areas or whiteout conditions, golden swan footprints will stick out to guide your moves. Golden letters will spring from the side of walls, and the splat of your paint will unveil the next segment in the kindly woman's story.   Which brings us back to \"unflinching simplicity.\" This lovely story took me just under two hours to run through in my first playthrough. For me, that felt perfect -- The Unfinished Swan didn't overstay its welcome and it didn't lose its focus for the sake of extending its playtime. However, I know not every gamer making the $14 investment will see it that way. Still, the game is aching to be replayed. Each level features collectible balloons that you can then spend on in-game \"toys\" such as a balloon radar, concept art, and so on. Maybe you'd even like to tinker with the PlayStation Move controls, although I found moving via the trigger on the wand to be too tank-like for my tastes. Still, those goodies and the PlayStation Network Trophies aren't what make me want to pick the controller back up. I want to play The Unfinished Swan to get lost in the storybook one more time. To have the docile tunes of the Nashville Scoring Orchestra dance through my headphones. To find Easter eggs like the one on the darkside of The Unfinished Swan's moon. To go back and unwind with a good book."

        "Content": "When you\u2019ve managed to create an unexpectedly great first entry for a franchise, it begs the question: What the hell do you do with the sequel? In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you\u2019ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply. The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there\u2019s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn\u2019t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you\u2019re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. Guns really do make up the bulk of the loot, and that\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to spend most of your time in Borderlands 2 staring down a gun sight. No matter the quest, at some point something or someone is getting pounded with lead. Thankfully, snappy shooting and lots of environmental hazards combine with each class\u2019s unique ability to turn every skirmish into a playground. You simply have to decide the best -- or most entertaining -- way to kill everyone. While many guns operate similarly to one another, the stats and augmentations are just complex enough to create a seemingly endless number of combinations, without being so diverse that they\u2019re hard to understand at a glance. You roll in, you kill anything that looks at you the wrong way, and then you walk around and look at items, utilizing the handy on-screen comparison tools to see if you\u2019ve found something at all better than what you\u2019re already holding. It keeps things from dragging, and drives you rapidly onward in the never-ending quest for loot. Seeing as how Borderlands 2 takes cues from numerous RPGs, I still find myself disappointed with the lack of visual customization options (Borderlands 2 features the ability to reskin your character, but only with blanket skins that change the look of their body and their head). However, when it comes to class skill customization, Borderlands 2 is heading in the right direction. Like the first game, Borderlands 2\u2019s four classes each have a unique ability. Unlike the original, though, a lot of options have been added to the skill trees to make it possible to create much more diverse builds...at least to a point. No matter what, every Commando will be about using turrets, every Gunzerker about raging out and blasting people with two weapons at once, every Siren about using a stun ability called Phase Lock, and every Assassin about temporarily cloaking and unleashing devastating surprise attacks. But how those abilities and characters function can be tailored to your playstyle (and can be changed over and over again for a negligible fee on a whim). For instance your Assassin might be focused on sniping and avoiding damage, while mine could be tailored to get in close and melee enemies while taking it on the chin. On the surface two people\u2019s takes on a class might seem similar, but the new, more filled out skill trees allow you to create a version of a class that better suits your style. Trying out skills and then reassigning skill points over and over is important in Borderlands 2, especially when you consider that you can play alone or with up to three other people. Grouping in Borderlands 2 makes the combat feel different; enemies get harder and you can use each class\u2019s power to support your allies. The Commando could toss out a turret, drawing enemy fire while the Assassin closes in and pummels enemies to death, for instance. Since loot is shared you need to pick your partners carefully. Playing with strangers or super aggressive friends means you\u2019ll likely find yourself in a race to see who can grab everything the fastest, and that\u2019s really not all that fun. No matter how you feel about Diablo III, making it so each player only sees their own loot is brilliant design, and it\u2019s a shame Borderlands 2 takes it in a route that means people are competing with one another. If you want to take your character\u2019s customization even further, Borderlands 2\u2019s new Badass Ranking system gives you plenty of ways to work for it. A host of in-game challenges track things like headshots with a specific weapon class, or looting a large number of chests. As you finish each of these tasks for the first time, you\u2019re given a token you can spend on a number of tiny boosts that affect stats like reload speed, recoil reduction and weapon damage. The bonuses per token are really small, but as you earn more than 100 of them, the benefits really start to add up. Best of all, these bonuses benefit every character you create, giving them a bit of a head start (you can turn it off if you don\u2019t want the bonus). It\u2019s another way Borderlands 2 makes you feel consistently rewarded, and it provides plenty of incentive to use weapons or play differently than you otherwise would. Plot wise, Borderlands 2 is a direct sequel, with a story that picks up shortly after the first. You play one of four new Vault Hunters who\u2019ve come to Pandora to hunt for \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 vaults. Unfortunately, since the opening of the last vault the planet\u2019s been all but taken over by Hyperion Corporation and its insidious and somewhat charming leader, Handsome Jack. Through a number of events outside of your control, you end up getting wrapped up in a plot to stop Jack, save the world and help out some of the citizens and beloved characters from the first game. The main story hits on notes you\u2019ve probably encountered in hundreds of other games but, despite being clich\u00e9d and more than a little predictable, it\u2019s still far more successful than in the original. Borderlands 2\u2019s campaign narrative actually tells a coherent story, with endearing characters who manage to feel nuanced and real. At times the story can even be touching and heavy, though this is when it starts to feel a bit at odds with Borderlands 2\u2019s overwhelmingly silly sense of humor. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a yarn worth hearing, one that ropes you in and makes you feel like what you\u2019re doing has purpose \u2013 something the original game never really achieved. The main story\u2019s good, but the best writing in Borderlands 2 comes from the side quests. If you played and enjoyed things like the General Knoxx or Claptrap DLC from the first game, then you\u2019ll be in for a real treat throughout Borderlands 2\u2019s more than 30 hours of game time. Each time the main story starts to slow down, you\u2019re almost always given a number of sidequests to jump into. Mechanically they don\u2019t do anything all that different from typical RPG \u201ckill this\u201d or \u201ccollect that\u201d fodder quests, but the writing, presentation, and acting turn them into some of the most memorable content the game has to offer. For instance one mission has you fighting off a \u201csplinter group\u201d of ninja-like bandits who just so happen to live in a sewer, eat pizza and talk like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Another side quest tasks you with collecting body parts for a robot who wants to become human, and his take on humanity, as well as the way he talks, turns into genuine comedy. Not many games manage to make me literally laugh out loud, but Borderlands 2\u2019s mixture of gutter humor and sharp wit did so repeatedly. Even when I had far out-leveled the sidequest content I couldn\u2019t help but return to it, lest I miss out on something awesome. Similarly to how the sidequests build upon the writing Gearbox became known for with the first game\u2019s DLC, Borderlands 2 also expands upon other parts of the game in smaller, but still significant ways. From more options to how you sort missions, to easy ways to mark and sell loot, to an always present mini-map, the entire interface is simply a lot more user friendly and intuitive. Sadly, though, little has been done to improve the driving component of the series. Outside of a few quests that require you to use a car, the vehicles feel largely underutilized and not all that valuable outside of getting you to destinations a lot quicker. Borderlands 2 is a shooter first and foremost, but it\u2019d be awesome to see smarter mission design that takes advantage of them in, say, the way Halo does with its vehicle levels. Even so, they offer a change of pace from the rest of the game\u2019s shoot and loot cycle. If thirty hours of what I\u2019ve described doesn\u2019t seem like enough, Borderlands 2 provides plenty of reasons to play it again and again. All four of the classes are a lot of fun to play, and even after you finish the campaign there\u2019s always the option to try out Vault Hunter Mode, which is essentially a second playthrough where you get to keep your loot and levels. Even after you hit the cap of 50 you can fight the game\u2019s first four-person raid boss. With the promise of DLC on the horizon, which Gearbox did a great job with the first time around, I know I\u2019ll be coming back to Borderlands 2 again. When it comes to what platform you should play on\u2026well, it doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. Get Borderlands 2 on PS3, 360 or PC and you\u2019ll experience the exact same content. All of them have the same story, the same skill trees and the same minor issues with texture pop-in. During my playthrough bugs would also occasionally pop up. Typically this involved enemies or objects getting stuck in the world, and in one case this resulted in the need to completely restart a boss fight. Since they happen so randomly, though, it\u2019s hard to say whether or not these will occur during your playthrough, or whether they\u2019ll even occur on all platforms. Still, they were more than a little annoying, and really broke me out of the experience sometimes. The one thing worth pointing out between the various platforms is how cool Borderlands 2 can look if you have an awesome PC. The PC version allows plenty of tweaks to draw distance, frame rate and more. It also allows Nvidia card users to turn on Physx options, which results in a hell of a lot more particles flying around, realistic liquid physics, and a greater sense of destructible environments. Ultimately I don\u2019t feel this is something console gamers will miss, but for those of you with great hardware it\u2019s an additional thing to enjoy. Just be warned: it\u2019s very, very resource intensive.  *Notice the new review look? Find out how and why we made the changes right here , and tell us what you think!"

        "Content": "Harley Quinn's Revenge takes place after the ending of Batman: Arkham City . This article mentions how the game ends. I've already declared that Harley Quinn's Revenge is what downloadable content should be based on a 30-minute preview of the single-player story expansion for Batman: Arkham City. Luckily, after playing through the entire two-hour campaign, I'm not going to try and weasel out of that statement. Although I wish the ending was a bit more satisfying, that's nitpicking. Harley Quinn's Revenge offers a fresh take on the gameplay we love and expands the narrative developer Rocksteady has worked so hard to create. This is the type of DLC story-driven games should be pumping out. Picking up a few weeks after the events of Batman: Arkham City, Harley Quinn's Revenge opens with Batman missing. Seems Harley took over the Joker's old haunt in Arkham City, Batman went to investigate, and now the Caped Crusader hasn't been heard from in days. As such, we start as Robin investigating the scene, jump back to Batman to see what went wrong, and then flip flop to tell the tale. This is the type of DLC story-driven games should be pumping out. \u201c Needless to say, that's rad. Harley's DLC is familiar but fresh. Robin's moves (his bo staff becomes a shield, he can grapple to people's chest for a zip kick, etc.) are the same from his downloadable challenge missions, but this is our first chance to try them out in a story situation. We get to hear Robin talk to Oracle, see him use detective vision, and become Batman's savior. That's a nice shakeup after dozens of hours patrolling rooftops and looking for Riddler trophies as the Dark Knight. Make no mistake, this is the same gameplay I lauded back in October with its reversal system, combos and gadgets, but viewing it through this new lens makes it exciting all over again. Using a shuriken instead of a Batarang is a bigger deal than you might think, and as someone who hadn't really played since the game came out, I enjoyed slipping back into the game I loved so much. It was like seeing an old friend again.  But it's worth pointing out that you can't ignore the mission at hand here and go scope the city for side quests as the Boy Wonder. Harley Quinn's Revenge is a standalone mode off the main menu and doesn't tie into your previous saves or the open world, although it does have a collectable set of Harley balloons to find and a bunch of new Trophies/Achievements. The missions you'll tackle drop you right back into taking out snipers and wailing on guys with stun guns, but they can be a bit fetch questy, focusing on collecting keycards and defusing bombs. Still, I never got sick of heading out on the next leg of my journey because the enemies are always varied. Even though I'm taking on room after room of guys as I make my way around the steel mill, Harley Quinn's Revenge tweaked the formula with each group. Switching out the enemy types is great, but the continuation of the Arkham City story kept me playing and justifies the purchase. Challenge rooms and costumes are enticing to some gamers, but I wanted to know what happened to these characters after Batman walked out of that theater with Joker's dead body. To pick up here and find the Dark Knight's friends concerned about him emotionally -- as if he's grieving for the Joker -- is alarming and intriguing all at once. Batman's always been unhinged, so how crazy is he now that his partners are this concerned for him? However, that question is the DLC's major downside. It's never answered. We're teased with the information that Batman is struggling with the loss of his arch nemesis and his lover Talia, but we never get to see it. We never get to see him deal with it. I'm not going to spoil the ending here, but don't expect to have any more closure than you did before. In fact, this might even raise more questions for Batman's character than the original Arkham City ending. But that's not the worst thing in the world -- just something for us fans to obsess over until the next game, piece of DLC or comic book chapter .

        "Content": "It's always possible to innovate within a comfortable and well-established template. Nintendo is traditionally the master of this art, secreting gems of novelty within game designs that are often a decade or two old, perfected through years of iteration. Just because a game conforms in many respects to the conventions of its genre, that doesn't mean it can't do anything new, and it certainly doesn't mean that it can't be wonderful.  So yes, in Xenoblade Chronicles , you play an orphaned young hero who, for reasons unexplained, is the only one capable of saving the world from a mysterious evil. (He doesn't have amnesia, though, thankfully.) Yes, there is an ultimate weapon with untold power. Yes, you wander a giant world in a party of three, following a story punctuated by enough cutscene to make the Godfather Trilogy look comparatively brisk. But this is also one of the freshest and most innovative Japanese RPGs of the past decade. It feels more modern than anything else in its genre.  You see, although Xenoblade Chronicles honours many positive JRPG traditions, it's not afraid to dispense with other, more tedious ones. It's impressively non-linear, letting you wander from the story to explore its gorgeous world, toddling off in search of side-quests and extra-mean monsters to kill and caves to loot. It has fast-travel. Its story, which initially seems a little predictable, is actually a deep and varied tale that spans some 60-odd hours without ever feeling painfully drawn out. There are no random battles and the combat system is brilliant, a mix of real-time and command-based fighting that feels like an updated Final Fantasy XII mixed with a splash of White Knight Chronicles' chain system.    The game world is littered with two things: shiny collectibles to nab for loot and questing, and wandering animals that can be either engaged in battle or safely ignored \u2013 unless they're particularly aggressive. Get in the way of a Level 74 troll on your way to an oasis and you'll be flattened in seconds, but you can practice your team combos on relatively docile animals and then strip their corpses for loot to sell or use later. Everything, from exploration to item-collecting to battle victories, earns experience points that strengthen your team. Side quests are totally optional, but you'd be a fool to pass them by. They give you an excuse for forays into the furthest corners of the map, letting you fully absorb the scale of this adventure.  When you're not following the story, Xenoblade Chronicles is equal parts fighting and exploration. Once in a battle, basic attacks happen automatically, but those won't get you far. Keeping control of one character in the party, you select from an ever-widening selection of Talents \u2013 special moves, essentially \u2013 that recharge over time. Let the party tank draw all the monster aggro, and you can get behind them for a deadly backstab. Knock a monster off balance, and another party member will smash it to the floor with another appropriate move. Occasionally, mini-QTEs let you cause a bit of extra damage, earning plaudits from your team-mates. It's fast-paced, tactical and really engaging.  You're constantly working together with everyone else on the battlefield, watching to see what they do and reacting dynamically, guiding them on what to target and when to run away. Work in harmony with teammates for long enough and you can unleash a chain attack, matching Talents from each character to devastating effect \u2013 the only way to cause significant damage to the biggest, baddest beasties. It's always possible to dash off and regroup if you find yourself in a tough skirmish (unless it's a boss battle). But dying in itself isn't really a problem; you simply reappear at the last landmark you passed, all loot, health and stats intact.  But it's the weapon at the centre of Xenoblade Chronicles' story, the Monado, that really gives the battle system its edge. The Monado is an ancient weapon that gives its wielder, the aforementioned gifted orphan, the ability to see the future. In cutscenes, this is a great plot device; young Shulk, our hero, spends much of the story struggling with his ability to see the future and his inability to change it. For every time one of his visions enabled him to save the life of a valued friend, there's another occasion where nothing he can do makes a difference.    In battle, though, the power of the Monado lets you see a devastating attack before it happens, giving you a stylish warning. The screen greys out and the action quickly turns to slow motion, showing a boss cutting through your party with a deadly special move; you then have some time to warn your teammates, putting up a magic shield, getting them out of the way or incapacitating the enemy, allowing you to change the future and keep on fighting. It's a dramatic-looking and well-implemented feature, and innovative too.  A lot of Xenoblade's appeal comes from its unique world. Essentially, it's set on the fossilised bodies of two giant robots (stay with me), who were locked in an eternal battle until time finally took its toll, freezing them in place. One of these robots, the Bionis, is colonised by humans who live on expansive patches of fertile land across the titan's frozen limbs. Look out across the scenery, and you see greenery and fauna stretching out into the distance; look up at the sky, and you can make out the shape of gigantic robotic arms jutting out above you. It's a breathtaking setting, one that allows for amazing, natural outdoor environments as well as indoor caverns and structures with a sci-fi tinge.   The other fossilised titan is home to menacing, evil robots, the Mechon, who have recently taken to descending upon the human colonies and eating the inhabitants. The plot initially centres on the battle against this invading force, fought by young Shulk and his fellow survivors from Colony 9. There's actually rather a lot of gore and drama in Xenoblade, despite its rather cuddly looks. The first high-profile grisly death occurs about three hours in and it's definitely not the last. It's hardly Dragon Age 2, admittedly, but it doesn't shy away from violence and death.  Despite this gorgeous setting, though, there are many, many moments where you'll wish that Xenoblade Chronicles was running on a more powerful console. There's no denying that it looks like a game from four or five years ago. Character textures are fuzzy, there's a lot of clipping and only the far-reaching outdoor environments truly impress. It's amazing how quickly you get used to it, but the Wii really struggles to do justice to the game's excellent artistic direction. It's also a real shame that nobody bothered to lip-sync the English dialogue, which mars the otherwise very good localisation.    It's testament to the game's quality that it still draws you in so deeply. There's more imagination evident in the monster and environment designs than in most entire JRPG epics of the past five years or so. And brilliantly, because Xenoblade Chronicles has been localised for Europe, the voice acting is all charmingly British-accented. Shulk sounds like he's just come out of finishing school, his best mate Reyn sounds like a plucky Londoner, and other characters contribute accents from Yorkshireman to Welsh. Only the Especially Evil Robot Bad Guys miss the mark with their way-over-the-top Cockerney guffawing, which makes them sound like robot Cockney pirates. (Which, come to think, is pretty cool in itself.)  The likeable voice acting makes it easier to form lasting relationships with the characters, who are better-written and more believable than most. Their relationships with each other really make sense; rather than a band of random people thrown together by circumstance, your party really feels like a band of brothers (and sisters). They talk constantly during battles, encouraging each other and yelling awesomely British battle calls (\"Get stuck in!\" \"Nice one mate!\" \"Come off it!\"). If anything, they talk too much, but at least they're not the sterile pretty boys that we've come to expect from Japanese RPGs.  That's what's really at the core of Xenoblade Chronicles' brilliance: it defies your expectations. After the corridors of FF XIII, the openness of this world is a revelation, as is the unselfconscious plotting. It's got a lot of action and some moments that pack an emotional punch, but none of the pompousness and melodrama of less accomplished Japanese epics. I'd forgotten that JRPGs could be anything other than depressingly linear and a heavily over-written; we've grown to accept it as a feature of the genre, one we have to live with. Xenoblade Chronicles shows us that things don't have to be this way, that there's still room for innovation in this struggling genre.    There's so much more to this game that I could tell you. I could talk about the gem crafting, skill trees, talent arts and myriad collectibles that deepen the experience \u2013 things that are there to play with if you want, but that don't bog down the game in reams of detail. I could talk about the thoughtful little touches that make it such a pleasure to play, like the ability to fast-travel and the comprehensive but easy to understand inventory system and the story memos that give you a gentle, optional reminder of where you have to go and why.  It's a proper epic, too, with hour-and-a-half long boss battles that take place in several parts, more than 50 hours of story, and an abundance of side-quests. It keeps your attention throughout by offering such a selection of things to do, never forcing you along a rigid story path."

        "Content": "Extreme sports games died in the mid-2000s. They were a relic of last generation's ideals, a fleeting memory of joy that developers couldn't capture again. Then SSX rose from the dead in the most spectacular fashion, like Lazarus busting a 1080 nosegrab.  For the fifth canon installment in the SSX series (the Wii's SSX Blur doesn't count, apparently), EA Canada went all out in every aspect, bringing back familiar faces for their most epic adventure yet. Not that SSX needed a riveting story to get you into the idea of snowboarding around the world, but the plot revolves around team SSX trying to conquer the nine Deadly Descents (the most dangerous mountains in the world). Problem is, one of their former team members, Griff, claims he's going to do it first. Oh hell no. So it's a race to beat the douchey prettyboy to the mountains.    Whether you're carving through broken sections of the Great Wall of China, or leaping off of abandoned nuclear reactors, SSX never fails to excite. Every mountain range exudes an awesomely unique vibe, playing off the region's features. It takes skill and well-timed jumps to dodge the broken aircraft and steep, deadly cliffs of Patagonia. Grinding along Alaska's pipelines turns a normal snowboarding track into a rollercoaster. Every area in SSX provides an amazing, exhilarating ride. Even the \"love it or hate it\" ranges, like the dark mazes of Africa or the icy deathtraps in Siberia, are breathtaking trips.  The core of SSX has, since Tricky at least, been about pulling incredible, over the top tricks, and this SSX has that in abundance. Both the stick and button controls work extremely well, allowing you to pull off dozens of tricks in a row with complete ease. The real skill comes in keeping that combo up, an absolutely crucial strategy for getting those high scores (which generally lie in the 15-20 million point range). For the SSX enthusiasts, the classic controls are available too, though they seem more like a favor to fans than something you'd want to play with for some of the more difficult tracks.  Hitting the same tracks in a Race event, instead of a trick run, can change your entire strategy of the course, forcing you to find the fastest lines instead of the biggest air. And every course features multiple branching paths, hidden tunnels, and dangerous canyons, requiring expert precision to get those best scores. And sometimes just to survive.   You won't see this sh#$ at the Winter X Games.  SSX's newest component, the Survive It courses, test your ability to not eat it and die. Each of the nine mountain ranges feature a Deadly Descent, a mountain so dangerous that you need special gear to even ride it. It's here where things like the wingsuit come into play. While the other featured gear is nowhere near as exciting as the wingsuit (oh sweet, I get a headlamp?!), all of the actual Survive It events try to kill you in the most exciting ways possible. Giant avalanches try and swallow you up, freezing cold temperatures and lack of oxygen will suck the life from you, jagged rocks and trees threaten to crush your bones. So yeah, no sweat.  Throughout the entire game, RiderNet keeps track of your progress. Anyone who has played the last few Need for Speed games will recognize RiderNet as an Autolog-inspired online resource. From the second you load up SSX, RiderNet alerts you about what your friends are doing. Any scores posted or collectibles acquired pop up, and the game sets challenges for you based on your friend's scores.  Multiplayer in SSX comes in the form of Global Events, a constantly updating series of challenges open to everyone in the world (or just you and your buds). EA has challenges going all the time, and you can just drop in and try and post a high score or fast time. As you're racing along a course, other players doing the same show up alongside you in a crazy simultaneous event. For some, the lack of traditional multiplayer is a problem, but with the custom events that let you invite only your friends, you can get near that experience. Plus the Global Events and RiderNet combine to open up multiplayer in a much broader and more modern way that allows you to play SSX at your own speed and on your schedule, while still keeping that competitive edge with your friends.    What's a snowboarding game without a dope soundtrack, right? SSX goes hard with a lot of drum and bass from The Qemists. Skrillex provides the obligatory dubstep madness.  Noisia's uptempo electronica is rad. Bands like Foster the People and The Naked and Famous represent the whiteboy rock contingent. And it's all accented by a Pretty Lights remix of Run-DMC's \"It's Tricky\" whenever you get your combo up. But what really makes the soundtrack so cool is that SSX auto remixes the songs as you race, and this works when you load your own music into the game as well."

        "Content": "From the moment you first log in, Star Wars: The Old Republic puts you in the mindset of a star-hopping badass. The opening cinematic, where the Sith appear out of nowhere and reclaim Korriban, introduces you to the conflict between the Empire and the Republic. Then you choose which faction you're going to play for, and another cinematic sets the tone of your alignment. For Empire players, the focus is on power, control, and anger. The Republic cinematic portrays a need to take back what's lost through planning and tenacity.  The cinematics are spectacularly compelling and make me wish Blur, the creators, were contracted to do a feature-length film.  Then you're kicked back to a menu screen to create your character. The creator is quite flexible, with a wide range of customization options unique to each race, but you're limited only to strictly humanoid races and a few rather similar body sizes (males at least get a \"fat\" option \u2013 female characters don't even get that). For a universe with a vast number of established intelligent races of all shapes and sizes, this feels limited. You can't, for example, play as a Jawa or a droid. In the grand scheme of things, it's a minor annoyance though.    The classic scrolling yellow text of the films begins immediately after you've created your character, accompanied by the Star Wars theme. There is, in my mind, no better way BioWare could have kicked off your adventure. The text briefly explains who you are and in what context you're entering the galaxy. It's unique to each class and, along with the cinematic that follows, sets you on your way to making a name for yourself. This is where inexperienced players will hit a figurative force-field.   The Old Republic Wiki Guide Starter Guide Datacron Locations Classes & Skill Builder Easter Eggs Quests Guide Send us your tips \u00bb Tweet us your tips \u00bb The Old Republic has no structured tutorial. Rather, there's a tip system that offers help about an aspect of gameplay whenever the context calls for it. In any other MMO, that would probably suffice, but the moment you set foot in The Old Republic you are faced with quest-givers, future quest-givers with grey quest icons, class-specific story areas that you can't enter, vendors, dialogue trees, half a dozen abilities and hostile NPCs who will attack on sight. That's a whole lot to take in within the span of about five minutes, and while many of the systems that The Old Republic uses are familiar to MMO players, I can't help but think how overwhelmed I was by my first MMO, and just how much more The Old Republic throws at the you from the get-go.  But BioWare gives you an incentive to get over that initial hump by giving you a sense of purpose and the opportunity to breathe personality into your character. In the amount of time it takes to get through the first dialogue bit, you may be tempted to proudly announce to anyone nearby that you're \"the most evil Sith ever,\" or \"a Bounty Hunter with a heart of gold and an eye for credits.\" From there, BioWare gives you hundreds more opportunities to reinforce your identity (or flip-flop entirely).  This makes learning the complex game systems feel like more of a side-effect of role-playing your character than a requirement to move forward.  The complex game systems won't seem so complex if you've played an MMO in the last decade. Combat is based around selecting a target and using an ability to attack it. The Old Republic sets itself apart from many MMOs by removing the auto-attack that initiates when your character is set to beat up a target. Instead, each class has a basic attack that has to be activated manually whenever you want to use it. It requires no class resource, and in the case of the Jedi Knight and the Sith Warrior it actually helps build the resource, somewhat similar to Rage for the warrior class in World of Warcraft.   This quest on Voss is one of the best on offer.  I'm not a huge fan of the system. While it does away with the passive gameplay of the auto-attack, it introduces the problem of forcing you to fill every gap between cooldowns with a basic attack, and to constantly pepper it into every attack rotation. The attack doesn't do anything unique \u2013 even the Knight and Warrior get other abilities that add just as much resource \u2013 and the damage scales with gear at the same rate as other abilities, except abilities get significant bonus damage and usually a secondary function. For some classes the basic attack might trigger another ability, but invariably there are other abilities that act as triggers as well. So the sole purpose of the basic attack is to add a slight amount of damage to gaps in an attack rotation, or to give you something to do while you wait for your class resource to regenerate.  It doesn't make for more fun gameplay in the long run and just means you'll be pushing a single key a whole lot.  While it can get a little annoying having to babysit a single button that doesn't add any true depth, the rest of the skill set makes up for it. The nature of the Advanced Class system means that two very different style of character will share many of the same skills, but by virtue of the skills they don't share, they function in wildly different ways. The best example of this is the Sith Sorcerer, a ranged damage dealer/healer versus the Sith Assassin, a melee damage dealer/tank capable of going into stealth. They both split from the Inquisitor, so they both have Overload, which knocks nearby enemies back. As a Sorcerer the skill is a powerful means of getting some distance on an attacker, while an Assassin can use it from stealth to completely disorient an enemy player or get them way out of position.  While these abilities certainly do their job against an AI-controlled enemy, against a player in one of The Old Republic's Warzones is where they really shine. This is true especially of Huttball, a deranged version of American football mixed with rugby, with acid pools and plumes of fire scattered across a multi-level arena, is the most original and compelling PvP map I've seen. It's the only map that currently allows two teams of the same faction to fight against each other, so for servers with population imbalances it's also the most frequently played of the three Warzones and according to in-game chat and forums, people are getting sick of it. I'm not one of those people. Huttball's emphasis on teamwork, communication, planning and clever use of the environment set it apart from Voidstar and Alderaan's emphasis on straightforward combat.    Regardless of the Warzone, The Old Republic has a brilliant method of making every class role viable. In traditional PvP, tanky characters \u2013 usually a central part of PvE group combat encounters \u2013 become little more than a free, albeit slow, kill for damage-dealing classes, or a flag-carrier in capture-the-flag modes. It's the only role in PvP that has traditionally struggled to find its niche. In The Old Republic, besides being excellent Huttball-carriers, tanks are able to redirect an ally's damage to them and reduce the damage an enemy deals to everyone but the tank himself. This can make a massive difference to the lifespan of squishier characters and makes tanks an important part of a solid team's makeup.  The Old Republic takes note of the reduced and redirected damage in the background, along with the amount of damage each player deals and heals, the number of kills they are involved in, and how often they are involved in attacking and defending objectives, and allocates Badges to players whenever they reach a certain threshold throughout the match. Badges are turned into one of the game's many currencies at the end of the match, rewarding those who contributed to a battle. In my experience, the system rewards performance well, and I've only seen one person standing idle in dozens and dozens of matches, which to me reflects that the Badge system is effective at encouraging players to participate instead of trying to rack up the meager default rewards.   Early speeders look like giant noses and lawn-mowers. The later ones look much nicer.  Class roles in PvE group encounters are much more simplistic, and the encounters themselves \u2013 at least prior to the level cap \u2013 fairly standard. The more interesting ones take place primarily in Flashpoints, which are instanced and heavily scripted. The first Flashpoint for each faction is a particularly excellent showcase of BioWare's signature branching storylines. Later Flashpoints don't emphasize story as strongly and play more akin to instances in other games, which makes repeated runs less exciting.  That's not a big deal, though, because you'll get plenty of storytelling through questing. The quality of the story is very good \u2013 you get opportunities to threaten, extort, maim and murder, or be totally nice and live and let live. Light and dark side options spring up regularly, and occasionally foregoing the obvious light or dark side choice early on in a conversation will reveal an extra opportunity. Force-alignment is mostly cosmetic (you can get equal or better gear through different avenues) but can influence what your companions, AI-controlled allies who aid you in battle, think of you.   Companions are essentially pets from other MMOs, but with more abilities. They also each have a full set of gear slots, so they can be customized almost as much as you can. They grow to love or hate you (mostly love, though) based on your choices in conversation. As their affection grows, you unlock quests which give you some insights into their character. I like that the system exists, but its execution is pretty lackluster from what I've seen. I courted one of my companions up to the maximum amount of affection and completed her chain of quests, and was rewarded with a few awkward kissing sequences and an a couple items in the mail.  But at least the vocal performances were good. In fact, the voice-acting throughout The Old Republic is consistently strong, a true feat considering just how much of it there is. Each quest giver exudes personality in just a few sentences, and the tasks they dole out to you usually make sense in the context of the setting. You want me to disable mines along that road? Of course you do! It's a battlefield!    The quests themselves don't really deviate from the kill-and-collect affair that MMOs have come to be known (and often maligned) for, they're just wrapped up in a much more appealing skin. Collecting mines with interesting context is still just collecting mines. Most quests have several phases and it's not always necessary to return to the quest-giver between phases. Instead, the next part of the quest will just open up, often pushing you deeper into enemy territory, giving you the sense that this is a complex, multi-tiered military operation and not just something some guys wants you to do. A lot of quests end with an encounter with a strong enemy, which makes the whole process feel like a mini dungeon run.  Whether you're questing, running Flashpoints or PvPing, like other MMOs in this vein, the ultimate goal is to acquire better gear. Gear floods towards you at an almost constant rate. Quests usually give you several item choices, and PvP throws commendations at you like crazy. Each questing planet also supplies you with commendations, which can be traded in for a totally sweet tattoo. Just kidding! They'll give you more gear. Certain item types can have their stats completely modified, which means if you are particularly fond of the look of an item you can feasibly hold onto it indefinitely.  Because companions have their own set of gear slots, you'll also have plenty of places to put all the items you get. If you love chasing better gear (and who doesn't?) then The Old Republic will leave you satisfied.   High-level gear cements each class's visual style nicely.  The visual appearance of the gear \u2013 arguably the most important reason to even get it in the first place \u2013 is very loyal to the Star Wars source material. Bounty Hunter gear harkens back to all sorts of famous characters without ever copying them exactly, and Inquisitor and Warrior gear is appropriately dark and ominous. Jedi have robes. They're brown!  Most of The Old Republic's settings share the same loyalty. Nar Shaddaa is a sleazy Las Vegas in space, Taris, a ruined, war-torn and now overgrown world. Tattooine is appropriately sandy and dome-filled, and Hoth is as frozen-over as you'd expect it to be. Actually, there are a lot of snowy planets. They should consider sending some of that ice to Tattooine. While the layout of some of these planets makes getting around tiresome at times, often broken-up and unreachable by any means but a taxi, it's never so bad that you'd rather abandon your task and grind a level out somewhere else.  The stand-out planet for me was Voss, not because of aesthetics or layout, but because it contained a few of the most interesting quests in the entire game. That, and the Voss race is just very cool.    Some games suffer from a lack of content at launch. The Old Republic is not one of those games. If anything, there is too much content, with most planets containing entire bonus-sets of quests for players who want to stay there a little while longer. Between questing, PvP and ship combat (which is disappointingly simplistic once you get over the nice visuals) there will never be a time prior to the level cap of 50 when you have nothing to do. And even once you hit the level cap, hard modes of old Flashpoints open up, as do Operations (Flashpoints for larger groups). There's also the planet of Ilum, a hybrid PvP/PvE location that supplies some nice rewards.  Unfortunately, quite a lot of the latter-half of the leveling curve is plagued with bugs. Most are cosmetic \u2013 weird cinematics, attack animations lingering endlessly \u2013 but every now and then you'll hit a nasty one, like instantly dying after using a transport or getting stuck and becoming unable to move (even after using the unstuck command) indefinitely. Patches have become more frequent than they were initially, but there are still a lot of issues floating around weeks after opening up public access.  There are several aspects I haven't mentioned here, and others that I didn't go into great detail for, that I have in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Review Journal . If you want more detail about any aspect of the game, or just want to kill some time between Warzones, please check it out ."

        "Content": "Battlefield 3 suffers from an identity crisis.  It delivers scorching multiplayer, fitting of its decade-long pedigree of famously expansive big-team battles, but stumbles over a generic single-player campaign that feels like a different game.  While DICE may not deliver a memorable story here, it doesn't need to when Battlefield 3's online warfare raises every bar imaginable, delivering one of the best multiplayer experiences of the year. I doubt Battlefield purists will complain much about the campaign, honestly; I know you're enlisting in this battle to bring down entire armies online.   Editor's Note: This review covers PC only. Click here for Xbox 360 or here for PlayStation 3 .     From the beaches of Kharg Island to the hills of Damavand Peak, Battlefield 3's multiplayer maps provide an immediate sense of scale. Everything about their design screams size, personalization, and the need to take creative initiative to succeed. Choose to pop headshots from the prone position, spin barrel rolls in a jet outfitted with personal unlocks, or see how many dog tags you can knife from your opponents; Battlefield 3's multiplayer is about the freedom of choice.  The online fight feels like a geography lesson (in a good way). Depending on the game mode, each map utilizes a different area or shifts wider and wider as gameplay progresses. You might not see half of a map like Caspian Border or Seine Crossing during your first few Rush matches. Yes, certain areas feel empty and repeated map elements like shipping crates conjure deja vu, but the sense of scope is exhilarating. Where many online shooters teach you the nooks and crannies of every map, Battlefield 3 is a wide sandbox that encourages variety and exploration. Battlefield 3 shines in matches with 63 other players, where every bullet has a new enemy's name on it.   Running to the front lines.  Is the gameplay balanced? Battlefield 3's online teeter-totter comes down to personal preference. I've been pinned down at my spawn point in Operation Metro by a dozen, well-stocked snipers and I've taken over an entire conquest map single-handedly. I'm no Maverick in a jet, so I learned to rain down hellfire from a chopper. For any class or tactic that doesn't work, like a painter's palette, Battlefield 3 offers alternatives. All four streamlined classes (Soldier, Engineer, Assault, and Recon) get their own problem-solving unlocks, so leveling each one is paramount to sitting on top of the leaderboards.  Battlefield 3's rewards and progression will keep you coming back to its online rumble for a long time. From adding heat-seeking missiles to an Anti-Aircraft Tank to simply changing camouflage, there's always a carrot dangling just out of reach -- if you can wrangle the score to earn it. While the newly implemented Team Deathmatch modes encourage high kills and low deaths, Battlefield remains a team-based game where you can sit atop the scoreboard no matter how many times you've died. Heal an injured teammate, resupply a sniper, or make sure a tank gets fixed up, Battlefield is about working towards the greater good and it's just as refreshing now as it was in 2002 -- all while looking outstanding on PC.   From sun flares to smoke bursting from a collapsing building, Battlefield 3's Frostbite 2 engine provides marvelous visuals. It performs admirably on lowered settings, but for anyone who's doubled up on their NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580s, Battlefield 3 provides a gorgeous spectrum of environments speckled with detail to brag about. Nighttime elements present a stark intensity, with glowing fluorescent signs dotting the cityscape and street lights blinding you from seeing enemies. The waves crashing on a beach below a late-game villa are mesmerizing -- as is the simple scrub brush dotting maps like Operation Firestorm. At maximum settings, Battlefield 3 looks stunning.   Nighttime provides stark contrasts.  The engine isn't perfect by any means. I encountered prone legs jutting through walls, saw snipers half-buried in mountainsides, watched my dead body stick through the hood of a jeep, and even noticed a story character float in a straight line from point A to point B, walls be damned. I've seen flower pots float in midair, noticed AI soldiers in their shooting position long after death, and I somehow committed suicide by running over the lip of a crater. These glitches are annoying, but they don't break the game. But they do break the immersion of the story and in the case of an undeserved multiplayer suicide, cause unneeded frustration.  While longtime fans know Battlefield as a multiplayer experience, its campaign and cooperative experiences can't be ignored. For those of you more interested in the single-player campaign than multiplayer, definitely take note. Whereas both Battlefield: Bad Company games added a story underwritten with humor, Battlefield 3 takes a more serious path. Its tale of global threats reads like twenty years of military fiction thrown in a blender and turned into a checklist. WMDs? Check. Russians? Uh huh. Insurgents tucked into Middle Eastern alleyways? Yup. It's all there and woven into levels through the recollections of Sergeant James Blackburn during an interrogation (didn't we see this in Call of Duty: Black Ops?). There's inherent tension in the threat of a terrorist attack, but Battlefield 3's campaign feels like well-trodden ground.   In campaign, you can't fly 'em.  Battlefield 3's campaign does hit some memorable moments (especially in the graphics department), but as a whole it's trite and frustrating. The campaign jams Battlefield 3's multiplayer into a linear box where freedom of choice gets thrown out a non-destructible window. There are only a few buildings to blow holes in, barely any vehicles to take the wheel of, and quicktime events adorn enemy encounters in almost every level. While you can literally crash a helicopter on an opponent's head while parachuting to safety if you so choose in multiplayer, campaign makes you hit spacebar at just the right moment to avoid getting punched -- they're two different games.  The co-op missions surround the events of the campaign, yet feel more enjoyable as individual levels. Working with a teammate leads to more creative approaches of attacks, though the same AI frustrations are in place. While opening doors and during other set animations, AI enemies gain invulnerability. They also have an uncanny ability to pick you out of the crowd. Even while using an AI teammate as cover -- not standard operating procedure, I know -- enemies still find you.

Whether it's a grenade exploding without an indicator, a blast from an unseen enemy, or late-game quicktime event that introduces a new button, the campaign and co-op levels are a minefield of frustration -- especially when cranking the difficulty up to hard. All told, it's a brief affair -- I burned through the single-player portion in under six hours, the co-op content adds another two or three."

        "Content": "From the makers of 2009's insane motorcycle-flipping spectacle Trials HD comes even more insanity, only this time we're flipping four-wheeled buggies instead of two-wheeled bikes. MotoHeroz is a crazy, kooky-looking, physics-based, half-racing/half-platforming blast of a game -- the kind of follow-up that would feel perfectly positioned on Xbox Live Arcade right alongside its spiritual predecessor. The thing is, this one's only available on Wii.  Only available on Wii Ware , to be specific, as developer RedLynx is distributing this great product exclusively through Nintendo's otherwise almost entirely forgotten digital download shop. The price is set at a premium -- 15 bucks, the same amount only previously demanded by World of Goo . This is a pretty bold move. Goo, after all, has repeatedly been named the best WiiWare download of all and has earned the right to demand a little something extra.  MotoHeroz, though, is more than capable of competing on that same level. This title is packed with features, extra content, a great presentation, stunning music . . . in short, it's good. So let's take a closer look under the hood.   Bumpin' and jumpin'.  Gene McQuick is the name of the newest rookie to challenge the worldwide racing tournament being held across the globe of the planet Gema. Under your command he'll have to speed his way through dozens of different courses, each of them filled with wild obstacles like huge leaps, loop-de-loops, breakaway bridges and even sci-fi teleporters. Along the way he'll also have to collect coins, post faster times than ghostly competitors and real-world rivals and even commune with the spirits of his long-lost ancestors. Spooky!  The mechanics of MotoHeroz are introduced to us as Gene is learning the ropes himself. The basics to master are your speed and your angle relative to the ground. Just as in Trials HD (or even going back as far as Nintendo's first Excitebike ), you'll find yourself frequently flying through the air and must match the angle of your wheels with the surface you're about to land on in order to maintain momentum.  Succeed and your speed is preserved, ensuring continued fast progress toward the goal. Fail and you may find Gene flailing helplessly upside-down on the ground (and you'll have to shake the Wii Remote to flip him back over and try again).  The physics are handled beautifully, as RedLynx has clearly brought a practiced knowledge into the programming of MotoHeroz's many bouncing buggies. But, as with any game boasting realistic physics, the reality of it all can sometimes get the best of you.   Hitting high gear.  Just the slightest error can make the difference between victory and defeat in MotoHeroz. Because the physics are so precise, they're sometimes unforgiving -- meaning if you don't clear a jump just right you'll fall backwards, Gene will topple over himself and you'll probably have to restart the level.  What's more, sometimes the cars seem to just flip out of control at entirely arbitrary times -- which, again, can lead you to just being slightly off for your next landing, forcing another failure upon you. When you've seen Gene land on his face 10, 15 or 20 times in a row while your ghost-racer competitor happily speeds along without incident, things get frustrating.  Luckily that issue is really the only one MotoHeroz has, and it can be overcome with patience and practice. You'll come to understand (the hard way) that just hammering on the accelerator won't get you to the goal here. It takes a lighter touch. Small adjustments. Subtle shifts in speed.  And all that's just dealing with your default car taking on the environment. MotoHeroz ups the ante quickly to include other complicated elements to take into account, too, like collectible power-up items -- things like nitro boosts to propel your ride up otherwise too-steep hills, springs to trigger on-the-spot jumps and even sticky tires that let your buggy become a temporary Spider-Man across any surface. The single-player challenge ends up being a varied and satisfying romp with solid replay value and a lot of fun (after you get past that physics-system learning curve).   Going out of this world.  The real meat of MotoHeroz comes in its multiplayer, though. Flipping out with one buggy on the screen seems tame once you've jumped into the four-way race mode here, as everyone takes up their own Remote and commands their own car simultaneously in the stage. The physics are still active and accurate, so you're constantly colliding with, bouncing off of and just driving straight over your friends in a mad dash to the end point.  It's hilarious fun, a pure and very Nintendo-like good time. One of Rich's comments from his hands-on time with this game back at GDC this year was that if he didn't know better, he would have thought this game came straight from the Big N, and I agree wholeheartedly. There's that special, intangible \"something\" that you feel when you're playing a great first-party multiplayer game from Nintendo, and MotoHeroz somehow manages to tap into that magic.  The rest of the package is incredibly robust as well. There are daily online challenges that RedLynx is rotating through -- seriously, every day there's something different -- and there are leaderboards keeping track of both worldwide best times and the fastest finishes put up by your own friends. There are extra cars to buy and use that each have different ratings for grip, weight and handling that all look great.  There's even available DLC called the \"MotoHeroz Party Pack\" that expands everything even further. You'll have to invest some more cash to get it, which is never anyone's favorite thing to do, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the game. For your initial investment of 1500 Wii Points, the experience feels very complete even without the extra purchase."

        "Content": "Gears of War 3 knows exactly what it is: a badass simulator. Developer Epic Games strives to bookend the Gears trilogy with the most definitive third-person shooter gameplay of this generation while attempting to tidy up any and all loose story ends and shoehorn a bro-motional lump in your throat in the process. At the former, Gears 3 ultimately succeeds, especially in its rich suite of multiplayer content. Even the singleplayer campaign somehow manages to feel fresh despite rather conservative changes and a palpable sense of deja-vu coloring the majority of the campaign.  As for the latter? Shakespeare this ain't, and Gears 3 struggles at times with its forced attempts at heart-string pluckery, but I can forgive it as much; gore-starved guns adorned with toothy chainsaws easily atone for any cheesiness suffered along the way. Destroyed beauty, hope runs deep, brothers; to the end.  Part poetry, mostly marketing slang, the Gears 3 story continues with what amounts to a blood-drenched tale of woe, suffering, loss and absolution, cathartica that stands out in harsh relief when framed by the '80s era Schwarzenegger-ness of most of the dialogue. Cue the attendant grimaces, bro-vado and non-stop X-TREME one-liners.  Translation: Gears 3 delivers exactly what you'd expect on the story side, ironically good news for longtime fans. For the rest of you, roll your eyes, chuckle and carry on. It's not Gears of War and Peace, people! Things on Sera have gone from really sucky to really-really-sucky in Gears 3. The Coalition of Ordered Government, aka COG, has all but disbanded and fallen even farther out of favor with Stranded and survivors alike, if that were even possible. The action follows Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad's last stand against the Locust and every garden variety of Lambent, creatures that have become infected by Sera's yellow glowing Imulsion fuel. Drama aplenty ensues, along with lots of surprises for all your favorite giant macho dudes. Dom sports a scruffy playoff beard and overalls, Cole faces a serious mid-life crisis, bad guys spurt out from the ground like Locust geysers (gone are the Emergence Holes, replaced by the aforementioned geyser action and troop-spewing stalks), there are more Carmines and wouldn't you know it, Marcus' dad is alive. WTF, Epic? Everything about Gears 3 exudes polish. On the surface, it easily outperforms its two predecessors. Crisp visuals, fractured lighting and billowy smoke effects bring the world to life, giving this final and ever-decaying vision of Sera a tangible sense of place. The sound design creates one of the more cohesive combinations of music and sound effects in any game, fashioning an immediately recognizable experience. At its heart, Gears tells a story of survival. Everything you do over the course of the five-act story revolves around endurance. You'll go from escaping ambushes to scrounging for supplies to scavenging fuel to using ammo-less Retro Lancers in nasty-ass bayonet fights. Everything feels solemnly desperate and dire, a motif the designers use to great effect throughout the campaign. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F119%2F1194638%2Fgears-of-war-3-20110915000954471-000.jpg&caption=Killing+from+behind%3F+Coward. Delta Squad has grown and changed, bringing the total number of playable characters to eight, adding the now-armored Anya Stroud, Samantha \"Sam\" Byrne and Jayson \"Jace\" Strattonplus to the ranks alongside Marcus, Dom, Cole, Baird and, of course, Carmine. Gears 3 feels exactly the way you'd expect it to feel, but better, as everything's been overhauled and fine-tuned. The roadie run feels faster, snapping into cover works better and combat has been tightened-up. Plus you can kick fools while you vault over cover, which seriously rules. There's a ton of new implements of doom with which to shoot, impale, gouge and chew up your enemies with, including weapons like the Digger, a gun that allows you to fire a grenade underground for sneaky AOE kills, and the Silverback, a sweet power loader outfitted with chainguns (YES!!!) taken right out of Aliens. Overall, a few keg-o-rator moments (who gathers around a watercooler to talk about Gears?) will stick with you from the campaign. Nothing quite as iconic as the first Berzerker encounter from Gears 1 or the Brumak rodeo from Gears 2, but rest assured, you'll want to start the slow clap around the midway mark of the game during a sequence that features arguably the best use of music in a game since the finale of Red Dead Redemption. All that said, the game definitely lives in the shadows of Gears 1 and 2, screaming retread at every giant shiny-handled  door that needs opening, every split-path decision and with every cut-and-pasted sound cue .  I suspect Epic planned as much. Yes, there are new weapons, new enemies, and new multiplayer modes, but it's clear that Epic didn't want to stray from the path too much. It seems like the developer instead opted to take the universe as it stands and work within the already established boundaries to bring the trilogy to a close instead of reinventing the cog. Yes, the game is better overall\u2014arguably the best of the series\u2014but it's still the same stuff we've done and seen before. This becomes especially apparent during the boss fights, and specifically the final boss encounter, which felt completely predictable. This left me wishing Epic would give something as rote as boss fights the same overhaul they've so successfully used to subvert other clich\u00e9d gaming tropes, but no dice. It's also worth noting that while the game looks super slick, the framerate will often collapse under the crush of a multitude of enemies on screen, or too many bullets fired too fast while using ironsights. And like other Gears game before it, Gears 3 doesn't really give a flock about collision in the environment, a phenomena that mostly occurs in single-player. Just try and run along almost any wall, and your weapon and hands will go right through them. Ostensibly, a small trade-off for the fidelity and level of detail we're treated to elsewhere.

I also found it curious that a game like Gears puts such an emphasis on collectibles. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy finding COG tags and unlocking the Achievements that accompany them as much as anyone, but with bullets flying fast, music pounding and enemies screaming, drooling and hissing, it feels odd to simultaneously search high and low a widget or a wingding. What about survival? Do we really care about a lost statue? Gears of War 3's five acts should take you around 15-20 hours to complete depending on how much you search and scrounge, and what difficulty you play it on. You can rush through it fairly quickly if that's your thing. I spent the better part of 14 hours on my first playthrough (solo, on Hardcore, trying to go for all the collectibles). The campaign can be played with up-to 4-players in co-op; I played both solo and in 4-player co-op and I definitely recommend playing with friends (it's way faster), though I will say the AI is generally better and more helpful in a fight than most bots you'll play with. And the multiplayer content alone could keep Gears fans busy until the holidays and beyond. Ah, multiplayer. Gears 3 multiplayer has a lot to prove given Gears 2's rocky, beta-less start that required multiple title updates just to get into serviceable shape. The Gears 2 multiplayer changed things up largely for the worse, with many frustrating results. Tough-to-navigate menus, poor matchmaking, slower movement, wonky cover system, multi-second stuns from grenades, a bevy of weird exploits\u2026 it all added up to a giant meh, certainly not what anyone expected from the follow-up to the much-loved multiplayer of the first game. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F119%2F1194638%2Fgears-of-war-3-20110915000957499-000.jpg&caption=Be+the+bad+guys+in+Beast+Mode. After running all of the modes and maps through their paces, we're happy to report that the multiplayer content has received ample attention, easily outdoing Gears 2 in both matchmaking performance and new features. Horde 2.0's currency system tasks teams of up-to five players with managing your cash to build reinforcements, blurring the lines even further between traditional Horde and true tower defense. Beast mode turns the tables, casting you as the Locust in wave-based challenges where you earn tokens to unlock more powerful creature types. Versus comes with 10 multiplayer maps, including an updated (and night time) version of the Gears 1 classic map, Gridlock, and features a full suite of multiplayer modes, including standbys like Warzone and Execution, the Meatflag-esque Capture the Leader, along with a well-paced Team Deathmatch. The latter doles out 20 lives/respawns to each team which, once depleted, switches over to a last man standing format that's tense down to the last kill. Most of the multiplayer sins of the past have seen serious TLC, with a new emphasis on movement. You won't want to cover camp for long as the arsenal your opponents have at their disposal will pick you apart if you don't stay agile and alert. It's more hop and pop than stop and pop, a fast-paced return to the action of Gears 1. You'll still need to watch for those obnoxious kids that shotgun roll; the Retro Lancer's charge attack (hold B for a timed kamikaze run) makes for a serious deterrent for those who abuse the shotty."

        "Content": "Perhaps more than any other shooter series this console generation, Insomniac's PS3-exclusive Resistance games have best captured the desperation of war. The series has never been about jingoistic glorification of patriotism. It's never really been interested in pumping you up for a battle. This war has always been about the fate of the entire world and the brave men and women that will stop at nothing to try and save it. Most shooters overlook the human element of the story but Resistance puts these characters front and center. There is something deeply moving about a game where that kind of responsibility is in the main character's hands. This is particularly true of the latest entry in the series, Resistance 3 .  War is horrifying in any context but it's particularly bleak here; it's safe to say that things are looking pretty dire for the human race when the third game kicks off. It's been four years since the events of Resistance 2 and the once thriving human war effort has dwindled down to almost nothing, with pockets of humanity still struggling to fend off the Chimera. This alien menace has begun terraforming the planet to be more like their icy homeworld and, with the appearance of an ominous worm-hole opening up in the skies over New York City, it's starting to look like Earth is well and truly lost.    Enter Joseph Capelli. He's a family man living in Haven, Oklahoma, who is propositioned by series stalwart Dr. Malikov to escort him to New York in a last-ditch effort to close the worm-hole before it's too late. Capelli doesn't want to leave his wife and infant son and at first refuses Dr. Malikov's request, but eventually changes his mind when he realizes this may be the only shot his son has at living a normal life. It's a surprisingly touching moment when Capelli is forced to say goodbye to his loved ones and, as he clings to his son's little mitten for the rest of the campaign, you really do feel his sadness.  Right off the bat, Resistance 3 controls wonderfully. There's a quick and powerful feel to the guns; each one is sharp and accurate and packs a hell of a wallop. The shooting mechanics are tight and responsive, ensuring you're equipped to deal with the many moments you'll be outnumbered by dozens-upon-dozens of feral Chimera, just itching to rip you apart. And yes, this happens a lot.    Move functionality has also been included for Resistance 3, though this control method isn't quite as finely tuned. Firing from the hip is effective but the noticeable lag between your motions and the actions on screen make aiming down the crosshairs incredibly sluggish, even with the sensitivity all the way up. It just doesn't cut it in the heat of an intense battle where you'll want every advantage you can get.  Luckily, you're never without an arsenal of awesome weapons and, in keeping with the high standard set by the previous games, Resistance 3's guns give you free rein to kill creatively. Old favorites like the Auger and Bullseye are back, only now each weapon automatically levels up the more you use it, unlocking upgrades like incendiary ammo on the fly. There are also a few new weapons, such as the 'Mutator', which causes enemies to rapidly grow boils that swell up and explode. You can even get your hands on the Chimera's own 'Deadeye' sniper rifle.  Every kill in Resistance 3 is exceedingly satisfying - not only because of the first class arsenal and tight controls, but also because each time you take a Chimera down, it lets out an explosive death growl that tells you it's expired.   The train authorities get quite tough on fare-evaders in the future.  In terms of tone, Insomniac has really amped up the gut-wrenching terror for Resistance 3. This is the darkest and most violent game in the series, and almost the entire second act of the game will have you on the edge of your seat. The Chimera are meaner than ever here. One particular scene shows a screaming man having his head ripped-off by one of the ruthless alien invaders, upping the ante when it comes to gore in the franchise. Creepy environments like mines, caves, sewers and even a prison are also not for the faint-hearted. It's a spine-chilling experience, and if you play this game alone at night, you'll likely go from explosive growls to explosive bowels.   Resistance 3 has plenty of large-scale battles and towering bosses but it's the game's ability to continually change things up that keeps the experience fresh. While boat levels, train levels and escort missions aren't uncommon in modern action games, Insomniac has placed them perfectly throughout the campaign in order to diversify the action.  At no point over the course of the 10-hour story does the narrative's surging momentum ever waver. One moment you might be in an all-out skirmish, the next you're creeping through a field of long grass, stealthily stabbing Chimera in the back. While the action might slow down from time to time, the intensity never does. Insomniac knows that without valleys you can't have peaks and its pacing in Resistance 3 is exceptional in this regard.   Where's Johnny Rico when you need him?  Insomniac's focus on character and story also helps set Resistance 3's campaign apart from its shooter contemporaries. The studio's team of writers have crafted a storyline that continually gut-punches you with its emotional resonance and unexpected moments, particularly in its second act. Without spoiling anything, the story takes a surprising detour through some dark territory before returning to the mission at hand. It's nice to see a shooter in this day and age that never loses sight of the importance of story.  Even with such a strong single player campaign, Resistance 3's multiplayer continues to be one of the series' strong points; it's very well-implemented. Some fans may be disappointed that the player count has been scaled down from 60 players in the last game to just 16 players in Resistance 3, but ultimately this down-sizing merely makes the multiplayer combat more personal and less chaotic. Plus, when you consider how different the world in the game is since the events of Resistance 2, it only makes sense that multiplayer matches would also reflect this change.    The other big change to the series' multiplayer is the introduction of Abilities. Having a perk system is quickly becoming de rigueur for online shooters but it's a necessary staple Insomniac has embraced well. Resistance 3's Abilities work in much the same way as the perk systems in most of the current crop of competitive shooters. You can spawn a holographic version of yourself, Total Recall-style, or get the radar to show you the locations of all the ammo in the area.  Kill-streaks also unlock some equally handy actions in the heat of battle, like the ability to deploy a shield that floats in front of you, or camouflage yourself like a Predator (someone at Insomniac has been watching a lot of Schwarzenegger movies). Leveling up your character will reward you with some really cool stuff, which is obviously a boon for loyal players.  Weapon upgrades also keep you coming back for more, and the more you level up, the more weapons you start to unlock. New players will start off with the M5A2 Folsom Carbine or Bullseye, though after a few rounds you'll quickly start to acquire more tactical options, like the Rossmore shotgun and Marksman (which lays down an automatic turret as its secondary-fire mode). Eventually, you'll have the entire arsenal to pick and choose from. The Auger, with its ability to see and shoot through walls, is particularly useful for killing enemies that like to camp inside buildings.  The usual Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag modes make an appearance, as well as a Deathmatch Small mode, for people after a more intimate kill-fest. War Games mode allows for objective-based matches, much like the ones that made Killzone's multiplayer so compelling. Breach mode has a group of attackers trying to destroy the defending team's reactors and Chain Reaction has players attempting to gain control over multiple areas throughout a map in order to open or stop a worm-hole. This mode in particular can lead to some especially epic battles.    Co-operative mode is back in Resistance 3 too, although much like the competitive multiplayer component, the number of players has also been scaled back. It's down from eight players in the last game to just two players in this one. This makes for a more intimate co-op experience that's better suited to the nature of the story being told here. Insomniac has also included an option to play the co-op mode in split-screen, which is a blast if you have a buddy to hang out on the couch and kill aliens with.  The combination of a stellar single player campaign and multiplayer modes that are full of superbly-executed additions adds up to an overall package that has earned its place in the upper echelons of not just first party exclusives, but console shooters in general. If this truly is Insomniac's last Resistance game for the foreseeable future, then the developer certainly went out with a bang... or perhaps more appropriately, an explosive growl.  "

        "Content": "Let's Golf 3D brings back all my fond memories of Mario Golf. Playing the N64 original or GameCube's Toadstool Tour , I could spend hours on end just lazily hitting the links and playing through hole after hole. If you've ever enjoyed that same series \u2013 or Hot Shots Golf, over on Sony's systems \u2013 you can let this newest (and first) \"3DSWare\" game carry you right back to the clubhouse.   Gameloft is a company infamous for its cloning of other studio's successful designs, but it's hard to get too upset at the practice when it works this well \u2013 Let's Golf 3D takes the same Mario Golf mechanic of timed button presses to determine your shots' power and accuracy and lets you loose to swing your way through six new, colorful courses. They're a varied bunch of environments ranging from deserts to the frozen tundra, so it feels like a new golf experience even if the style of play is old hat to you.    Of course, Let's Golf 3D isn't an entirely new golf experience \u2013 it's a ported version of Gameloft's Let's Golf 2 , originally seen last year on the iPhone and iPad. That's not a bad thing, since those first editions were incredible (earning a 9.0 rating in our review). And this 3DS version has that little something new \u2013 3D.  It looks great. The 3D is often subtle, since the game wasn't originally developed with it in mind \u2013 but even though it was an addition during the porting process, the effect is enriching and adds noticeable depth.  The rest of the package is deep as well, as the play mechanics ultimately build on their Mario Golf foundation and add ways to influence your ball in mid-flight, special super-powered shots unique to each character and unlockable gear like clothing that effects your golfer's stats.    There are inventive extra challenge modes to give even long-time golf gaming veterans a run for their money in single-player, and a two-player mode that lets you pass one system back and forth between you and a buddy.  There's even a Free Hole mode that lets you takes as many shots as you want on any hole, so you can just screw around and explore the environments.",

        "Content": "Zombie Gunship's concept is simple: build an entire game out of the extremely memorable AC-130 gunship sections in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. But instead of blowing up insurgents, make the killing a little more tasteful by making all the enemies undead. Brilliant, right? The game is super simple and rather bare-bones in its current 1.0 state, but it's already hard to put down, and developer Limbic Software has lots of ways to expand the formula.  The player is far-removed from the action in contrast to most other zombie titles. Playing as an aerial gunner, you're tasked with defending a bunker from a never-ending cascade of shamblers for as long as possible. The bunker is presumably a safe-haven for the living, but this isn't really elaborated on in any major way. Zombie Gunship is light on story to say the least \u2013 it doesn't really have one, but it doesn't really need one.  The action is simple \u2013 hold and drag on the touch screen to move the camera, and tap the 'fire' button in the corner to rain down some lead. Players have three guns at their disposal \u2013 the (relatively) quick and accurate 25mm, the mid-range 40mm and a massive single-shot 105mm Howitzer. Reloading is automatic, and players switch between guns with a quick tap of the 'switch' button in the top-right.  The action continues until the player slips up or becomes overwhelmed, when 3 civilians are killed by friendly fire or when a zombie reaches the bunker. Once the game is over, the coins players earned slaughtering Zombies (or saving the occasional civilian) can be spent in an upgrade shop. The usual slate of upgrades are available, from increasing a gun's rate of fire or reload speed, to improving the effectiveness of the in-game radar. Impatient players can buy upgrades with real cash rather than waiting for their in-game coins to accumulate.  What makes Zombie Gunship such a hit is Limbic's great eye for detail. After pressing the fire button, each shell takes a bit to reach its target, providing a great sensation of flying high above the action. The grainy black & white visuals and occasional radio chatter reinforce the illusion. The gameplay itself has a nice, zen-like simplicity to it. Large group of zombies? Unload on them with the 105mm. A single straggler about to end your session? Dispatch it with the fast and surgical 25mm.  My only real complaint is Zombie Gunship's light amount of content. The game would be much stronger with more than a single map or single mode of play. But Limbic nailed the feel of the core shooting, so hopefully some free content updates are in the works to expand on this great foundation. ",

        "Subtitle": "An incredible, uncensored return to form!",
        "Content": " Last week Warner Brothers and YouTube channel, Machinima, gave fans their third helping of Mortal Kombat: Legacy , a 12-part web series designed to relaunch the Kombat universe while promoting the recently released video game, simply title Mortal Kombat . Unfortunately, Episode 3 was an unmitigated disaster \u2013 a half-cocked, brazenly sloppy piece of work that lazily introduced Johnny Cage, one of the series least popular characters. To be frank, my confidence and excitement for the continued quality of this series was stirred. Was director Kevin Tancharoen steering this low-budget series in the wrong direction? Was the Jax/Sonya two-part story the only thing he got right? I feared the worst but secretly hoped for the best. After all, I'm a longtime Kombat fan -- I don't want this series to fail. Thankfully, it would seem the enormously mediocre Johnny Cage episode was just a fluke. Episode 4 is a grand return to form and easily the best episode of this series thus far.  Not only is this latest chapter rich with dazzling fantasy and fascinating character lore \u2013 including introductions for Shao Kahn , Baraka , Mileena , Kitana and Sindel , as well as the mysterious land of Outworld \u2013 it's a beautifully crafted, atmospheric experience to boot. The story is wonderfully painted with moody, and extraordinarily effective, motion comic-style animations and splashy, surreal live-action cinematography, all driven by a poetic narration (from Karin Inghammar). Sadly, the episode runs a little short again (just under 8 minutes, before credits), but there's plenty of twists, turns and intrigue crammed into that brief running time. And, of course, the promise of a second part to this story should keep people watching.  Obviously, some elements, specifically expansive backdrops, costumes and makeup effects (Baraka sort of looks like Yogurt from Spaceballs ) are brought down a little by the series' budgetary constraints. But Kevin Tancharoen does his best to hide his cheaper sets and mask the series' financial shortcomings with moody cinematic techniques and haunting visuals. And it works! Even some of the CG elements looks pretty awesome, for the budget. The cast doesn't get much dialogue this time out, so it's too early to tell if this two-parter will do downhill once the characters speak. But last week's weakest player, Johnson Phan \u2013 who plays the shape-shifting sorcerer Shang Tsung \u2013 gets one major moment of menacing maliciousness that redeems his decidedly flat performance from Episode 3. It'll likely send chills down your spine. In fact, the whole episode should bring out the goosebumps. While there's little fighting this time around, Episode 4 really sets the tone for things to come, and gives the series the proper introduction it deserves.  And, unlike last week, Episode 4 is presented uncensored, TVMA. It's filled with plenty of delicious gore to keep Kombat fans smiling ear-to-ear. No more waiting until the end of the week to see the uncut version. Thanks for listening Warner and Machinima. While I dreaded Episode 4, fearing it would be a repeat of the messy faults of the previous week, I'm eagerly look forward to Episode 5. Things are starting to fall back into place for this series. Hopefully Tancharoen and his cast and crew keep things together as this narrative develops. If so, I wouldn't rule out a theatrical, expanded \u2013 and presumably bigger budgeted \u2013 adaption in the near future. More Episode Reviews:   Chuck: \"Vs.

        "Content": "In today's diverse game development climate, it's hardly news that great things can come from humble beginnings. What is surprising is that one guy can create a game that, from an entertainment perspective, competes with some of the best mega-team offerings on the market today. UCLA undergraduate Josh Nuernberger near-singlehandedly created Gemini Rue , a 2D point-and-click adventure set in a sci-fi/noir universe, and those of you who live for a good story can't afford to miss it.  Nuernberger's been around the adventure game block before, creating previous title La Croix Pan with free development toolset Adventure Game Studio. With Gemini Rue, Nuernberger's refined his approach and presents us with a Memento-like story starring ex-assassin Azriel Odin. Convinced his former employers\u2014a shady group called the Boryokudan\u2014have done something with his brother, Odin sets out to find him on the rain-drenched planet of Barracus. The game plays like the best old school adventures, highlighting interactive objects with text and enabling you, with a menu of icons, to use or comment on them. You walk by clicking where you want to go and talk by clicking on people and choosing the \"talk\" icon. As the game progresses, you can also manipulate other characters by clicking the \"use\" icon on them and getting them to do things like open doors or hack computers. There's a smart use of traditional mechanics in Gemini Rue, offering common-sense situational puzzles and good art direction that eliminates most of that irritating pixel-hunting so common to the genre.   An ominous beginning.  While inspecting and manipulating objects is to be expected of a classically made a point-and-click adventure title, what isn't expected is the inclusion of action game-style gunplay. Being an ex-assassin in a Blade Runner kind of universe, it's no wonder our hero carries a gun. What's strange is how poorly he uses it. Through what amounts to an ambitious, if flawed mechanic, you control Odin using the ASD keys: S makes him take cover while A and D make him lean out to fire. Firing is done with the Space bar, and an onscreen meter theoretically enables you to execute head shots when it's in the green. The problem with this system is that firing feels a bit on the slow, unresponsive side and it's close to impossible to watch both a meter and a moving enemy. The result is that you're likely to die multiple times before getting through each fight and may even have to resort to setting the combat difficult on Easy in order to move on. This makes combat the one thing in the game that doesn't quite work, but thankfully it doesn't happen enough to become a real nuisance. Besides, there's so much in the game that works incredibly well.  Most successful is the way the multi-thread story is handled. Parallel to Azriel Odin's plotline is a second thread featuring infamous space prison Center 7 and a mysterious inmate called Delta-Six. Center 7's directive officially is to \"rehabilitate\" violent criminals by wiping their memories and retraining them to be good citizens. At first we, like Delta-Six, have no idea what's going on as a series of inmates sidle up to him, warning him against one another and giving him questionable hints about his past. A faceless Director speaks ominously soothing words about the bright future ahead of Delta-Six while inexplicably training him to use a gun and we're left wondering, \"What the hell is going on here?\" It's a seriously complicated web of misunderstandings and deceit and one you'll have a great time untangling.  Graphically, the game is done in the hyper-pixelated style of the much-loved adventure games of the 80s and early 90s and while gamers new to the art style may be put off by the simplicity of it, nostalgic adventure gamers are sure to appreciate and embrace it. Nuernberger gets an awful lot of ambience from very economical means and obviously understands the importance of sound in an interactive experience. Gemini Rue's voice acting is admittedly a bit uneven and some supporting characters come off as slightly wooden, but the main characters (especially anti-hero Azriel Odin) exhibit the personality and toughness that they should. Composer Nathan Allen Pinard deserves credit for some deftly-handled scoring. The Barracus city sequences are desolate and moody with a lone horn against a backdrop of rain, making an infiltration planning sequence, which could have been cheesed up with an \"Eye of the Tiger\"-style approach, into something quiet and melancholy.   Welcome to the machine. "

        "Content": "A couple months ago some weird stuff started happening in Azeroth. Sinister characters began to infiltrate the main cities, and as time progressed, giant, angry elementals began to wage war on the forces of the Horde and the Alliance. This was all the lead up to the release of the third expansion for Blizzard Entertainment's massively successful MMO: World of Warcraft: Cataclysm . Blizzard uses this opportunity to take a broader look at their six year old game and figure out what needed to be updated to keep World of Warcraft relevant. They used the emergence of a main lore character, the massive evil dragon Deathwing, from his place of slumber to terrorize the mortals as the catalyst for the changes. Apparently, Blizzard figured a lot needed updating, because almost all of the old game has been completely redone.  From the very start, the experience for players who pick up World of Warcraft now will be vastly different from the experience players had when the game launched in 2004. Quests, once splintered and sending players aimlessly across the map, are focused and quick to complete. Tales of having to kill fifty boars for three boar hides are done away with, and storylines -- actual storylines! -- populate the game world. It's a newer, friendlier Azeroth, and these changes span the entire original game. But seeing as how all of these changes are available without a purchase of Cataclysm, why pick up this latest expansion?  Cataclysm unlocks all the level 80-85 content, which specifically includes five new zones for leveling, two new battlegrounds, a PvP and daily questing area, seven new dungeons (and two redone classics) with normal and heroic (max level) modes, and a few raid instances. It's a lot of content, but it's not as much as the previous expansion, Wrath of the Lich King. That said, you can still expect to play for well over a hundred hours before you've really touched upon everything Cataclysm has to offer.    Buying Cataclysm also unlocks the Worgen race for the Alliance and Goblins for the Horde. The Goblins begin on the technocratic isle of Kezan, led by the seemingly malevolent Trade Prince. Their opening has an unusually small number of combat-focused quests, instead using the vehicle system introduced in the previous expansion, Wrath of the Lich King. I have mixed feelings about this choice, as although the quests are interesting and fun, they don't do a great job of teaching new players the ropes in the same way that the newly revamped starter areas for the original races do. On the other hand, the chances that someone brand new to World of Warcraft will immediately buy the core game and three full expansions is somewhat slim, so this little concern is just that -- a little concern.  The Goblin race showcases World of Warcraft's more lighthearted side. The opening quests are all centered around greed and mafia-style beatings, all done very tongue-in-cheek. Playing as a Goblin also provides sassier feedback. Hammering buttons for skills that are on cooldown causes your character to say \"nah, I can't use that yet!\" in a tone of voice that makes you feel sheepish for even trying. It's pretty great. Their racial bonuses are also some of the most useful and flexible in the game, with a ranged damaging attack and a gap-closing leap sharing a cooldown, worldwide vendor discounts, a boost in healing from potions and a slight increase in attack and casting speed. Then there's an alchemy boost and the ability to summon a banker anywhere to ice the delicious racial cake.   Impressive set pieces dot the new zones.  The Worgen seem frankly a little less powerful. They've got an increased critical chance and a sprint ability on a cooldown, as well as nature and shadow resistances. They get a bonus to skinning and skinning speed too, but overall their abilities seem less universally helpful. That said, the resistances are to arguably the two most frequently encountered schools of magic in the game, and the goblins have no resistances whatsoever. The Worgen origin story is much more dramatic than that of the Goblins. Starting you off as a human in the isolated city of Gilneas (which had been hinted at since WoW's launch, sitting just beyond the impenetrable Greymane Wall), you are given the routine task of getting orders from a superior, only to find him dead. Upon returning, everyone everywhere is under attack by wolfmen, and as the city begins to fall to the new threat, your do your best to fend off the attackers. Naturally, in Werewolf movie-style, you get bitten and eventually become one of the beastmen.  Where the Goblin story was a tale of new beginnings and the struggle against a villainous dictator, the Worgen story is of a crumbled society trying to rebuild and find allies in a world they had long been segregated from. It's gloomy but involving. Stories of this depth would have been a rarity in World of Warcraft prior to Cataclysm, but along with the update, the eight original races have seen brand new storylines as well.  By level 80, regardless of your race, you're fully assimilated into your faction and have even achieved some renown for your deeds in Northrend during the last expansion, Wrath of the Lich King. When you return to your capital city, you're given the choice of heading to Mount Hyjal, an important lore location throughout Warcraft and home of the World Tree (also important!) to aid the druids in the fight against rampaging fire elementals, or heading to the island of Vashj'ir, recently emerged off the coast of Stormwind and home to the Naga, a race of evil serpentine people. This was to ensure that the launch wouldn't have thousands crammed into one zone, but it also gives you something to check out later, or on another character.   Purty.  If you choose to journey through Hyjal, you'll interact with major lore characters from the very start, and come face to face with some familiar enemies from World of Warcraft's first raid instance, Molten Core. This will be a big nostalgia-blast to the face of WoW veterans, but is of little consequence to everyone else. Quests in Hyjal begin somewhat stereotypically -- your first has you collecting berries and killing rock elementals -- but peppered throughout the zone are vehicle quests, spaced out just enough to keep the standard quests from getting repetitive. The vehicle quests are a hoot, too. One is an airborne game of Joust, where you have to clumsily control a bird and knock others out of the air. Another has you climbing a tree and lobbing bears at a trampoline. The quests are spread across the zone around various shrines which you are tasked with cleansing or rescuing. You never dwell at a quest hub longer than a few sets of quests, which keeps you moving through the zone at a nice pace and in a logical order.  Vashj'ir is aesthetically the opposite of Hyjal. Completely submerged, Vashj'ir introduces true underwater questing to World of Warcraft, and sustains it for the duration of two and a half levels. It's a huge and beautiful zone, full of vibrant colors and teeming with sea life. There are fewer novelty quests, but a long chain where you embody a Naga, one of the amphibious serpent-people that are regular enemies in Azeroth, tells the back story of Vashj'ir and fills in the Naga's sinister intentions for their current campaign of terror. Questing underwater provides a surprisingly different dynamic to the game, as threats lurk not just around, but above and below you now as well. There are also a couple stand-out set pieces: giant shelled creatures that serve as quest locations and help keep the constant swimming from becoming tedious.  From there, you're onto either Deepholm or Uldum. Deepholm is an enormous circular cavern filled with crystals and living rock. It's the Elemental Plane of Earth for Azeroth, so you appropriately fight alongside and against a lot of earth elementals. The story here puts the entire plane in great danger of erupting into Azeroth, as the World Pillar, an ancient Titan construct that keeps the planes separated, was broken when Deathwing (the evil dragon!) emerged. The Horde and Alliance had seemingly put aside their differences in the face of this threat, but the machinations of the Twilight's Hammer, a fanatical cult, had severed those peaceful bonds. Naturally, as a veteran of many campaigns, it is up to you to help recover the fractured World Pillar pieces and prevent catastrophe. It's a bit of a complicated setup, but it's executed through a series of quests that help you piece together what's going on.    Deepholm's circular structure makes questing in the zone a pleasure. It's never difficult to figure out where you are headed, and it's never a long journey. The occasional cavernous trek provides the sensation that the Plane of Earth is multilayered and far larger than the small portion you're questing through. Even though the vehicle system is rarely used in Deepholm, questing rarely becomes repetitive thanks to incremental boss battles. The fights aren't your standard \"kill it before it kills you\" scenarios; they require you to move and read patterns and act accordingly, and each fight is a little more complex than the last. Deepholm also has something very rare in an MMO -- closure. You are tasked with piecing together the World Pillar, and once you've done it, it's done. There is still stuff to do within the zone, but that threat is no longer omnipresent.  Uldum on the other hand doesn't have the benefit of an ending. In fact, it's a tangled web of short little stories, often interspersed with clever cutscenes. When you first enter the zone, you are captured by natives. Although you can follow that story -- of escape, revenge and liberation -- to completion, it never feels \"done\". Luckily, so many of the quests in Uldum are inventive and original that it stands out as my favorite of all of Cataclysm. A sequence in the Harrison Jones (an Indiana Jones/Harrison Ford parody) quest chain simulates a turret level in a first-person-shooter with a surprising amount of responsiveness. A separate quest puts your character inside a giant ball of molten plasma and tells you to roll over a thousand gnomes (who stick to the ball Katamari style, and even reference Katamari in the rewards), and a couple others do a decent job of simulating a real-time strategy game. There are dozens of cutscenes scattered throughout Uldum to fill out the story, making the adventure-film feeling complete.   This quest was particularly satisfying.  Only the final leveling zone, the Twilight Highlands, failed to truly impress me. Although there were certainly some neat moments, for the most part it failed to showcase something new the way the other four zones had. The emphasis on story that permeated the others also seemed downplayed, with only a few select cutscenes of, well, very mixed quality. It also didn't provide any striking visual appeal the way the others did, instead looking like the crummy, run-down, ghetto parts of The Shire from The Lord of the Rings movies.  At 85, there's still a good deal of content left. Nine heroic dungeons provide a decent challenge, with a very good mix of boss fights and gimmicks. Most of the people I've played with have been telling me how much harder they are than Wrath's heroics, although I personally found them to be on-par, and I think the perceived difficulty is mostly because of the gear reset -- people aren't in super strong equipment anymore. Heroics no longer reward players with epic items, which I think is a change for the better. Epics should feel like a major achievement.   Voice acted cinematics fill in some story, interesting quests fill the rest.  Guild level ups do feel like a major achievement, thanks to the new guild progression system. Doing a dungeon run with at least three other members of your guild or completing a quest will net you some guild experience. Everyone in the guild earns it, and it all contributes to a communal experience bar. It takes a lot to fill it, though. It took my (excellent) guild Pockets Full of Magic a week to get from level one to two, with two of us going from 80-85 being by far the largest contributors. There are 25 levels in total, with the earlier levels providing perks that benefit everyone regardless of goal (such as boosted experience gains, increased reputation, and bonus cash) and the later perks being more targeted towards raiding guilds (a button to summon all party members, and a mass-resurrection spell etc\u2026). It's not something your guild can just grind out -- there's a daily cap that prevents you from gaining more than a certain amount of experience in a day -- so when your guild finally levels up, it feels like you and your guildmates have really achieved something.  A big chunk of player versus player content comes with Cataclysm too; two new battlegrounds, Tol Barad, and guild PvP support. Twin Peaks, one of the battlegrounds, is a capture-the-flag style map like Warsong Gulch, but wider and with a river in the middle that can be a deathtrap if you're not mindful. The other, Battle for Gilneas, is a capture-the-node map like Arathi Basin, but with three nodes instead of five. They're both built for ten players, and while Battle for Gilneas seems balanced and built for fast-paced movement, Twin Peaks is asymmetrical and could theoretically have balance issues. They add a little variety to the random battleground button which is nice, but a new game mode might have been better.   Goblins. You can't not love them.  Tol Barad is pretty great though. Three structures are placed around a central fortress controlled by whoever won the last siege. The previous victors have to hold the structures while the attackers have to take them. It doesn't sound great, but each structure makes a different kind of character valuable. One benefits ranged defenders, while another forces close-quarters fighting. Winning Tol Barad doesn't give you the same worldwide benefits that the last world-PvP zone Wintergrasp provided, though. It simply unlocks a raid dungeon and extra quests to do while the zone is under your control.  Finally there's Archaeology, the new secondary profession. It's really just an extra thing to do to kill time and won't really give you any real benefits. It does a good job of sending you to parts of the world you may not have ordinarily visited, and as you complete ancient relics (which you do by collecting relic shards scattered across the map), you get neat little insights into Azeroth's history.

        "Content": "Most iPhone games made for true gamers try and cram console controls onto a touch screen. But with Infinity Blade , the first iPhone game to use Unreal Engine 3, developer Chair Entertainment created a game that could only work with a touch screen. The result is a beautiful, addictive, and surprisingly deep game easily among the best available on iOS4 devices.  Infinity Blade begins with an assault on the castle of the God King. It's unclear why you have a beef with the God King, but he seems like a bad enough guy to merit a sword in the face. Unfortunately, you can't even get past his giant guardian, who quickly crushes you. The God King then drives the treasured Infinity Blade through your chest, absorbing your essence.  Twenty years later, you return as the son of the fallen hero, out for revenge. Battling your way through the castle, you fight against tougher enemies but have all the skills and items of your ancestor. Then the God King, who is far more powerful, beats you in combat and shoves his sword through your chest. And so your son eventually comes to the castle seeking revenge. So goes the endless loop of Infinity Blade, which manages to continue this cycle even after you've slain the God King.     I've never had an issue with the cartoony look of great games such as Angry Birds and Game Dev Story. These are the games that keep me hooked to my iPhone, but then again, I have never seen a game that looked as good as Infinity Blade. This is an absolute stunner for any handheld device and ushers in a new era of possibility for high-end graphics. I won't toss a bunch of graphical jargon your way -- let's just say that Infinity Blade uses a lot of the visual tricks often only seen in console games. It's a stunning achievement on both iPhone 4 and iPad (with the 3GS version also looking good, though not nearly as impressive).  Of course, a pretty package means nothing if the gameplay doesn't support it. Infinity Blade has that covered.  There are no virtual joysticks or buttons to press. You don't walk through the castle either. Instead, there are touch points for entrances to different rooms. You choose where to go, but the movements are scripted. Once in a room, you can maneuver the camera with your finger, searching for hidden loot and potions. There's always at least one enemy in a room waiting to test your mettle. Combat is where it's at.  Battles are designed to feel like you're in a sword fight. This isn't like most action games where you just run in, swing your sword wildly, and vanquish your foes with ease. Attacks are handled by swiping your finger across the screen in any direction and for any length. Infinity Blade detects it all and instantly translates it into combat moves. String a flurry of strikes together for effective combos. As you play through Infinity Blade multiple times (20-30 minutes per Bloodline), enemies get tougher. Soon enough, defense is the only way to survive.  Tap anywhere on the left or right third of the screen to dodge in that direction. Dodging is tough -- you have to really nail the timing. Blocking with your shield is handled by tapping anywhere on the center section of the screen. This is the easiest way to defend, but each block weakens your shield until it reaches its breaking point. Parrying might be the toughest of all, but the most satisfying. You must quickly judge the direction of your opponent's attack and strike in the opposite direction. Timing is critical. The deeper you get into Infinity Blade, the more you'll be forced to mix up your defensive moves \u2013 parrying, dodging, and blocking in varying orders to counter different attacks.  It's challenging, but a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. It can be frustrating at times, because Infinity Blade is almost too good at picking up even the tiniest swipes as attacks. Sometimes you'll want to dodge, but even the slightest drag of your finger registers as a blow instead. There's certainly a learning curve. But stick with it and Infinity Blade becomes one of the more rewarding experiences on iPhone.   Well-timed magic attacks can reverse fortunes.  To keep you playing, Infinity Blade has an RPG side to it. There are numerous pieces of armor, shields, helms, and weapons to tackle, each with its own unique properties. And every piece of equipment has a set amount of experience points already inside of it. As you use equipment in combat, you drain the XP from the item and into your character. It's an interesting way to handle gaining experience. Once an item is fully drained it's \"Mastered\" which doubles its resale value and gives you an extra stat point to spend on improving your character.  This unique leveling system encourages trying different items and can actually add to the difficulty. I was on Bloodline 7, fighting enemies a dozen levels greater than mine, and using the second weakest weapon in the game because I wanted to siphon off its experience points. This made combat tougher, but it was the best shot at quickly earning some bonus stat points to up my character's skills.  It only took a few hours before I'd exhausted every weapon and had trouble leveling-up my hero further, but Chair Entertainment plans to continue to support Infinity Blade after release with new items, new enemies, and new areas of the castle to explore.

        "Content": "I remember listening to an old orchestral medley of Super Mario Brothers way back in 1999 when I was in college. To this day, it's one of my favorite orchestral pieces, not just because it represents a loving slice of my youth, but because, as an avid film score and orchestral nut, it's actually a very moving piece. Who knew Mario hosted such thoughtful, engaging music.  Almost 10 years later, I discovered that this medley was taken from a group of long discontinued CDs called Orchestral Game Concert . Between 1991 and 1996 there were five CDs released, each hosting over a dozen video game tunes redesigned as orchestral numbers. The medley's ranged from obscure titles like Kabuki Story of Heaven's Magical Barrier to popular games like The Legend of Zelda , Super Metroid , and, of course, Super Mario Brothers .    Now, it seems, concert organizers and composers, Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall, are once again resurrecting these great tunes for a live concert series titled Video Games Live . The first concert ran in 2005, and since then, there have been several more. The series has become so popular, there was a CD release back in 2008 titled Video Games Live: Volume One .  Now, it seems, the wonderful concert series has come to DVD and Blu-ray as well. Picking up where Volume One left off, Video Games Live: Level 2 offers a fresh new assortment of video game music (including new orchestral themes for current titles like Halo and Starcraft II ), and some classics, arranged into a concert. Not only are the tunes an exciting sonic jolt to the senses, but the film is equally as visually immersive and exciting.    The disc includes orchestral versions of the following game themes: Classic Arcade Medley, Dragon's Lair, Tetris, Halo, Civilization IV, StarCraft II , Sonic the Hedgehog, Advent Rising, Guitar Hero (Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion), World of Warcraft, Chrono Cross, Mass Effect, Megaman, Myst, The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Brothers, God of War and Castlevania .  But that's not all. The disc also includes a wide variety of extras, ranging from additional interviews, to featurettes, trailers and more, but more on that in a moment. The concert is presented in 1080i (not 1080p as the box suggests), and while 1080i presentations aren't always the greatest, this presentation is far better than expected, even though some interlacing does still rear its ugly head from time to time. The image is sharp and crisp, with solid blacks and nice depth. Obviously, it has a shot-on-HD TV special look to it, but as far as concert releases go, this disc looks pretty great.    If the transfer doesn't bring the concert to life for you, the high-res DTS-HD mix most certainly will. Crowd cheers and applause envelop the listener, while the lively, aggressive orchestral beats fill in the remaining space, giving the sub and surround channels a nice workout. Often concert releases are poorly mixed, removing the live concert feel, but Shout! Factory does a wonderful job keeping the spirit of the live event intact.  And finally, the disc comes jam-packed with an impressive assortment of extras, more than most concert BD releases. Fans are treated to a wonderful commentary featuring creator/composer Tommy Tallarico, who discusses the origins of the concert, how the concert has grown over the years, his favorite games and much more. There are also eight additional interviews not seen in the concert itself, as well as four in-depth featurettes running roughly 30 minutes total. And finally, a slew of video game-centric extras, from promotional featurettes to trailers for games like God of War III and Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 1 . There's honestly something here for everyone. Shout! even tosses in a DVD copy of the film, too.     Video Games Live: Level 2 is an awesome release. Sure, it would have been nice to see a 1080p encode, but the transfer looks gorgeous anyway, the DTS-HD mix is absorbing, and the extras are just terrific, appealing to video game fans and orchestral geeks alike. What more could you ask for from a Blu-ray concert release? This disc is the next best thing to the actual live experience."

        "Subtitle": "A platformer that pays tribute to the classics while claiming its place alongside them.",
        "Content": "It's no coincidence that Super Meat Boy shares its initials with Super Mario Bros.  This is a pure platformer that boils gameplay down to nothing but running and jumping.  Meat Boy's goal is always the same: he must reach Bandage Girl, who is ever in another castle.  Doing so is never an easy task thanks to the numerous dastardly traps in the way.  One prick from a buzzsaw, spike, or monster's jaws will splatter Meat Boy's bloody pixels (which remain as a grisly reminder of your failure during your next attempt).  Even though you only have two maneuvers at your disposal, the developers never run out of clever ways of obstructing your path.  In a game like this where you need to be able to make precision jumps and turns, the controls have to feel just right.  The developers understand this and, just like Super Mario Bros., it feels good to control Super Meat Boy.  He has a nice weight to him and a beginner player will get the hang of it almost immediately even on advanced stages.    Super Meat Boy is an extremely difficult game.  Make the slightest mistake and you'll have to restart the stage over from the beginning \u2013 there are no checkpoints.  You might die a hundred times before you are finally reunited with Bandage Girl and the game gleefully keeps track of every death in the Statistics menu.  It's such a tense experience my hands hurt after a while and I couldn't get a good grip on the controller any longer because of the sweat.  But you have unlimited tries and most stages take less than a minute to complete once you know what you're doing.  When you are triumphant you are rewarded with a replay of all your attempts running at once -- dozens of Meat Boys flying across the stage and being eviscerated by traps.  Even though Super Meat Boy doesn't have a multiplayer mode, it's a great game to play with friends.  Since you often have to make many, many tries before completing a stage it's perfect for passing the controller around and letting everyone have a shot.  Your first time through the game you'll be so laser focused on just completing each stage it's likely you'll miss the many secrets.  There are warp zones that lead to secret areas where you might find new playable characters from recent indie games.  Commander Video from the Bit.Trip series on WiiWare is here as well as that kid from Braid.  These guests have their own behaviors that might help you in a tight spot.  Commander Video can float for a moment, for instance.  You can usually switch to a new character on the fly unless you're fighting a boss.  There are also precariously placed bandages to collect that can be spent to unlock even more characters.  Meat Boy isn't in this alone.   Watching dozens of Meat Boys during a replay is one of the year's most delightful moments in gaming. The developers' influences are obvious, as the hilarious cut scenes reference everything from Ninja Gaiden to Adventures of Lolo to Mega Man 2.  A Donkey Kong-themed level is named \"Weibe,\" after Donkey Kong champion Steve Wiebe.  The rocking chiptune soundtrack is the best I've heard since Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game.  Find a warp zone and the visuals will shift to a more pixilated, 8-bit style emulating the NES, Game Boy, or Atari 2600.  Super Meat Boy pays tribute to classic platformers while simultaneously claiming its place on the throne with the best of them.  Those cut scenes I mentioned are very funny, but they don't have the polish of the rest of the game.  It is these scenes where you can tell Super Meat Boy was made by just two dudes.  But I do appreciate the game's bizarre sense of humor.  I mean, it's got a hero made of raw meat who is in love with a band-aid that is kidnapped by a fetus that won't stop flipping people off.  If that's not a recipe for a good time I don't know what is.",

Like Angry Birds, you must apply basic physics to your game plan, such as cutting certain ropes in a specific order to swing the candy over the monster before snipping the final string.  There are three stars in each puzzle, too, that you need to collect by swinging the candy into them. You can complete a puzzle without capturing all three stars, but doing so not only increases your score, it also helps unlock future levels. The pacing of the stars is so smart. In the first dozen or so stages, collecting all three stars is easy. But then collecting only two is easy.

As you slice deeper into Cut the Rope, things definitely get more complicated, but never frustratingly complex. New hazards are introduced, such as spiders that crawl along the strings, elastic ropes that snap your candy across the screen, bubbles that float the candy up (and sometimes into trouble spots, like spikes), and air vents that push swinging candy when you tap them. Learning how to both avoid and (often) use these features is critical for getting the prize to that sweet tooth of a monster. The puzzles are so expertly created \u2013 seriously, I never found a bum puzzle in the bunch \u2013 that you can see the solution when you start, which gets you hooked on piecing together the steps necessary to get that three-star rating.  If there is anything in Cut the Rope that might frustrate, it's the puzzles that require speed and precision. Now, it's not that Cut the Rope isn't playing fair here. It is. You just need to be fast. And to be sure, I really liked the challenge of these puzzles, slicing ropes in a certain order as the candy swing around the screen. But if you are really struggling to slice through exact ropes, perhaps the HD version for the iPad will work a little better for you.",

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 might not be a massive step up from the previous incarnation, the game is a significant improvement and there's a ton to enjoy even if you've plowed through last year's 2010 edition.  Look, even though Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 doesn't absolutely require you to have a Wii MotionPlus peripheral, at this point in the game you owe it to yourself to get one: for this year's version, EA Sports' Tiger Woods team outdid last year's incredibly impressive golfing experience with a swing mechanic that mirrors golfing as accurately as you can get on a videogame controller. While armchair golfers might swear by the two/three click system or the analog flick control, virtual golf feels much more real when you're swinging a stick around. EA Sports has been working to get this mechanic right for four iterations now, but I think for 2011, its fifth game using the Wii remote, the team nailed it with something that's both fun to experience and accurate as hell.   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 Nintendo Wii Review - Video Review   Though the Nintendo version isn't a slouch in visuals, you're obviously going to get a better looking experience on the HD consoles \u2013 those systems have the strength to make all the PGA courses look far more beautiful than the Wii edition. But it's not the visuals that make Tiger Woods work here: you're not going to get a more immersive game of golf than on Wii. The Wii remote has been a tricky beast for some developers to handle, but the Tiger Woods Wii team clearly shows a true understanding and manage to make the Wii remote work as close to an actual set of golf clubs as you can get with this generation of controllers.  There are a variety of different control schemes: a pick-up-and-play \"All Play\" option for the beginner and the \"Normal\" and \"Advanced\" options that are pretty much what the team created for Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 on Wii. Then there are the new tweaks: Advanced Plus and Tour Pro, two Motion Plus-enhanced controls that take into account all the subtle twists and turns in the backswing and the drive that apply the draw or fade. If you can get a grasp of what the game's looking for and how it affects the ball's flight in these two modes, you'll find it an incredibly accurate simulation of golfing even without the feedback of the club head connecting with a ball.   Now you get even more control over the fade and draw.   To enhance the \"you are there\" feel, the team added a new first-person \"True View\" mode. Here, everything you're doing is through the eyes of your golfer, right down to the drive of the ball. When you're ready to swing, you glance down at the ball, either on the ground or the tee, and you can move the club with insane accuracy \u2013 this mode really shows off just how much the Wii MotionPlus helps with 1:1 motion.   It's a great viewing option that comes at a cost: if you play this way, you see the whole game from your eyes. Which means, once the ball sails off into the distance, the camera doesn't zoom in or cut away to a different view. While accurate and true to the sport, this definitely hurts a major Tiger Woods design: the control of the ball's spin while in-flight. I've never been a fan of the \"put forward/back/side spin after the shot\" design due to its lack of realism, but it's been a part of Tiger Woods for nearly a half decade so it's a staple. But without the ability to see where your ball is going \u2013 the ball will disappear behind hills and trees or simply get lost in a mess of low resolution pixels \u2013 it's difficult to know which direction you should apply the ball's spin, and how much.  You can choose to switch back to the standard camera system at any time through the option menu, but it would have been so helpful had the developers added a hybrid \"True View with Classic Camera\" option to cover all its bases. Maybe next year?   Disc Golf? Still amazing.   It's not just in the controls where the Wii version excels. Remember last year's unbelievably fun Disc Golf mode? It's back, and while it didn't get (nor did it need) any tweaks in its control, it is now a mode you can play online along with normal golf. Disc Golf is really just the developers showing off its ability to know and understand Wii MotionPlus \u2013 again, you can play this mode without the peripheral, but it's far more natural (and fun) with it. College students should flock to this game for those rainy days when they can't head to their officially sanctioned disc golf course. I'm still up in the air in deciding which of the two --  EA's disc golf or Wii Sports Resort's Frisbee Golf \u2013 plays better, but considering how many courses you can play, and the fact you can play online, well, you're clearly going to have a good time here.  The developers throw in the same batch of \"party game\" options that enhance the golfing experience that ensures this isn't just a dry golf simulation: lots of target shooting, lots of fast-paced modes. And this year, we get Mini Golf! Yep, 36 holes of traditional putt-putt, and, while this mode isn't much better than some of the ten dollar options you can get on WiiWare, it's not a throwaway feature and it's certainly fun if you can get a couple people to play with you. But sorry, no online Mini Golf \u2013 this mode's just for the local players.   Mini-golf is a fun diversion.   Of course, the focus here is true 18-hole golf, and this game does it all: Stroke, Skins, Best Ball\u2026all the main options are here for single and multiplayer, both offline and on. The big bulletpoint for the 2011 series is the addition of the Ryder Cup, a USA vs. Europe team-focused competition, and you can incorporate your Career Mode custom profile characters in this tournament as well as select from an army of dozens of professional golfers. There's an insane amount of depth in this golf game, but \u2013 other than the inclusion of Ryder Cup \u2013 last year was pretty insane in the depth department, too.  The online uses EA's servers so, thankfully no Friend Codes are needed. Once you're all signed up for access you can set up a lobby for either standard or disc golf with specific settings, or simply look for a random match-up. Strangely, the random matches are only set up between players who selected this option -- it won't pair you up with anyone who's created a specific game lobby. Oh, and beyond a basic keyword chat system, you really won't be able to talk with your opponent -- no WiiSpeak support in Tiger Woods."

        "Content": "Peanuts and Snoopy don't quite hold the same cultural cachet that they used to. While Charlie Brown and Snoopy will always hold a place in the hearts and minds of American culture at large, they're throwbacks to a different era. Other developers have tried and failed over the years to take the Snoopy/Red Baron gag from the comic strip and make it a premise for a decent game, so when Smart Bomb announced they were revisiting the formula, no one really paid attention. Unable to secure funding for an open world Snoopy adventure, they instead stripped their idea down and focused on the aerial combat aspect of the license.  So, here we are some time later, and Snoopy Flying Ace has arrived on XBLA. I'm not quite sure what Bizarro world I woke up in this morning, but somehow, Snoopy Flying Ace has taken a place as both the best dogfighting game of this console generation, and one of the most exciting multiplayer titles to come out this year.   More Snoopy: Flying Ace Info  The premise is simple but ridiculous. The Peanuts cast star as a menagerie of pilots in a fantasy-laden WWI setting, where Charlie Brown is a British Airman, Lucy is a German Officer, and Snoopy is an ace pilot looking to take on the evil Red Baron. The cast takes to the skies to engage in aerial combat that deviates immediately from any semblance of realism, as characters fire homing rockets, wield flaming flails, lay aerial mines, and more.  Of course, if you played Crimson Skies for the original Xbox, everything here should be familiar. Snoopy Flying Ace is achingly similar. Its graphics bear a fair bit of resemblance to the early Xbox Live favorite, though slightly cartoonier, and the weapons are recognizable as well. The controls are similar to Crimson Skies but mildly simplified. You can boost or brake and switch between a pair of secondary weapons, and you can perform acrobatic maneuvers by flicking the right analog stick in the appropriate direction.  Let's get this out of the way: while Snoopy Flying Ace has a single player component, it's not worth the price of admission for an 800 point XBLA title. It's not bad; the campaign has some fun moments, and weaving between a dozen enemy planes only to pull a vertical u-turn and launch rockets into them is profoundly satisfying. There's just not much campaign to be had. Single player will probably last maybe two and a half hours on the first playthrough. There's less story than an arcade title from the 80s, and there's no voice acting or even animation during \"cut-scenes\". This is the game's only real failing \u2013 gamers looking for a primarily solo experience should look elsewhere.     The campaign should instead be viewed as an introduction to Flying Ace's controls and mechanics, and in that regard it does what it needs to. It's an opportunity to experiment with the various weapons in the Flying Ace universe without the painful embarrassment of being blown out of the sky by someone's Avatar on Xbox Live.    Snoopy Flying Ace may look a bit childish, but the gameplay is surprisingly deep, and there's a steep learning curve for the first few matches online as you learn which planes you prefer to use and which secondary weapons fit your preferred tactics. For example, I had the best luck with slower, heavier planes equipped with the Rainmaker, a secondary heavy machine gun that takes a few seconds to wind up. Other pilots had success at my expense using the Leech, a homing rocket that attaches itself to a plane and then explodes (which can only be shaken off by performing an acrobatic maneuver).  As required in a post Call of Duty world, Snoopy Flying Ace features a points based ranking system. This doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things though, as the highest ranks only offer special access to an Aces leaderboard for the best players. While there aren't any perks or selectable killstreaks, there are rewards for uninterrupted killing sprees: after four kills, Woodstock the bird will perch on the back of your plane with a pair of pistols ready to cover your back, and after nine straight kills, you'll take control of the iconic red doghouse.     The main online modes, Dog Fight and Team Dog Fight, are beautifully chaotic affairs. You'll see several crisscrossing aerial duels zooming across the levels, and smart play is rewarded. Kills don't come easily in Snoopy Flying Ace, and they'll typically require as much outthinking as outshooting. Flying Ace also includes Avatar support, including purchased outfits, and there's something bizarrely satisfying about watching Pigpen shooting Boba Fett out of the air in a bi-plane.  Snoopy Flying Ace also offers several other modes, including Pigskin, a plane-based variation of football that requires real teamwork to play, capture the flag, and Dogpile, a mid-air version of catch the carrier. While these modes aren't likely to occupy as much time as the main Dogfight modes, they're good diversions when everyone needs something different from straight combat. "

        "Content": "For the past few weeks, it seems like all I've been talking about is ModNation Racers . Recording video reviews, working on previews, and just chatting with friends -- United Front Games ' baby has been on the tip of my tongue. Being engulfed in a game this way can often lead to a person getting sick of the title in question, but that hasn't happened here.  ModNation Racers is just too damn good.  Been ignoring IGN for, say, the last year? Well, first, welcome back, and second, you missed a whole bunch of ModNation awesomeness. At first glance, this game is just another kart racer with HD graphics. It comes with a career mode, a plethora of colorful characters to race against and earn for your stable, and an experience point-packing online universe. But as you settle in behind the controls, you'll find ModNation is so much more than just a kart racing game.   Our video review will set your tires on fire. For starters, this is the second title in Sony's \"Play, Create, Share\" catalog of games -- a lineup that started with LittleBigPlanet -- and it's worthy of that prestigious distinction. In ModNation Racers, you can create racers (known as Mods), karts and even tracks that you can then upload and share with the world, which means you can download other people's works of art, too. Before you say \"Oh, I never create anything in games,\" give these tools a look. You don't have to worry about adjusting body types, heights and what not when you're making a Mod; they're all the same body size, so it's just up to you to decorate them. It's like working with a really, really advanced Easter egg.  How advanced? Well, you can opt for a preset pattern that'll make up your character's skin, but you can also jump into the color wheel and spin through a vast array of shades, then tweak if your creation is made of rubber, cloth or metal, and then go nuts with 247 eye types, 315 mouths and so on. Toss in the fact that there are shirts, pants, hats, horns and more, and you're looking at a blank canvas you can do pretty much whatever you want with.  You can even take the basic shape stickers and layer them to create your own unique logos. I'm no artist, but I was able to whip up the Ghostbusters logo without any trouble in just a few minutes. All of this creative wonder and ease carries over to the karts. You can choose from a number of body styles, and then pop on wheels, hood ornaments, and your custom stickers.  When it's time to create a track, you choose from one of the preset themes -- alpine, desert, seaside or jungle -- and get to work. You'll simply drive to lay your road and have the freedom to twist and turn however you like. The right analog stick controls elevation, so you're free to climb to the sky or dip low into the ground and crisscross your already laid asphalt. If you're up for it, you can place buildings and sheep or you can select \"auto-populate\" and watch the computer bring your roadway to life in an instant.  I really can't stress how brilliant all of this creation stuff is. I loved LittleBigPlanet, but after creating my one level, I knew the process was too deep and convoluted for me. To date, I've made about a dozen Mods, tracks, and karts, and none have taken me more than 15 minutes. You can create really cool, detailed stuff in no time that looks like it belongs on the ModNation disc. My Zombie Daemon Hatfield looked good with his gray skin and red eyes, but then I began resizing dirt splotches and blood smears on his suit, and the creation came to life. When I looked online, I found people had already begun posting spot-on recreations of Spider-Man, B.A. Baracus from the A-Team and Bob the Builder.  If you can dream it, you really can make it in ModNation Racers.   Make your ugly, ugly dreams come to life. But, let's say you have no interest in creating anything -- you're a busy dude or dudette and just want to take from the endless stream of content others are making while playing a good kart racer. ModNation Racers has you covered. For my money, this is one of the best handling kart racers on the market and it's definitely got the genre cornered in terms of online options.  The first time I drifted in ModNation Racers, it felt natural; it's firm and precise. This is good because drifting is critical to this game. As you do so, you're earning points and filling a little meter on the right side of the screen. This meter, which can also be filled by spinning an airborne racer with the right analog stick, can then be used to boost or put up a temporary defensive shield.  The shield is a life saver -- it's one of the ways ModNation differentiates itself from the competition -- because the weapons here will kick your ass. As you're racing, you're running into item pods that give you a weapon or an ability. If you hold on to your payload and keep hitting the pods, you'll upgrade whatever you're carrying to one of three levels. Missiles that fire straight ahead become swarms of homing missiles, jumpstarts become portals that teleport you down the track, and so on. There are just four weapons/abilities, but multiple weapon levels make them feel varied.    When you feel the need to race -- and ever since getting this game, I have felt that need -- there are a few ways to scratch that itch. If you're jonesing for a solo experience, you can jump into Career Central. Here, you're playing as a character named Tag, but whatever Mod or Kart you want to use will be used and incorporated into the game's cutscenes, which is dynamite. This comical tale of revenge and redemption plays out over the game's 28 built-in tracks and offers you a ton of reasons to come back and replay the races.  Each course comes with one mandatory goal to advance to the next track (usually finish third or first) and then two additional objectives. Completing these unlocks content for you to use in your creations -- items, settings, stickers, and more. Sometimes, these optional challenges entail attacking an \"elite racer,\" one of the characters United Front Games created. Do so, and you'll be challenged to a grudge match after the race. Here, you race the bad guy and some goons. Win, and you get the character. Lose, you suck.  I'm basically saying there's a lot to do.   Watch us try to survive in MNR. Making the single-player, offline pot even sweeter is that every career level has five tokens hidden in it. Once you find these, you can cash them in at the shop and get a random accessory to use in your creating space.  All this playing with yourself is fine and dandy, but there are a bunch of things you can do with others -- and ModNation Racers really wants you to play with others. You can host local split-screen matches on your TV for up to four players, you can take one friend online with you via split-screen, and from there you can just join the online fold. You can host or join Causal Races where you can invite friends or jump into XP races that reward you with experience points so that you can level up your online persona (a number will appear next to your name on race screens). Both races allow for 12 players, but you can max out the ranks with bots in casual mode.  What rocks about ModNation multiplayer is how easy it really is. You can hop around the gameplay modes via a shortcut meter, but there's also a hub world called the ModSpot. You can see the most popular Mods and karts on pedestals, enter lap competitions, and just drive up to other players to start challenges or scope their creations. Clicking a button lets you see where your friends are, join them, and so on.  So, when's the other shoe drop, right? I've spent this entire review telling you that ModNation Racers is awesome, but it didn't get a 10, so what gives? For starters, there are a couple of small things that are basic oversights. When you're challenging a lap time online, you can't restart when you know it's over -- you have to finish the lap. While the game runs great most of the time, local four-player split screen does drop the framerate a bit. Although it's awesome your character pops up in cutscenes, these Mods can look a bit blocky here.  Still, the biggest issue is one I've been worried about since the beta: load times. Back then, the game was plagued with excruciating loads, and although those have been improved, they're not perfect. Basically, any time you jump between a major section of the ModSpot or enter into a new race, you have to sit through a load that can be anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds. Don't freak out -- most of the loads are not 45 seconds, but the more complicated tracks do take some time. Every time you start the game, there are two loads you'll have to sit through.   You'll always know what you need to do to unlock goodies. Undoubtedly, this is disappointing, but I don't find it to be a deal breaker. It tarnishes the experience a bit, but it's important to point out that (as hokey as it sounds) good things take time. Yes, you're waiting for 40 seconds or whatever to jump into a level, but once you're there, the game runs without dropping a frame, chugging, or loading a thing. The same can be said for the creation suite -- once you're in, you can switch between Mods, karts, and tracks, slap down homemade logos, and not have a noticeable load to speak of. I mean, you can lay track, drop a ton of sheep on it, auto-populate your course and never have to sit through a massive load.  For what this game is doing, this issue is tolerable."

        "Content": "Videogames have become a worldwide affair -- particularly in the HD era where budgets make multi-region and multiplatform development almost a must. It's not just about recouping costs, though; vastly improved localization efforts have led to audiences outside a game's native country being hungry for the unique quirks of a game birthed and nurtured in a far away land can have. Nowhere has this been more prevalent than in the increasingly niche realm of Japanese efforts.   This is you. You are Shin. Shin has a furious feline fang. It's a bit of a surprise, then, that it took a whopping 14 years for the Sakura Taisen series to finally make it to the States. In stark contrast to, say, Nippon Ichi's Disgaea or Atlus' MegaTen games, however, it's a little easier to see why the series was initially judged to be the stuff of importers and otaku wannabes: Sakura Taisen is, first and foremost, a dating sim. A dating sim with giant mystical energy-powered robots that duke it out in a strategy RPG setting, sure, but it's understandable that some publishers would be leery of bringing the game over in years past.  There's another reason for the initial hesitancy: this is a SEGA game, made by an internal SEGA team, and that originally only appeared on SEGA hardware. The series eventually moved to the PlayStation 2 when SEGA's hardware business crumbled, but the post-Dreamcast publishing environment was even less of a risk-friendly option in the early days, and thus, the series continued to be successful in Japan but only accessible to an American audience with a decent grasp of the Japanese language and the fiscal means to import things.  Enter NIS America, who have not only taken on the unenviable task of localizing and translating the reams of digital text that make up the myriad conversations of Sakura Taisen, but who have also opted to do something SEGA never did: NIS is porting the game to the Wii with the help of developer Idea Factory. One need only look at the fact that the PlayStation 2's Special Edition is made up of two discs (one with an English dub and the other with the original Japanese dialogue) to see just how much info is in this game.  This is not a series known for its brevity.  That's precisely why it's such an interesting and, frankly, amazing experience, though. It's doubtful even the mighty PS2, with what some would rightly claim is the best RPG lineup in the history of games, has seen many titles with this much replay value. Multiple endings are in there, sure, but there are so many labyrinthine conversation threads and character dynamics that even though your first run through things will likely be over a couple dozen hours, the game is so rife with replay opportunities, it's entirely possible you'll head right into a new game after it's over.   This is Gemini. She's from Texas. She would like to look at them all. Much of that attraction comes down to two things. First, the game's turn-based-but-free-moving strategy RPG battles are fantastic, regularly incorporating environmental wrinkles to keep things interesting. Months ago, I plumbed the first several hours of the game to bring you guys some seriously meaty impressions and the general gameplay setup . Given that the preview was a whopping four pages, I'll leave that link above for you to actually get into the bulk of how the game works. What I will happily try to convey, though, is just how much of developer Overworks' later SRPG efforts shines through here. This is the same developer responsible for Skies of Arcadia and the absolutely brilliant Valkyria Chronicles -- and the latter's roots are especially apparent almost from the second you start your first battle.   Like Valkyria Chronicles, though, the initial rules are meant as a stepping stone to doing more than just fighting a bunch of evil robots. Things aren't quite as varied as the PS3 SRPG, but you can see how the developer dabbled in introducing elements like changing areas in multi-zone battles and using the environment to push objects and negotiate particularly hazardous areas long before they moved to the big black brick. There's a playful sort of experimentation with those base rules, and it makes for battles that never seem to be old despite the monster-of-the-month setup.   Oh, hi, Cheiron. Your name is prounounced like The fact that you'll never really \"level-up\" via traditional means also puts careful strategy and pre-planning (and, yes, a little trial and error, though you can always continue at the last major checkpoint of the multistage boss fights if you fail) at the forefront. You're challenged in more ways than just sheer enemy numbers or epic boss battles -- though those are certainly present in spades. Changing formations in battle can boost some attributes but lock out the ability to, say, heal when you're going on the offensive or dole out special attacks if you're being reserved. Factor in the ability to protect or call in support from other characters (which can strengthen ties during battle or lead to one-off conversation threads), and you have a multitude of options for progressing through a battle.  Instead of leveling up by killing enemies (there's actually no battle XP to speak of, and wasting time on common enemies can actually be a bad thing in some missions), you'll do it by building relationships with the rest of the all-female mech driving crew you've come to work with at the Littlelip Theatre in steampunk-fused 1928 New York City. Japan transplant Shinjiro Taiga could certainly be in less enviable climes than being the sole source of  testosterone in an all-girl revue, but he's initially regarded with reservation if not outright hostility from everyone in the group -- not exactly the warmest of welcomes.  But then it wouldn't be a challenge to actually build relationships if he just showed up and it was pillow fights and sleepovers every night. The fact that every chapter brings with it the opportunity to constantly build trust (and, yes, eventually some romance if you opt to go down that path) means that all the cutesy play dates and idle conversation is actually a means to strengthen the whole party; the more the girls trust you, the better they'll fight in battle -- literally.  This isn't a superficial improvement, either. Hit points, spirit points used for everything from healing to special attacks to tag-team blows, segments on that Mobility Gauge used for both movement and attacks, attack power, defense, agility \u2013 everything depends on getting to know each of the characters better. It also means helping them to grow closer to each other, resulting in team attacks that don't actually require the party leader to have some serious oomph. Because of this fundamental link between the conversation/dating sim bits and the strategy-based battles, Sakura Wars is almost constantly teaching you something, which is the key to keeping it all interesting.   Yes, I am -- of judging you too early. The characters, certainly, are the biggest help. You'd think that a pistol-packing little girl, an androgynously aloof and downright hostile Japanese import, a wheelchair-bound Shakespeare-quoting blonde, Japanophile Texas transplant and a tough chick lawyer from Harlem would make for an annoying group to deal with, but... well, they aren't. At all. Cutesy pretenses fade to genuinely interesting tales of woe, stern facades melt slowly revealing someone deeply connected to their community, wide-eyed optimism becomes an earnest sort of longing to belong. At nearly every point where you think the game is going to retreat completely into its admittedly heavy Japanese influence, it pulls back and veers off in an unexpectedly interesting and oft-times disarmingly touching direction.   Perhaps this is why the series has done so well in Japan and is held up with such reverence by those that were adept at understanding first kana and then kanji as the series went on. It wasn't the barrier to entry; it was that the characters are genuinely interesting. Wreathed in typical anime tropes initially, sure, but that fades slowly and admirably as the layers of each character are peeled back. I hate to say it, but I actually got invested in making sure all these characters were taken care of.   Throwdown on Wall Street Granted, decades of being the go-to reviews guy for all manner of quirky and oft-times downright embarrassing games from Japan (admittedly a generous portion coming from NIS America itself) has given me a cast-iron gullet for the kind of saccharine sweetness and government-quality cheese that emanates from a lot of these games, but I never rolled my eyes or sighed with that \"oh, Japan \" sort of feeling so many of these games with anime-rich presentations encourage. These are real, interesting characters, and they lose much of their outward appearance the more you get to know them, which is a real testament to the quality of characterization and indeed NISA's localization that they popped like more than cardboard cutouts. Suffice it to say that if you could put up with the last two Persona games' more annoying characters, it's relatively smooth sailing here.  The dynamics of dealing with the dozens of conversation topics and reaction opportunities is the key to making everything work. Though you're regularly paired up with someone while exploring New York, plenty of conversations are with multiple attendees, and often responses are binary -- pleasing some while leaving others nonplussed or even offended at times. Starting out, it can seem daunting to try to juggle so many personalities at once, but the beauty of the LIPS System is that as you learn more about the characters, their attitudes can change. Spend enough time getting to know someone and you'll not only start to gravitate toward more correct responses, but you may actually change how they respond to things that would have grated on their nerves in the past -- or at the very least the illusion that it's happening is sound. I won't know for sure until I try a different tactic on my second run-through.  I have to give plenty of credit to the English dubbing in this case. Though you can opt for the Japanese voice track in the PS2's Special Edition, Wii owners are by no means \"stuck\" with a lackluster cast -- though the anime tone will be that much stronger if you do, of course. In fact, I recognized a couple of familiar voices, including what I'm almost certain is Melissa Fahn, who did a fantastic job in selling Ed's quirky personality in Cowboy Bebop. That the voices in the game not only help make the characters more engaging at times but don't hamper things makes a big difference, though, again, I'll fully admit that I'm more than used to hearing these kinds of performances after so many years.   Giant hammer or no giant hammer, this guy's gonna get smacked. Composer Kohei Tanaka has also done a wonderful job in helping to infuse the game with a loungy sort of \"Roaring '20s\" vibe. References to Louie Armstrong appear both tonally and as an actual character, and each of the main cast has their own themes that are interwoven throughout the main game. The whole jazz-by-way-of-Japan feel fits the game perfectly, and though the rest of the sound effects on the mostly-static conversation screens are relegated to chimes and footfalls and the odd explosion or \"you lose\" bass dive, it all comes together to give everything a peppy, cheery sort of mood.   Despite being a 5-year-old game at this point, Sakura Wars isn't what I'd call an ugly game by any means. No, this isn't God of War II, but it's clean and well directed in its own right during the boxy, claustrophobic action sequences (the special attacks are particularly over-the-top in a good way). There's a fair amount of recycled CG when the STARS Division is deployed, but they're kept to snippets and often skip ahead or jump back when deploying multiple times per chapter. Plus, there's actual rumble during them -- something that seems to be weirdly missing these days -- and who doesn't love watching a theatre and an entire block of New York City transform into a giant slingshot? Hitler , that's who. Actually, no, he probably would have dug it, too. The cel-animated cutscenes are also very, very clean and though they're not all that flashy, they fit the reserved, laid-back feeling of the rest of the game.   We are indeed ready. When things go a bit more static, the character portraits are not only beautifully hi-res, but they animate well. Blinking and expression changes, for instance, aren't just a frame swap; they actually transition nicely. I know it sounds like a small thing, but you're going to be staring at a lot of faces in this game, and it's nice to see they always stay pleasant. I have to give a nod to the menu system, too, with slick collapsing screens and tilt-perspective typographic accents. It's a shame that playing the game on the PS3 causes the resolution-switch when going to the mid- and end-chapter save points to cause my TV to completely blank out for about seven or eight seconds, but unless you have the text on auto-advance, you're only going to miss the odd initial slow-pan camera before a conversation starts -- if your TV even freaks out. Playing on a native SD console, obviously, isn't going to be nearly as troublesome.  There are some things that never really cleared up as I was playing through Sakura Wars. The battles were a blast and varied enough that they never felt tired (though the final fight is an absolute marathon, so I hope you've taken the lessons of the previous chapters to heart), but some of the wording in the conversations doesn't really match up with the actual response. When so much depends on chatting up people with a silver tongue, it can be frustrating to pick an option and then have something rather different actually get said. Yes, it's the same in general \"theme,\" but there's still the odd jarring moment in there. Luckily, there are so many opportunities to talk to people in every chapter that it's never an issue of screwing something up so bad things can't be repaired later. "

        "Content": "It's obvious by now that the WarioWare series is Nintendo's license to let its game designers run wild with a very loose leash. I mean, come on, games where you poke someone's eyes out, or pluck boogers out of a nose? The untethered creativity has been something the WarioWare franchise has always embraced, from the GBA original to the DS and Wii follow-ups, and WarioWare D.I.Y . is pretty much the company handing over that creative license to the gamer. This is an incredibly engaging experience that puts huge emphasis on user-generated content: you have access to a rich set of tools to create microgames on the same level as you've seen in previous WarioWare games. There's a little bit of everything in D.I.Y.: programming, drawing, and music composing, all done in a way that's amazingly accessible to anyone's skill levels.  WarioWare D.I.Y. is essentially this generation's version of Mario Paint. Many Nintendo fans hold the Super NES title in such high regard, so it's baffling Nintendo's gone so long without reviving that mouse-driven art title on the mouse friendly Nintendo DS or Wii. WarioWare D.I.Y. encapsulates all the creative tools of Mario Paint and reproduces them in a versatile game creator. You can animate game sprites and paint full backgrounds as well as create a short musical tune or stitch together a longer song.  But most importantly, you're using those assets in game creation: you're building the same style of challenges that have been seen in previous WarioWare titles.  WarioWare microgames are just that: quick, brief challenges that last only about five to ten seconds. Half the challenge is in figuring out what needs to be done by the single clue that pops up from the start. It could be something simple like \"Start the car!\" and you'd tap the key in the ignition, or you might have to \"Get the coins!\" and you'd need to figure out that tapping a Super Mario block multiple times will get you the result you need.  Now, keep in mind that games you'll build and the games you'll play in WarioWare D.I.Y. aren't quite as versatile as they have been in past WarioWare games: to keep things a bit more streamlined WarioWare D.I.Y. only allows \"tap\" based games. So you won't be able to create challenges where you drag objects from one side of the screen to the other, nor will you be able to build games that use the D-pad or buttons of the Nintendo DS.   The ladybug is the first game you'll create in the extensive tutorial.   But it's working within these restrictions that's half the fun of WarioWare D.I.Y.'s game builder, and even though it sounds restrictive, there's actually a stunning amount of depth to the scripting available to the user. And every microchallenge that's in the cartridge and created by Nintendo's development team has been built using D.I.Y.'s engine. Some are simple, and some are so complex you'll probably see something and go, \"How the heck did they make that ?!\"  That's the beauty of D.I.Y.: you can actually look under the hood and see how the designers built each and every game.  WarioWare D.I.Y. forces players through a very thorough tutorial \u2013 you actually can't touch the game creator until you've gone through the first lesson. It may be a drag to sit through this if you just want to jump in and play around with the tool set, but trust me: the tutorial is handled extremely well and makes understanding the idea of objects, backgrounds, scripting, and data importing that much easier. You'll be up and running making your own games in about an hour.  This tutorial breaks down how the games are built, how object switches are triggered, and how to set up a \"win condition\" so that your creations can be actual games and not just interactive animations. If you need more understanding of how games are built, there's also a hidden \"puzzle mode\" that lifts from the book of one Professor Layton. You'll be faced with a game scripting situation, and you'll need to fill in the blanks with the specific programming script call to finish the job. It's actually a game within a game, but it definitely helps in learning the more advanced techniques.   Just to give you an idea of what WarioWare's capable of, here's a sampling of games I created during my review process:   Stuffed animals are scattered inside a crane game. Tap the kangaroo to grab it in order to move on, but you'll fail if you tap the other stuffed animals.   A one-to-one pixel conversion of the Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders: time a screen tap to shoot a bullet and take out the final invader before time runs out.   A driving game where you'll steer a car through a set of flags at the top of the screen. Each tap of the screen turns the vehicle 90 degrees as it drives forward.   If you're just interested in scripting and programming, you can simply import art from any microgame that's in your cartridge and use it for your design. If you just want to draw you can edit any microgame and replace the assets with your own creation. Or if you're a musician, you can tinker around with the composition tool and come up with your own score.  The games you create aren't just locked down into the Nintendo DS, either. You can send your creations to other DS systems using either direct wireless connectivity or over the Internet using friend codes and the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The fact that you can send designs between systems means you can collaborate: if you're better at scripting than you are at drawing, have a buddy on another system doodle up the objects and backgrounds. Additionally, if you're a Wii owner, you can buy WarioWare D.I.Y. Showcase off the Wii Shop Channel, which lets you send your creations directly from the DS to the Wii for play on the big screen using the Wii pointer instead of the stylus.  In fact, WarioWare D.I.Y. Showcase for WiiWare features several dozen more games that are unique to the download version. So any challenge you unlock on the Wii can be sent straight to the Nintendo DS version of WarioWare D.I.Y. and dissected for use in the game creation.   Draw your objects and build your games with touch screen scripting.   To be fair, because WarioWare D.I.Y.'s final games are generally weaker in capabilities than previous WarioWare microchallenges, you shouldn't really put the Nintendo Points down for WarioWare D.I.Y Showcase if all you're looking to do is play through the single player challenge. But it's great to be able to show off what you've created by sending video of your creation to YouTube, and it's a lot easier to do that on the Wii than it is on the DS.  Even with the scripting and control restrictions there's an incredible amount that you can pull off in WarioWare D.I.Y., shown by the available games and the designs you'll be able to download straight to the cartridge. The D.I.Y. cartridge holds an enormous amount of game data: you'll only have two slots to actively work in, but you can publish and save several dozen \"finished\" projects. You can save unfinished works as finished ones if you want to free up an active D.I.Y. to work in, too.  It's just a shame (and a missed opportunity) that you can't record your own voice for sound effects using the microphone, and I find it puzzling that there's no support for the DSi camera \u2013 many WarioWare microgames from past designs used still photos for their designs. I guess you'll just have to work that much harder to create photorealistic objects and backgrounds!"

        "Content": "Change can be a painful process. Just ask one of the unfortunate citizens of Kijuju, the fictional region of Africa that serves as the setting of Resident Evil 5, the latest entry in Capcom's ongoing zombie videogame saga. A power-mad corporation's evolutionary manipulations have caused a biological disaster that turns people into mindless hosts for a military-grade parasitic infection. And you thought the Bird Flu was nasty. The citizens of Kijuju are going through some ugly changes, many of which involve tentacles, oozing eyeballs and heretofore unexplored bloodlust. And, as is the custom in a Resident Evil game, you drop into the situation woefully underprepared for what awaits. The resulting experience is an intense, action-packed adventure replete with satisfying combat, tight gameplay and gorgeous, well-crafted environments. Resident Evil 5 offers all those things and then some, but it doesn't do many of the things longtime fans of the series expect. It won't scare you. It won't fill you with creeping desperation. It won't have you collecting and counting bullets like they're precious stones. It won't, in essence, make you feel like you're playing a traditional Resident Evil game. Like the story it's trying to tell, Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution. Capcom has gone out on a limb with the latest numbered sequel in its long-running survival horror franchise, and although one of your goals as a player is to survive the horrors around you, this entry in the series is a radical departure from the genre Capcom helped create near Raccoon City more than a decade ago. Gold Edition If you've never played Resident Evil 5 and want to own a new copy with all available content, get the Gold version. This uber-release contains everything the original did, plus these extras: - Lost in Nightmares Episode | Read the review - Desperate Escape Episode | Read the review - Versus Mode | Read the preview - Mercenaries Reunion Mode - Four new costumes - Extra (virtual) figurines All of the above can also be downloaded from Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network, either separately or (in some cases) bundles. So if you're just interested in the core game and, say, one of the add-on packs, you might be better off buying the original version of Resident Evil 5 and downloading the pack you prefer. It would be cheaper, and you'd have precise control over what you're buying. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition offer the same content, but they handle them a bit differently. The Xbox 360 version comes with the original Resident Evil 5 game disc and a card with a code to download the full Bonus Content pack, which comes in at roughly 1GB of data. The PS3 version stores the bonus data on-disc, and it requires a roughly 12-minute installation to the hard drive. Because all the info is stored on the PS3 disc, it's not instantly playable. You'll need to unlock the bonus Gold content by playing through the game. On the 360 version, however, everything is open once you download it. Both the Desperate Escape and Lost in Nightmares add-on packs are worth playing, but neither are essential to the Resident Evil 5 experience. Mercenaries mode is a ton of fun, but it's automatically unlocked at the end of the standard version of RE5, and the Mercenaries Reunion is simply the standard Mercenaries mode with some extra characters and costumes.  Versus Mode is a four-player, team-based deathmatch that's just sort of silly. Running around shooting other Jills and Chrises is nowhere near as entertaining as fighting waves of infected creatures. Some will enjoy the novelty of Versus, but the real multiplayer fun in RE5 lies in Mercenaries mode. Resident Evil 5 was one of my favorite games of 2009, and it's just as much fun a year later. The extra content included in Gold is just icing on the cake. If you've waited until now to buy RE5, you might as well go all-out, right? imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F107%2F1078200%2F480_re5_vdr_1268867144.jpg&caption=Watch+the+Resident+Evil+5%3A+Gold+Edition+video+review. You'll start out the game as Chris Redfield, who fans will remember as one of the co-stars of the original Resident Evil. But Chris is no lone wolf. Joining him on his mission is Sheva Alomar, an African national and bioweapons expert. Both Chris and Sheva are members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, a global outfit tasked with preventing the proliferation of \"biological organic weapons.\" And to date, the group has done a pretty poor job of it. From the incident at the Arklay Mansion (RE1) to the outbreak in Raccoon City (RE2) and the Las Plagas infestation in Spain (RE4), the B.S.A.A. and its predecessors such as the S.T.A.R.S. team have been one step behind the Umbrella Corporation and its mysterious backers. When we last left the story of Chris Redfield in Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, he and fellow former S.T.A.R.S. member Jill Valentine were battling through Umbrella's Russian base. So why isn't Jill at Chris's side in RE5? It's a good question, and one you'll have to play the game to answer. The extra content included in the Gold Edition sheds even more light on this mystery. This time around, it's Sheva who has Chris's back, and she'll be with you every step of the way, whether you go it alone or recruit a friend to play along. On your first playthrough you're stuck with the beefy Chris, whose bulging biceps and gigantic torso make Street Fighter IV's Ken look like a stick figure. Once you complete the game, you unlock the ability to play single-player as the more compact Sheva, who can handle herself and just about everything else. There are several scenes in RE5 where the more acrobatic Sheva will need to part ways with Chris to reach hard-to-access areas. It's a cool nod to the co-op nature of the game, but I felt Capcom could have gone farther with the concept. There are no moments when you truly feel separated from your partner, which could have upped the fear factor significantly. Part of the horror of past RE games lay in the cramped isolation of knowing you were all alone in a dark corridor. But here, you're never truly on your own, as Sheva is always at your side. When Sheva is controlled by the game, she does a pretty fair job of staying out of your line of fire, watching your back for enemies and healing or reviving you when you take damage. But just like any partner, she does have her annoyances. In RE5, as in other games in the series, each character is limited to a set number of inventory slots, and making the best use of that space is one of the keys to doing well in the game. In single-player mode, you have access to both characters' inventories, and you can swap items back and forth between them as you see fit. But Sheva likely doesn't have quite the same fanatical approach to ammo and health conservation that you do. She's a bit trigger happy, even when her targets aren't perfectly presented, and she tends to heal herself and Chris at the slightest sign of a flesh wound. But beyond that, I found her to be at the same time both refreshingly unobtrusive and surprisingly intelligent, as A.I. partners go. Some players will hand her a few weapons and let her loose on Kijuju, while others will likely restrict her inventory and use her as more of a pack mule. If you're a hardcore fan of the previous Resident Evil games, you probably just shuddered at the thought of you're A.I. partner wantonly wasting ammo, which was notoriously scarce in earlier installments in the survival horror franchise. But to understand how the gameplay in RE5 is set up, you'll need to forget just about everything you know about the series. Sure, there are parasite infected zombie-like enemies who want to kill you in Resident Evil 5, a situation that will be instantly familiar to fans. And there are some other through-lines as well. You can't run and shoot at the same time. Your inventory is limited. You can heal yourself by collecting and applying colored herbs. Weapons are upgradable. But there are also some looming differences. For the first time in one of Resident Evil's main numbered releases, cooperative play has been made the cornerstone of the experience. Nearly every aspect of RE5 is more fun with a friend, either online or via split-screen, which is available in both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Just fire up a second controller, hit the Start button and join in. The game doesn't do a very good job of telling you how do accomplish this, but it's there nonetheless. Split-screen play is handled a bit differently in RE5 than you might be used to. Rather than cut the screen evenly vertically or horizontally, Capcom has given each player an equal size horizontal offset rectangle, one on the upper left and one on the lower right of the screen. It's an odd effect at first, but the more I used it the more I liked it. Although there's less screen real estate in use, it's easier to stay focused on your own character because the two screens don't directly abut one another."

        "Content": "With most of its rivals hell-bent on compromise, DICE has always stood apart for trying to push the boundaries of what a military shooter should be. On a mission to free players from shackles of tightly scripted cinematics, choke points and one-man war-hero shenanigans, it's not hard to surmise that the Swedish studio kicks against almost everything that the 'corridor' shooter stands for.  Having spent years mining a rich seam of co-operative multiplayer freedom, the thrilling destruction introduced in Battlefield: Bad Company a couple of years back helped set it apart even further. In a genre where blowing shit up for fun is the entire point, being able to reduce buildings to rubble was a real game-changer.  The sequel takes everything a step further, with a breathtaking evolution of its stunning Frostbite technology, tighter gameplay mechanics, and a more compelling narrative hook that dials down the hapless antics of the original. In short, it's better in every conceivable sense, and in many respects the definitive rival to the Modern Warfare series.   Bad Company 2 looks beautiful when it's moving.  In true Battlefield style, a large part of its appeal is the extraordinary freedom afforded to you. Far from funnelling you through a predictable sequence of events, its wide, expansive environments often present enormous scope to experiment in ways which contrast wildly with its competitors.  And yet despite this more freeform approach, the Swedish studio still manages to craft a focused, fat-free thrill ride of an experience with the kind of pleasing variety, expert pacing and cinematic intensity that has long been the hallmark of more restrictive, linear-minded shooters.  Adopting a darker, more intense atmosphere than the knockabout larks of the original Bad Company, the moody opening flashback prologue sets the tone, revealing backstory intrigue of a powerful secret Japanese weapon which dates back to the Second World War. Returning to the 'near future', a new era of Cold War tension is about erupt into full-scale war, and the infamous 'Bad Company' quartet are once again called into action to help stop this devastating device falling into the hands of the Russians.  Private Preston Marlow once again provides the game's unlikely hero, as you trek across a typically diverse array of stunningly rendered environments via an equally varied selection of transport options, from tanks to choppers, quads and jeeps. With adventures spanning Chile, Bolivia, Columbia and Alaska, DICE takes full advantage of the Frostbite engine's unwavering prowess in rendering beautiful desert, jungle and snow-bound vistas that are among the finest witnessed on consoles to date.  But it's arguably the game's destructive environments which provide the most significant point of difference against its traditional rivals. The ability to blast buildings to rubble cuts both ways, forcing both you and your enemies into the kind of adaptive decision making that too few shooters ever bother to test players with.  Cowering nervously behind feeble walls, you're all too aware that tanks and RPGs will send you fleeing in panic, enshrouded in a confusing plume of smoke and dust. Such crucial facets of gameplay routinely force you into the kind of bold quick thinking that forces you to take the initiative. No longer do you sit patiently behind indestructible walls and doors, waiting to cap enemies whenever they obligingly peek out; gone is the transparent scripting and inert AI behaviour. If their cover is blown apart, they'll also seek a better spot, and the same applies to your squad mates.   Squad Rush is a real blast, much like the multiplayer as a whole.  Often faced with refreshingly wide, open environments, the options are endless. You can let your squad pick up some of the slack and hang back, storm forward and take the initiative, or sneak down the flanks and flush out even the most stubborn enemies. Armed with the knowledge that you can experiment, the gameplay is instantly liberated from some of the traditional constraints which can make the average FPS so predictable.  DICE is also mindful of the importance of good pacing, never lingering for too long over particular tasks or environments. In one of the more memorable sections in the Andes Mountains, you even find yourself forced to brave the freezing conditions, dashing between huts to stave off impending hypothermia. Among the regular battles, such moments of novelty prove to be a welcome distraction.   It's also worth praising the all-round polished 'feel' of the game, with superbly satisfying controls allowing for slick combat and refined vehicle controls. At no stage does it feel like there's any learning curve required whatsoever and anyone even vaguely familiar with shooters should adapt right away, regardless of which of the dozens of weapons you're wielding. It's a minor quirk that a game entirely built around dashing between cover points neglects to offer any kind of cover system (or even go prone). It's by no means a deal breaker, but it does feel a little old school.  That's not to say Bad Company 2 doesn't introduce a few shackles of its own. Irksome - and often downright illogical - boundaries prevent you from taking tactically astute-looking routes, while other times you'll find your progress thwarted by a suspiciously accurate one-hit-kill should you dare to make a brave dash to get in behind your foe. The game's certainly not immune to slipping back into standard scripted linearity either, but at least only tends to do for brief bursts of cinematic intensity. By and large, the illusion of freedom is maintained more convincingly than most.  It's also perhaps a shame that the seven hour-long single-player campaign doesn't borrow a few more elements from the brand's excellent multiplayer facet. The inability to influence any of your squad mates in any way blunts the vast tactical potential, while the use of vehicles in-game generally extends to little more than a spot of regulation on-rails shooting, or as a means of traversing from A to B. While there's no doubt that the game's narrower focus in single-player mode is highly enjoyable, the potential to truly up the ante in the military combat arena remains tantalisingly untapped in many areas.   Vehicle sections in the game serve as a distraction more than anything else.  Unafraid of its standing in the multiplayer arena, DICE and EA boasts that that Bad Company 2 'defines online warfare' - a claim that holds up to close scrutiny despite the presence of a mere four game modes. Set across eight sprawling maps (or 10 if you activate the VIP code in the box), each and every one offers a thrillingly varied context for the action regardless of the task at hand.  Based loosely on the environments you'll be familiar with in the campaign mode, the first thing to note is how they feel nothing like the kind of symmetrical arenas we've long since been acquainted with. With convincing realism, the incredible intricacy will provide a great leveller as players gradually figure out cunning snipe and ambush spots, and where the plethora of vehicles provides the best tactical advantage. The reality is that there are so many that even seasoned veterans will find themselves facing a true test, and it's a thrilling voyage of discovery from the word go.  In terms of the modes, it's perhaps an underwhelming list at first glance, but there's no denying the quality. First up is the classic Conquest mode, alongside Rush, Squad Rush and Squad Deathmatch. Seasoned Battlefield veterans will recall Rush was known as 'Gold Rush' last time around, with up to 12 players a-side battling it out to attack or defend team's crates, while the four-a-side Squad Rush compresses the action to smaller maps. Conquest, meanwhile opts for classic old-style team-based base-capture mayhem, while Squad Deathmatch has the added allure of pitting four teams of four against one another. Strangely, there's no free-for-all deathmatch, but maybe they'll add this during the inevitable round of DLC at a later date, hint hint.   Providing you're packing the right weapons almost everything is destructible.  Four classes make the cut, allowing players to choose from Assault, Engineer, Recon and Medic, with a customisable weapon selection that adds huge flexibility once you rank up and unlock new weapons. The experience system is pleasingly transparent, and rewards the usual task completion points alongside assists and combat awards for skilful play. No matter which class you play as, there are dozens of badges and awards to aim for, with no end of incentives for playing through as each class. The levelling system is also fair to the newbies, too, with well-balanced accessibility at the heart of the game. For the sake of the long-term health of the online game, this inability for the elite to become untouchable is crucial."

        "Content": "Right now you're reading a review for a game that shouldn't have ever existed outside of Japan. Mainstream gamers -- and most hardcore gamers, at that -- don't know the Tatsunoko brand. With very little promise of a commercial success, Capcom would be crazy to bring the latest in the Capcom Vs. series to U.S. shores, right? Not necessarily, no. You're reading about a \"dark horse\" game, no doubt.  But you're also reading a review for one of the best games on the Wii. If you're anything like me, you didn't know the Tatsunoko brand before you started seeing shots of some super hero dudes locking it up with the likes of Ryu and Chun Li in the Street Fighter arena.  If you take one thing away from this review though, it's that it simply doesn't matter. Any way you slice it -- be it the modes, balance, character diversity, depth, or ease of entry into the game itself -- Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is one of the best fighters we've seen since Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and it's a testament to good, old-fashioned 2D ass-kickery. A quick note on Tatsunoko, as most people will want to at least understand what they're looking at before making a purchase.  As always, Capcom's \"Vs.\" series is out to pair with a strong accompanying license.  Tatsunoko Publishing is extremely well-known in Japan as the brand that brought some of the best anime and characters to the region.  Franchises like Yatterman, Gatchaman, and Tekkaman Blade may not be known here, but these are the granddaddys of modern anime. Franchises like Gatchaman paved the way for heroic squad-based shows, as stars like Ken the Eagle and Joe the Condor can be likened to guys like Jason and Tommy from the stateside-popular Power Rangers series. While players might not know the Tatsunoko brand outright, they can have faith in the brand to deliver unique characters, each with their own style, swagger, and strengths.  It's a shame there's no real history section within Tatsunoko vs. Capcom's shop/collection system, but even without much backstory, the game is strong enough on its own to inspire fans to read up on the characters after going a few dozen rounds. Capcom's goal with Street Figher IV was to rebirth the fighting world, bringing in new players by going back to what's truly fun about 2D fighters.  After taking both games through the paces though, I've had a much more rewarding and downright entertaining time with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom than I ever did with Street Fighter IV. Street Fighter IV is without a doubt a top-tier fighter, and the true rebirth of 2D arcade fighting. But I'd argue that Wii fans are getting the true \"return to excellence\" with Tatsunoko, as the game offers more instant appeal and pure entertainment value than its more serious Street Fighter counterpart. Wii fans may bicker and complain that they don't have Street Fighter IV in Nintendo's library, but fighting fans that cut their teeth and dropped a fortune on Marvel vs. Capcom 2 back in the arcades might -- just might -- consider Wii's exclusive fighter to be the true ace up the sleeve.  The similarities between Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Capcom's latest fighter are pretty impossible to ignore, and that's a very good thing. Bottom line: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is just downright fun, and an amazing catch for the U.S. market. Obviously people are going to come from different camps as to what they want from a fighter, but as a guy that takes comfort in the high-speed, juggle-centric gameplay of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3, I found myself instantly enjoying what Tatsunoko has to offer.  At its core, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is a three button fighter, mixing all basic moves up by allowing each attack button (light, medium, and heavy) to pull off different techniques with the same motion.  Sometimes the change is minimal, like having different speeds for Ryu's fireball based on what button you use. Zero makes his TVC debut.  One of the many reasons to play this game. Okay... that's been around since, well, forever.  Look at other characters, however, and you'll find a lot of hidden depth. Casshan's \"Friender Call\" sends out his robotic wolf to attack his opponent, but each button used to execute the technique will pull off a different move.  Friender will come in and attack with a quick physical pounce, jump to mid-field and spit a flamethrower attack, or even latch onto Casshan's opponent and hold them in place for an easy combo.  That's one move, executed with three different buttons. The basic tag format of previous versus games still applies, so players will bring in two fighters from either the Capcom side, Tatsunoko side, or a mix.  Tags can happen at any time and there's a short recharge period after assist attacks or switches so that players can't just spam the tag button over and over. All the combined super combos you'd expect are alive and well. You can cash in your super meter for single-fighter attacks or you can stack them so that you and your tag partner jump in at the tail end of each other's supers and leapfrog from gigantic attack to gigantic attack (assuming you've got the super meter filled enough to do it). When tagged out, fighters also slowly heal themselves, refilling the red part of their damage meter over time. The combat is simple enough to get you playing and having fun from the first match, but after a short time the more hardcore players out there will discover the barouque combos, crossover combos, air crosses, mega crushes, and other higher level techniques. What's nice: those aren't required to enjoy the game, and overall Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is extremely intuitive and \"newbie friendly,\" without sacrificing depth. What this ultimately comes down to is that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom can achieve all the openness and intuitive gameplay found in a basic fighter, but then stack an immense amount of hidden depth in there as well.  If you only want the basics, hammering on a \"light, medium, heavy\" combo will instantly chain attacks together in a cinematic display.  Attacking down at an angle while on the ground with a heavy attack will pop any character up into the air, even making things more simple for those that use the Wii-mote and nunchuk combination. Classic controller and GameCube support is easily the best way to play the game -- unless you're one of those people that don't mind dropping the cash for the amazingly sick MadCatz stick. It really is exceptional -- but if you have a younger gamer in the family or simply want to make combat extremely casual, the default Wii Remote/nunchuk setup is perfect.  The three buttons become one universal attack button with A, pop-ups automatically follow up into the air for players, and supers are in turn much easier to pull off.  If you're in my camp -- those that swear by the likes of MVC2, Alpha 3, and yes, the all-awesome Capcom vs. SNK on Neo Pocket -- you'll want to grab a more traditional controller and really sink into the intricacies of the game. All the basic modes you'd expect are included in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.  You've got arcade mode (of course), time attack, survival, and vs. play, but there's also online, a training dojo that's absolutely essential, and a secret little bonus game that'll have some players sinking serious time into unexpected areas of the package.  Most of the modes work as you'd expect, and there are a few characters on both the Capcom and Tatsunoko side that are unlocked by continuously beating arcade mode with their own specific brand side, but it goes extremely fast. This game has style to spare. Frank West, for example, is unlocked by winning arcade mode four times, having a Capcom fighter land the last blow before the end credits roll. Win another four times and you'll unlock Zero.  There are a few that are more intricate, but when you can rip through a basic round of arcade in a matter of six or seven minutes it really won't take long to get the characters you want, and there are plenty to find. Another amazing way to get new players engrossed in the game is TVC's move list, which is extremely intuitive and absolutely essential in creating a user-friendly environment.  Not only can you go in and enable the list while in training, but players that hate spending time beating on a AI-less dummy can actually head on into any mode (arcade preferably, since you're unlocking fighters as you play) and enable the command list mid-battle.  Rather than pausing, looking at a few moves, and then unpausing, players can keep the command list as a half-screen window at the top of the battlefield, scrolling through the moves with the Z1 and Z2 buttons on the classic controller and actually play through the selected mode with the commands on-screen. Rather than being intimidated and picking only the few fighters you know, you can actually grab a few unknown guys on the roster, scale down the difficulty (if you so choose), bring up the command list during battles, and learn the game while still unlocking and enjoying the different modes. You're reading the final review, so the game obviously made it outside of Japan, but what most people might not realize until diving into the game is just how much Capcom added for their dedicated worldwide fanbase.  Not only do you have new characters -- Frank West, Zero, Yatterman 2, and so on -- but also a well-executed online mode and the aforementioned bonus game.  I had a chance to jump into the online arena for a few hours, and while I had some varying results, it held its own much stronger than something like Smash Bros. and is really going to come down to your own personal connection. My internet speeds are far from ideal, and I still managed to have a few matches with almost no lag. If you've already set up your net for other consoles, do a lot of online gaming, and experience great results from those games, TVC will be a very rewarding online experience.  Not only is there random battle across region and worldwide matchmaking, but the ability to add friends via code (or add a rival you played previously with no code necessary)  is also included.  There's both rank-free and full-on ranked matches, having a similar \"win point\" system to Mario Kart that awards you points for climbing the ladder against tougher opponents.  The friend roster is easy to manage, a simplified tag system is included so you can change your name and icon, and an elemental-themed rating system gives you quick insight to how your opponent is going to play, showing an ice icon if they play defensive, fire icon if they are big into offense, or lighting if they base battle on faster combos and lighter attacks.  Pretty cool. Oh Yatterman-2. Won't you be my bride? The bonus game -- Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Shooters -- is also a neat addition, minus a few small annoyances. It's four player co-op, and plays identical to old school Capcom games like Commando, making use of one shoot button that can be tapped for all-direction firing, or held for strafing around the top-view battlefield.  It would have been a bit more intuitive and \"current-gen\" had Capcom made it a twin stick shooter, but that would have required use of classic controllers or GCN controllers, so Capcom opted to go with a retro style instead.  The game is themed within the Lost Planet world, having huge bosses, branching paths, and a full-on ranking system when you beat the game, and it could have easily been its own 800 point WiiWare game. The only major gripe outside of wishing it had a more updated control set is the audio design, which has three of the four players (Ken the Eagle, Ryu, and Tekkaman Blade) shouting every time they fire.  Thankfully PTX-40A (the playable mech from Lost Planet) has no such voiceiver, and that instantly makes him the player of choice.  Any minor gripes aside though, Capcom delivered a full-on bonus game within Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, and it's robust. Branching paths, four player support -- it's a great unlockable. In the end though, it isn't the bonus modes or added content that makes Tatsunoko vs. Capcom a truly amazing offering on Wii. It's the execution of the core game.  The visuals are very impressive, mixing in an immense amount of fluid animation, while staying easy enough to see and react to in the heat of battle.  Both English and Japanese audio tracks are included, and the overall sound design is simply awesome.  The announcer is over-the-top, the supers have serious audio/visual girth behind them, and the entire game is a not only technically sound, but a full-on spectacle."

        "Content": "The designers of N.O.V.A ., Gameloft's new first-person shooter for iPhone, have been playing a lot of Halo. And it's obvious that when they took a break, it was only to play Dead Space. But while its derivative nature is on full display in every pixel of N.O.V.A ., so is something else: a slam-bang action game that draws a new line in the sand and challenges all else to top it. When you get your thumbs on N.O.V.A.'s exemplary controls, great scenarios, and excellent polish you will immediately understand why it scored our award for the best iPhone action game of 2009.  You are Kal Wardin, a former soldier drafted back into service to protect Earth from the fury of the alien xenos. A vanished space station has reappeared outside of Earth's orbit and it threatens the orbital platforms humanity has been forced to live on following the collapse of our planet's environment. You must explore this station to find out what happened, which in turn leads you on a chase across the galaxy that invariably ends up with you kicking in xeno teeth on their own turf.  Wardin has plenty of firepower to choose from, all standard-issue shooter fare like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Ammo is everywhere, but sometimes you must hack open a crate via a short puzzle to score the good stuff. In addition to normal weapons, Wardin also has special skills like the ability to freeze an enemy for just a few moments via an energy attack. The trade off, though, is shield strength. This tactic adds an enormous amount of strategy to N.O.V.A. as you really do need those shields so you aren't repeatedly staring at the sky through a blood-spattered visor. However, when you are facing down four or five xenos (all with clever AI that encourages group rushes, seeking cover, etc.), putting one on ice for just a few seconds is enormously helpful crowd control.  N.O.V.A.'s controls are very similar to Gameloft's summer shooter, Modern Combat: Sandstorm. Move via a responsive virtual stick, look by dragging a finger around the screen, and fire with a dedicated button. Things have been tightened up, such as movement sensitivity. The aim-assist feature is also quite useful when you first start playing N.O.V.A., as it snaps the crosshairs to the enemy you are looking at but without over-compensating. It's just a little nudge. It does not play the game for you but when you are trying to cross an open field with a dozen xenos on a rampage, getting a little \"snap\" is sometimes the difference between life and restarting from the last checkpoint.   Right between the eyes.  N.O.V.A. is a run-and-gun first-person shooter at heart, but it uses big scripted moments and set pieces to create some high drama across 13 stages, such as dodging small meteors as you race across a space station exterior. However, my absolute favorite event in N.O.V.A. is small. It's when a brutish xeno gets close enough to grab you. You are hoisted into the air and have limited mobility. Able only to reach your pistol, you must shoot the monster in the face repeatedly for it to drop you. Of course, if you haven't reloaded your pistol recently, you may find yourself in real trouble. It's a great intimate moment in contrast to the large-scale mayhem you are otherwise engaged in.   If there is any shortcoming in the single-player game, it is the aforementioned lack of originality. N.O.V.A. is essentially Gameloft's Halo with touches of a handful of other shooters thrown in just for good measure, such as the ship exterior sequences of Dead Space. With such a great control system and smart pacing, it is too bad Gameloft did not carve out something with a little more originality. That said, ask yourself if you currently know of an iPhone shooter other than N.O.V.A. that fills that gaping Halo-shaped void on the App Store?   Gameloft also infuses N.O.V.A. with four-player multiplayer. You can either challenge local players or wade online via the Internet (no over-the-air play). I have yet to suffer a dropped game, although I have seen a bit of chug and pop here and there. There are five maps, each taken from an environment in the single-player game. I enjoyed multiplayer quite a bit but do wish Gameloft had added some sort of character progression or customization. All you can do is switch out armor color. Where is my medal for 20 headshots? A cool helmet that players logging a certain number of matches get to wear?  N.O.V.A. is Gameloft's most attractive game yet without question. Running on a third-gen iPod Touch or iPhone 3G S, the game not only runs exceedingly smooth with no framerate hiccups, but does so with multiple enemies on-screen and lots of effects. On a regular iPhone, I only noticed the occasional pullback with an effect or slowdown --nothing that would upset the applecart.   N.O.V.A. was reviewed with version 1.1.0.  "

        "Content": "The Guitar Hero/Rock Band/Tap Tap style of rhythm games is getting old. Sorry, but it's a fact. The genre needs fresh blood to remain vibrant and viable. Glu's new Beat It ! is just the jolt music games on the iPhone needed. It's a smart blend of music-making and puzzle gaming that is both accessible and challenging. The music is uniformly excellent. And, oh, why not blow the whole thrust of the review in the first paragraph? Its art direction is terrific. Really, there's just one glaring flaw in Beat It, and it doesn't even affect the gameplay.  Beat It challenges you to listen to short musical tracks and then recreate them on a grid. The grid is split up into a handful of four-beat measures with each instrument occupying a row. At first, you just have two instruments to match up. However, later in Beat It's career mode (which is a tad too short), you are practically reassembling the beats of an entire band, from drum machine-style hand claps to bass drums to synthesizer. Each instrument sounds noticeably different so you never get lost in the sounds. The only caveat I can offer, though, is definitely play Beat it with headphones. The iPhone speaker just does not do a good enough job playing low register instruments. Without headphones, you will waste time with trial-and-error on these low instruments.   Bunnies love the beat.  While recreating the tune, you can tap a button to listen to the original sample again. As you place the notes on the grid, a line moves through the measures. If you have placed all of the correct beats for a specific instrument in a measure, they sparkle. This is an invaluable tool that makes Beat It immediately accessible. There are also a handful of power-ups you can use to blast unused squares off the grid or reveal the location of tricky beats. Once you have all of the notes and beats correctly placed and the line makes one complete pass through the grid, you win and are graded on speed and accuracy.  There are a handful of reasons I love Beat It. Not only is the gameplay described above exceedingly well done and fun, but the music in Beat It is excellent. The learning curve is friendly so casual players can try out the new rhythm puzzle without getting hammered on for making mistakes. Players that have dropped dozens of Friday nights into Rock Band parties (like me) will just love the fresh approach to making music. Plus, there is a great free play mode where you assemble your own short tracks. The tool grows as you encounter new instruments during the main game. Eventually, you have quite a little music machine. My complaint here is that you cannot share them with other players either as puzzles to play or just little musical treats. That's truly unfortunate and deserves to the rectified in an update.   Beat It! was reviewed with version 1.0.  ",

        "Content": "It's hard to believe that Sackboy is just a year old. It seems like only yesterday he burst onto our TV screens in LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation 3 and ushered in the era of \"Play, Create, Share\" \u2013 an era marked by 2D platforming and the ability to whip up your own levels and post them online for all to enjoy.  Now, Sony's portable is getting a dose of the good stuff with LittleBigPlanet PSP, and, in short, the game is great. I have a Platinum Trophy in LBP PS3, I often double back and play the game for our Level-Lovers feature , and still buy the DLC Media Molecule pumps out for the original title. My expectations were high for LBP PSP, and somehow the game managed to meet, if not surpass them.  Prepare for all sorts of heart-melting visuals in our Video Review.  If you somehow missed the cuteness invasion of '08, the LittleBigPlanet franchise is all about platforming levels \u2013 it's a polished, 3D, HD evolution of Mario Bros. You'll pilot an adorable little character named Sackboy through a bevy of missions that have you running, jumping and grabbing from one side of the screen to the other. That's it \u2013 you have just three inputs, but the results are anything but simple. Levels have you throwing musical switches to play tunes, leaping through complicated mazes that rotate as you walk, riding floating lanterns into the sky, and so much more. LBP might seem simple on the surface, but where the game shines and where I had the most fun is when a level does something that's completely unexpected and dazzling \u2013 and that happens more often than not.  The point to this platfomring adventure is capturing the prize bubbles that give you items to use in your own creations. Yes, you get a blank slate and get to create whatever goofy level you want with the same tools the developers used for the content in the game. When you're done, you can upload the creation to the LBP servers, download other kids' work, play it, take pieces of it, and so on.  Don't get confused; LittleBigPlanet PSP is a completely new entrant in the Sony franchise but will feel very familiar to anyone who picked up the controller and gave Sackboy a chance on the PS3. The main menu is broken up into three planets \u2013 an Earth made up of levels from the developers, a moon where you can create your own levels, and a community sphere for you to download levels other folks have created as well as upload your own beauties. This is pretty much the exact same thing we saw last year, but the content is all different.  This time around, the main story has you gathering all the LBP Creators for a massive carnival. This developer content is going to give you more than 30 levels spread across seven themed worlds that will take you from the feet of massive 'roos \"Down Under\" to hanging from decorative lanterns in \"The Orient\" to the slopes of \"Alpine Run.\" Although Sony Cambridge took lead on this title and not LBP's creator, Media Molecule, this smattering of missions is once again an unexpected highlight. Catching sheep as they leap into the air before hurling them into a shearer, pulling out a giant ape's teeth, and dodging lasers for a brand new movie are all highlights this time around and they made me thrilled to be in control of Sackboy once again.   We gotta get outta this place. Although each world generally has you moving from one side of the screen to the other, deadly contraptions as well as massive spinning wheels hurling you across the screen keep things fresh along with visuals that give each place its own feel. There are point bubbles to collect, prizes to find, hidden levels to uncover, sticker switches to use, costumes to unlock for your character, and so much more.  All of this is leading up to you creating your own levels \u2013 or at least basking in all the free levels people have created and uploaded. For me, this was the biggest question mark about this game: how would the PSP handle creating and uploading user content? The answer is that it handles it pretty dang well.   In all honesty, I was a bit disappointed when I first got going with the creation stuff in LBP PSP. Because it's so similar to the PS3 version \u2013 the Popit Menu (the little toolbar Sackboy can pull up at any time) is almost exactly the same here and so are the bolts, strings, camera angles and so on \u2013 the few changes/limitations of the system standout pretty quickly to seasoned vets. Once you make a line of material with the brush tool, you can't come back and cut parts of it out with the brush tool. The game's nitpicky about letting you build things side to side; there are two planes to the level instead of three this time around, and by the end of my level the game would wig out if I selected one thing connected to all the other stuff and I'd have to watch as everything slowly came tumbling down.  Get the brain!  It was a frustrating learning process, but so was creating in the first LittleBigPlanet. The thing about LBP PSP is that it is its own thing; you're going to have to take the basics of what you knew from the last game, toss out the rest of the garbage, and start over. Once I did that, I had a great time.  There's some slowdown when you're floating through your massive level in Edit Mode (and once or twice in complicated levels) and I had the game crash a couple times when I was trying to back out of the editor, but these issues are easy to overlook when you realize that you're playing LittleBigPlanet on a handheld. When my \" Made From Lava, It's Ryan! \" level was nearly done and I was just decorating the set and tweaking my text, it occurred to me how awesome this experience truly was. I mean, I had created a level while riding the bus and watching a movie with my roommate. The hours I sunk into my LBP level on the PS3 were spent in a darkened living room and I felt like I had to build in massive chunks. Here, I can literally turn the PSP on, work for a few minutes, and turn it back off. It's always there, it's always ready to be tweaked, and it's just as satisfying as the PS3 version.  Another extremely satisfying part of this title is sharing all of this content. Now, you could pop in and play levels other people had created in the PS3 version of LBP, but you needed to always be connected to the Internet and loading these opuses could take a fair chunk of change. That isn't the case here.  Over on the Community Moon, you can connect to the LBP servers and download and store up to 250 levels straight to your memory stick (as long as you have the free megabytes needed). Once they're on there, you can disconnect from your WiFi hotspot of choice and play the levels whenever you want. Just like on the PS3, you'll rate the levels you've played, heart authors, and post high scores. All of that data will be transferred back to the LBP 'net when you connect to the Web again. It's a fairly seamless process, but the best part is how fast it all goes. It was taking me just a few seconds to download new levels. The progress bar jumps from 10 percent to 50 to 90 to done in a flash for these levels, which were about 160 KB in my test.  You, once again, have a seemingly endless supply of free content at your fingertips when you connect this game online, but this time, you can take it wherever you want. That's awesome.  In terms of looks, LBP PSP is simple but good. I could've gone for more detailed levels \u2013 they can feel empty at times -- but the cardboard platforms and dozens of Sackboy costumes look very good and will keep you visually entertained. If you want to talk about audio, LBP delivers once again in the way of some really catchy tunes that had me tapping my foot as I put Sackboy through his paces.  Share your love. "

        "Content": "The traditional formula of creating a character, becoming a hero and saving the day is nothing new to BioWare . After all, this is the company that introduced classic role-playing game experiences to gamers everywhere with titles including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. For Dragon Age: Origins , BioWare fleshed out its customary design by including radically different characters with unique backgrounds for gamers to experience. The result is that Dragon Age dwarfs other role-playing games in size and scale, and weaves in mature themes amidst a backdrop of chaos and destruction.  The plot of Dragon Age is extremely rich with details that unfold over dozens of hours of play. All of this is documented in your in-game codex, which tracks conversations, plot points and other elements of your journey. The general backstory revolves around the Darkspawn threat to the land of Ferelden. Darkspawn are a race of creatures born from magic users who attempted to become gods, but were cursed for their efforts. Led by the powerful Arch-demon, the beasts emerge from underground lairs every few hundred years in a swarming plague known as the Blight.   Check out the video review here (HD available).   The Darkspawn's destructive plots would succeed were it not for the Grey Wardens. An ancient order of elves, dwarves and humans, Grey Wardens dedicate their lives to hunting down Darkspawn wherever they go. It's been centuries since the Darkspawn appeared, and the signs of a new Blight are even more troublesome since the numbers of Grey Wardens have dropped precipitously. To make matters worse, Ferelden is bitterly divided by an internal war, making the repulsion of this threat harder than before.   Dragon Age Guide Defend Ferelden from the Darkspawn with our guide. Read the Guide \u00bb  This is the fractured world your hero or heroine inhabits, a world which can evoke Tolkien-esque imagery. Ferelden has an impressively vast history (as your codex will indicate to you through your adventure). The biggest issue,  that arises with the storyline of Dragon Age is that plot elements suffer from repetitiveness. Even though different cities house unique quest events, they all incorporate similar motivating factors \u2013 assassination, betrayal or murder. Even though the results of your actions vary, it can become a bit stale.  Not every single city needs Macbeth, King Lear or other Shakespearean styled machinations to drive the action forward.  The character creation reveals more of Dragon Age's depth and flexibility. You have three separate races (human, dwarf and elf) and three base classes (warrior, rogue and mage) to choose from. Additionally, your hero will have general skills, class-specific talents and specializations, which you can learn from manuals or other characters willing to teach you their arts. By the end of the game, your hero will feel like a true legendary Grey Warden with a full complement of abilities to destroy the Darkspawn.  Dragon Age provides a ton of customization without a level cap, so it's possible to take two characters with the exact same background and develop them in completely different ways.  For example, do you want a berserker that mows down enemies, a stealthy rogue that strikes from the shadows or a mage that wields the elements? These are only a few of the options you can explore as you grow your character.   Gather around the campfire -- it's story time! Selecting your character's race and class decides which one of six unique origin stories you'll explore. Choose your origin carefully, because this decision affects how the world treats and views you. Since each background starts in a different location, the origin stories play out in distinctive ways. As you travel on your journey, your character may return to the lands they hailed from, and people you knew will respond differently to you. For example, if you play a mage, you start out in the Mage's Tower.  Eventually, you'll return to the site of your training, and the instructors and guards of the tower will remember who you are and what you did as a young magician inside the tower walls.  The largest issue that I had with the Origin feature is that some of the background elements fade away too easily as the game progresses, becoming little more than an afterthought. For example, many of Ferelden's citizens are extremely prejudiced against elves, but this bias eventually just disappears. Considering that a portion of the game revolves around uniting Ferelden against the Darkspawn, it would seem like you'd have to address these issues of racism somehow, especially if you happen to be an elven character.  Simply tossing these endemic problems aside without any attempted mediation or resolution seems unrealistic and forced, and insults the plot of the game.   This is not to say that Dragon Age shies away from tough predicaments. While you can affect some decisions with the respective skill (like manipulating conversations by persuading or intimidating characters), Dragon Age frequently presents you with options that can radically change events -- opening up separate side quests while closing others off. Certain choices have longer-lasting impacts on the world, and some can even alter the overall story. For example, can you convince people to protect a town under siege that they would rather abandon, particularly if it they could lose their lives in the process?  Even the smallest decision can have a butterfly effect on the game (particularly if someone dies), which is both daunting and exhilarating at the same time.  On top of this, your decisions influence the relationships you have with your party members, improving or damaging their opinion of you significantly. Managing this balance is very important for a number of reasons. First, as a party member's opinion of you improves, you unlock permanent stat bonuses for that character, strengthening their role in your group.  Second, the more a party member trusts you, the more they'll open up, providing side quests that strengthen your friendship and allow them to teach their individual skills to other characters in your group and unlock specializations for everyone.  Third, depending on the character and the strength of your bond, you can have a romantic relationship with them. On the other hand, make decisions that they don't agree with or completely upset them, and they could choose to leave your group entirely.   Time to die, fiend! While it's fine to include a variety of relationships, the depiction of love feels rather wooden and romantic segments are censored to the point of being very awkward. But the far bigger problem is that you can essentially buy your party's affection with gifts, even if you've wronged them. It would seem more appropriate to have them refuse to go on missions with you until you complete a side quest to get back in their good graces, or risk them leaving forever. Considering how complex the interaction with your party members can become, that would be the more realistic way of handling relationships, but the current system feels like trite manipulation.  Of course, Dragon Age isn't just about exploration and relationships. There's combat as well. You can engage the enemy in one of three ways: fight in real time, pause the action and tactically determine your next attack, or set up fighting preferences for your characters. Of the three, micromanaging the battle with pauses after each command is the optimal way of engaging in combat. Trying to command in real time when you're frequently outnumbered is complete lunacy regardless of how fast you use quick commands on the keyboard. Inevitably, you'll go up against a creature or a \"boss\" enemy that will use tactics which require a more strategic approach instead of brute force. Selecting battle preferences for your characters works for a while and can be useful, but every now and then the character will disregard your commands and utilize basic actions instead of skills or abilities. Plus, even with preferences set up, characters frequently act on their own idiotic accord \u2013 choosing to attack enemies you don't want them to or running blindly into traps that they should be able to see and disarm. Combine this with your party's poor path finding skills, and you'll clearly want direct control over everyone.  Micromanagement does take a lot of time, but you'll get the most out of your characters. When a downed character is revived, Dragon Age penalizes your party in the form of stat-weakening injuries. If you have a well-balanced party, you can avoid these penalties while effectively creating combos to decimate your opponents. For example, you can cast a spell to freeze approaching monsters and have your warriors smash the creatures into pieces. Battle within the game is frequently a brutal affair, with spells streaking towards their intended target and clashing swords bouncing off shields and enemies.  Even more striking is the attention paid to kills and critical hits, and watching heads get lopped off, or beasts getting impaled are fantastic touches.  However, I had a couple problems with the battle system.  First off, the game doesn't really scale enemies to match your characters' levels, so after a while, some fights are designed to overwhelm your party with size instead of skill.  In fact, once you start to approach level 20,  many of the Darkspawn are killed in a matter of seconds, drawing out play unnecessarily.  Another issue is that everyone, regardless of their distance to a fight, looks like they walked through a slaughterhouse afterwards.  Why is my mage, who's a sizable distance from the fight, covered in red?  It seems like some of that blood could've been toned down especially since it takes a while to disappear.   Really, it'll all wash off with soap and water. The presentation in Dragon Age is sharp, but it isn't nearly as impressive as other games. In fact, some of the character models and graphics look like they are a few years old, so they don't pack the same visual punch you'd expect from such a high profile game. On a positive note, the ability to manipulate the camera viewpoints is useful and well executed.  An extensive amount of dialogue is included in a m\u00e9 lange of accents, some of which are done well while others are poorly performed. At least your party members will provide some moments of hilarity as they question, cajole and annoy each other during down moments of exploration. Your created character will exclaim random phrases every now and then in the midst of battle, but they are, for the most part, a silent observer.  That's fine, because the real star here is the music, which sounds like a Hollywood score for a fantasy movie.   "

        "Content": "As you can see above, the subheading for this review is: \"You got moxie, kid. I like that.\" That, however, wasn't the first entry. The original text \u2013 before being stricken from the record \u2013 was: \"A crate love story.\" Why? Because few modern series' have a love affair with the crate quite like Ratchet & Clank (R&C). The humble crate is \u2013 in most contexts \u2013 nothing but a cliche these days. That most archetypal, processor-friendly environmental object just isn't necessary anymore. Nowadays, unless a crate serves a functional purpose, it's an artistically bankrupt inclusion in a game. Unless you're Ratchet & Clank that is. In Ratchet & Clank, the piles and piles of bolt-filled crates that populate the levels don't make any sense, but they don't have to \u2013 they're a fantastic inclusion regardless.  Why? Because it speaks to the core of the gameplay. Strip away the platforming, the inventive mini-games and the gadgets, and Ratchet & Clank is about two things \u2013 destroying stuff and collecting stuff, and smashing up crates gives you both those things in one. They explode in a joyous shower of bolts, the currency of the series, which you can then spend on bigger guns to create even bigger explosions. It's the cycle of life. Sunrise, sunset.  Erm, yeah.    Anyway, R&C may be all about having your way with crates and loving every minute of it, but that's common knowledge. What a lot of people may not realise is just how important story and characters are to this series as well. And that's where having moxie ('the ability to face difficulty with spirit and courage' \u2013 thanks Free Dictionary ) comes in. A Crack in Time doesn't piss-fart around \u2013 this is Ratchet's biggest challenge yet. His last two adventures have led to this, and the future of his family and the Lombaxes, not to mention that of the Universe , hangs in the balance. As usual, the story is told with charm and humour through some fantastically animated cutscenes and amusing in-game conversations, and really provides a great framework for the action.  Speaking of which, while A Crack in Time builds on what has come before, it also \u2013 as you'd expect - has quite a few new tricks up its sleeve. Ratchet's gameplay is a great blend of fully fledged levels and smaller bite-size challenges. Regions of explorable space are unlocked sector by sector, and in addition to story locations \u2013 generally planets or space stations \u2013 the inky black is also littered with other challenges you can choose to do while tooling about in Ratchet's ship. You'll encounter hostile fleets to dogfight with, stranded vehicles that need towing and countless planetoids with combat and platform challenges. One may charge you with killing 60 enemies as you run (literally) around its surface, while another may take you through a gauntlet of familiar platforming tricks and traps. You'll be rewarded, not just with bolts, but other collectables, such as mods for your weapons or Zonis, which help upgrade your ship.    Then there are Ratchet's Gadgets, such as the Hoverboots, which let him zip along a few centimetres off the ground and slow his descent in the air. These are capitalised on by levels with speed boost ramps and large open areas where he can use them for quickly getting around. They can be a little unwieldy to control at times, but are a good addition. Another new inclusion is the OmniSoaker, which lets Ratchet suck up water, nectar and oil, each of which has its own puzzle solving relevance. We use the word 'puzzle' pretty lightly by the way, as you'll never be puzzling over anything for more than a second or two. Partly because the difficulty is pitched a little low, and partly because the game insists on telling you what to do a lot of the time.  Even so, they're good inclusions and fit in nicely with Ratchet's normal running, jumping, grappling and shooting gameplay. Clank also gets kitted out in some new gameplay duds. Not only does he find himself in the home of the Zonis \u2013 the Great Clock, which is located at exactly the centre of the Universe (give or take a few metres), but it turns out he has a pretty significant role to play in this place. We won't say any more obviously, but what this means in gameplay terms is that Clank gains some nifty time-related powers. He can throw out a large bubble of slow time, for instance, and he has a Chrono Sceptre, with which he can bonk enemies on the head, as well as use it to rewind time to repair any damage done to the Great Clock by Dr Nefarious \u2013 the villain of the piece.   Dr  Cooler still, however, is his ability to use Time Pads to create multiple versions of himself. This allows the player to record Clank doing things \u2013 stepping on switches to open doors or raise/lower platforms, and use those recordings to complete sequences to get through to the next area. These start out simple \u2013 make a recording of Clank moving to and standing on a switch so you can go through the now-open door, but become a bit more complex when you have three Time Pads to work with. They never quite get hard enough \u2013 a separate mode of challenges would have been awesome \u2013 but are satisfying nonetheless.   So Ratchet and Clank have their own separate gameplay thing going on throughout A Crack in Time, and both \u2013 gratifyingly \u2013 are really entertaining. The lion's share of the game, however, will be spent as Ratchet and that's for good reason, as he's all about combat that ramps up steadily over the course of the game, which is basically R&C's raison d'etre. As the game progresses you'll unlock new weapons at a steady rate, level up those weapons through use, and earn all sorts of mods for them, not to mention buying new armour, upgrading your ship and unlocking new gadgets. The progression really is great - the gameplay never stands still.  Not all the weapons hit the mark \u2013 we didn't really think much of the Tesla Spikes or Dynamo of Doom, for instance, but there are so many that a few average inclusions really don't damage things. Who could care less that the SixAxis controls for the Dynamo of Doom electricity ball is a bit wonky when you're running around with fully levelled up Constructo Bombs kitted out with proximity triggers and a Skyburst payload? Or unleashing Zurkon the Destroyer, a little assault hoverbot, to fight alongside you? Or timing when you let loose with the deadly mating call of the Sonic Eruptor - a genetically mutated Zenogote bioweapon \u2013 based on its breathing patterns? Or jumping about like a madman firing Buzz Blades? Or tossing out a Groovitron Globe to force your enemies to dance? You get the idea.    The weapons don't always feel like they're part of a set, but they're great fun to play with nonetheless, particularly as you're often pitted against large numbers of enemies in quite open areas. And yes, the gladiatorial contests are back, natch. Probably the biggest weakness of the weapons is that if you play it smart you won't ever be truly challenged. Sure, you might die once or twice, but every battle is easily surmountable \u2013 bosses included. This goes for the wider game too. It's hugely enjoyable, but your platforming or puzzle solving skills will never really be pushed, and the game seems determined to spell things out for you a lot of the time too.  To be honest, this isn't a huge problem, just a mild disappointment, and an indication that Insomniac is keen to lure new players to the series by pitching things a little younger than the old guard might want. Another example of this is Dr Nefarious, who is annoyingly overacted. We get it \u2013 he's quick to anger and the kind of villain who screams every sentence and jumps about like a mad-bot, but did you have to dial it up quite that much? The result isn't that funny and has no subtlety whatsoever \u2013 he's just a funny robot for kids to laugh at. Thankfully the rest of the cast is engaging.    Other aspects of the game have caveats too. The visual design is largely very good, but on a technical level the engine is still a bit behind the pack, so some areas look much better than others. It seems to struggle a bit with organic matter like plants and textures with any level of detail, so don't let the tropical technicolour first world, and its ugly race known as the Fungoids, turn you off. That's the engine at its worst. Anything man-made or flat shaded looks great, so give the game a futuristic city with blue neon signs and spotlights, hovercars zipping about the place, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 plain surfaces with simple designs, and you're up and running. Give it a ramshackle desert town perched amongst arid rocky hills and you'll have no complaints. Travel inside Clank's brain for a training sequence and you'll discover a stark white world, where memories are projected onto screens and where platforms comprised of hundreds of grey and blue blocks undulate gently, before rising to create a level surface as you walk across them. Gorgeous.  Animations are first rate too, with a huge amount of polish evident in every aspect. Ratchet and Clank's movements are super smooth, while the game incorporates an old school elasticity in enemies and objects to give them more character. Clank can knock back energy balls fired by mounted cannons, for instance, which results in the cannon platform flipping over to give him a surface to jump to. The way it's executed, however, is comical, with the movement of the platform more like a startled jellyfish than a hunk of metal. The weapon videos are a real treat too, and are presented in a highly stylised way \u2013 reminiscent of Ren & Stimpy, actually.   There's only one word for it. BLAU! "

        "Content": "If this review seems a bit late by IGN standards, that's because it is. While playing through the first portable outing in the MotorStorm franchise, I ran into a fairly significant snag: the online was giving me serious problems -- to the effect of locking up and then shutting down my PSP. Thankfully, it came down to a PSN ID error, so if you're running into the same roadblock I did, delete your PSN account from your PSP (head to the Account Management option in the XMB, hit Triangle and then delete the account, then create a new one).  It's a good thing I did wait for a solution, though, as it completed the sense that this is MotorStorm, without any corners cut or features lost; this is the complete package, and the online complement is one of the better handled ones available on Sony's little portable that could. Getting a podium placement at the end of a race will net you points which in turn help you level up ranking-wise and earn new customization unlockables. There's a full friends list complement, leaderboards and you can actually invite people through the game that will show up on your PS3 friends list when you end up signing on there, as well as opt to ignore players, all of which makes MotorStorm feel nicely tethered to the full, \"proper\" PSN experience.   Click the image to watch our latest videos. If the online feels solid, though, it's because so much of it piggybacks off the core game that you'll be slogging through for weeks offline. I'll likely sound like a broken record by the end of this review, but it really can't be overstated: this is MotorStorm as you've come to know it, complete with tons of track variety, multiple paths for the myriad vehicles that will attack those tracks and completely different handling characteristics for those same vehicles. Quite literally nothing aside from HD resolution and the graphical goodies that come with the power of the PS3 has been sacrificed in bringing MotorStorm to the PSP.  That's a big deal, because until now (and aside from some smallish PSN titles), the \"holy crap, this is just like a console game\" experience has been relegated to former PS2 franchises. Games like God of War: Chains of Olympus, Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters and, to a lesser degree, Gran Turismo have proven that you can indeed take some of the best PlayStation 2 franchises with you on the go without losing anything. Arctic Edge proves it can be the same with some PS3 games too, online experience and all.  At its heart, Arctic Edge plays exactly like its console forbearers; you're dropped into the middle of the titular racing festival, this time moved to the arctic circle, and will race up, down and around a huge mountain that offers a ton of variety in environments and track designs. You'll launch off huge jumps, manage boost temperature by driving through water or deep snow to cool things off and come to grips with the wild differences in how and where a two-wheeled bike drives vs. a big rig (or, now, a snowmobile and snowplow).   Expect the same great variety of vehicle classes. All this really means is variety, and a ton of it. The courses BigBig Studios designed feel remarkably different from each other, and some of them seem almost entirely new when raced in reverse. They're littered with shortcuts, alternate routes, different types of terrain, huge jumps and a healthy number of technical turns, all of which are slowly doled out in such a way that you'll learn how to take all of them with each of the vehicles in the game over time. There's over a 100 total races in the Festival (read: Career) Mode, plus Time Attack and Free-Play modes, the former of which can also be played online. In short, there's a ton of stuff to play through, and like the PS3 MotorStorms, the challenge level starts out light and ramps up significantly by the end of the Festival.   Thankfully, that difficulty curve isn't as rough as the PS3 games, but at about the same point (midway through the career), there's definitely a spike in the aggression and tenacity of the AI racers. They won't drive through you like they did in the first game, but you'll get nudges and find the rubberband-ish racers keeping up with you quite easily later on. In fact, by the end of the Festival, you'll have to demonstrate an intimate knowledge of where every type of vehicle should be tearing through a course to even have a hope of placing first.  If you can do that -- not to mention accomplish more than a few other tasks -- you'll be rewarded with Badges, essentially Arctic Edge's version of Trophies, which in turn unlock more customization options for your vehicle, including new paint, decals, wheels, lights, mufflers, struts and so on. They're a way to essentially help you stand out, though if I'm being totally honest, I didn't really make much use out of the feature after I'd earned the Badge for tricking out all my rides at least once. Still, if you want to roll in a hot pink snowmobile, you can do so with a bit of tweaking. Sure, it's only cosmetic, but given that each of the 8 different vehicle classes have three variants with different handling, there's at least a lot of customizable fodder for those that like to tinker.   Wrecks are a huge MotorStorm signature, and they're awesome on the PSP. What's perhaps most impressive about MotorStorm is that it feels like the soul of the console versions is alive and well here; nothing was trimmed out or scraped away in moving things to the small screen, so you'll see laser light shows as you round a huge bend or go soaring off a ramp for a good five seconds of hang time that'll take you over a set of oil pipes, for instance. There was a keen attention to detail in building the tracks to make them feel both hewn from artic terrain, and yet impacted by the arrival of a fleet of ships, hundreds of thousands of people and a menagerie of fuel-sucking vehicles. There's even a limited bit of interaction with the environment, allowing the bigger vehicles to drive across ice bridges to destroy them, forcing smaller, lighter vehicles into the trenches or the ability to honk your horn and cause an avalanche that can wipe out any following vehicles.  The game runs surprisingly well given that at times you'll be squaring off with more than a half-dozen competitors most of the time, with pack stars not suffering from too much in the way of framerate drops off the line (though it seems the more people you play with online, the more things tend to bog down). When you're out in the open, the game is incredibly smooth, and there's a great sense of speed in some of the zippier rides. The texture work is among some of the best on the PSP and little effects like sun flares when rounding some bends or the aforementioned laser light shows really do impress no matter how many times you see them. That a Photo Mode was provided, too, from the Pause Menu, allowing you to export shots to the XMB, is a nice touch indeed.  Aurally, things are just as impressive. The turbo sounds for a big rig are slightly different from that of, say, a buggy, and the engine noises are nice and beefy for all, even the sputtery two-stroke of the bikes. Horns are beefy and though you won't hear it much, there's a mild amount of environmental sounds too, so terrain can sound different depending on where you're driving. By and large, though, unless you're wearing a pair of headphones, the dominant audio streams are engine noise, turbo and the game's rather extensive soundtrack that sticks closely to the electronically-splashed bits of heavy rock from the previous games.   The track design is great and nicely detailed. Though the 20 tracks (including the great Celldweller remix of \"Propane Nightmares\" from series favorite Pendulum, plus The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, Motorhead and even Radiohead) are great, they can start to grate a bit halfway through the Festival. Thankfully, a custom soundtrack option was also provided, though there's limited control over how to play your tunes. Still, it's a welcome feature, and one that, along with the photo mode and online play, brings it in line with the latest console version quite nicely."

        "Content": "PixelJunk Monsters should have always been on the PSP. When the original came out on the PlayStation 3 -- followed by the island-adding expansion pack -- I dug it, but I could never see myself sitting down in front of my TV hour after hour to play the simple and entertaining but at times frustrating tower defense game in an attempt to perfect every level.  With the PSP and its ability to be with me on the train, in the bathroom, or on a bus, I totally can see myself not resting until I've nailed every stage and earned every rainbow.  If you somehow missed PixelJunk Monsters and PixelJunk Monsters Encore, you should read Ryan Clements' informative first and second review. Done? Good because the easiest way to explain PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe is that it's all the stuff from those first two games bundled with a bunch of brand new awesomeness.  Put the Tikiman in your pocket.  In the PixelJunk universe, you're a little Tikiman looking to protect his tribe (a bunch of potato-looking babies wrapped in blankets who are huddled in front of a hut) from wave after wave of invading beasts. There are giant spiders, rock creatures, and weird flying things. Saving the day boils down to walking up to the trees in the area and spending gold on defense towers that take the place of the foliage. These devices have radii you can see so that when an enemy enters the circle, the tower can shoot cannonballs, ice, arrows, or whatever its function is in an attempt to blast the baddies off the map. If you fail at killing the attackers, they'll make it to the hut and kill one of your dudes for every one of the bad guys that makes it there. Lose all your dudes, and you fail the mission.   PixelJunk Monsters on a UMD A quick update to this review: in April 2010, PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe, which originally could only be downloaded off of the PlayStation Netowrk, was released on UMD. The UMD packed all the content of the original release, but this time it was on a disc and cost just $10. As this was more or less a re-release of the same product, IGN did not re-review the game. The article you're reading covers the content on the UMD, although the price in the Closing Comments section has changed.  All of these evil waves are building up to a final boss monster that's going to stomp in and try to kill any of your remaining tribe members. To stop the big guy, it's usually a good idea to have your towers leveled up by then. There are a few ways of doing this. To begin with, the towers gain XP for fighting, so they can top out their own onscreen XP meters and move to the next rank of effectiveness. Aside from that, you can take your Tikiman to the tower base and let him dance to speed up the leveling process. Finally, you'll be collecting these turquoise gems as you beat bad guys which can be spent on your existing towers to make them all the better.  Still, you might not want to spend those gems too quickly. There are a dozen towers in PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe, but not all of them will be available to you when you start a level. See, the gems you're collecting can also be taken to the hut you're protecting and traded in for brand new towers. Sure, an upgraded cannon tower is good for smashing crawling creatures, but a Tesla Tower and its electrical attack deals more damage -- you just have to have the 10 gems and 250 gold to unlock and build it. Of course, even better in terms of damage is the Mortar Tower, but it's slower and costs more in terms of gems and gold. All the towers you know and love are here, but Deluxe also adds an XP-generating tower as well as a trap tower to trip up enemies.   Blast'em. If you're a PixelJunk vet, everything I just listed is old hat to you, and that's because Q Games really didn't mess with anything that made PixelJunk Monsters great, and gameplay is and always has been great in Monsters. Although the concept is so simple, the game quickly becomes a challenging piece of work as you try to \"rainbow\" levels by not losing any babies. It's pretty crazy to sit there and freak out because a lone spider was able to get around your four arrow towers and three cannon towers and pick off one of the potato people.  It's that drive to get that tiny rainbow over the level in question on the world map that makes Deluxe so appealing. I know a lot of people have complained about the game's spikes in difficulty -- and it does get really, really hard at times -- but an easy tower defense game isn't that interesting.   Aside from the new towers, there are also new enemies that float in on balloons that you need to shoot down with your anti-air weapons before pwning the now ground-bound creatures. In addition to those guys, Deluxe tosses in an entire new island of 11 levels called Gati Gati that bring more of the same tree-to-tower awesomeness you'd expect as well as a Tikihut to track your Medal Challenge Mode results, view concept art, and listen to the game's chill tunes.  However, the biggest addition to Deluxe is online play. Over on the PS3, PixelJunk Monsters Encore added ad-hoc play (which is also in Deluxe), but didn't give players the ability to play with folks across the Internet. With the PSP, you can do just that and the experience is pretty damn impressive.   Go for the gold. Here, a two Tikimen are unleashed on the same single-player levels. Each guy gets his own coin purse to fill with gold and use to create towers, but the duo will share gems. Thus, it's a co-op game with a bit of a competitive twist to try and get the gold before your teammate can and to spend the gems how you see fit. I can tell you, there's no better feeling in Deluxe then entering a level you had been struggling with in single-player and dominating it with an online pal.  Sadly, the results of your online conquests are only good for that session; it's not like you can beat a level in co-op and then go back to your single-player game and progress onward as if you had beaten the co-op part by yourself. It's actually a needed restraint because you have to unlock the other two islands in your solo game but all of the three island's missions are unlocked from the start in co-op.  On another down note, there's no voicechat in the game so if you're playing with someone who doesn't know what the hell he or she is doing, getting them to quit wasting gems or building meaningless towers is tough. There are a wide number of symbols you can use to grab people's attention, but there's always going to be some room for interpretation as to what a heart, exclamation point, tower, and tiki-head mean in a visual sentence. Thankfully you can text chat before the game to scope out players who aren't stupid and then add them to your in-game friend list after the match so you can find them again. You can even bookmark worthwhile rooms to return to at a later date.   Not Wave 5! With PixelJunk Monsters already being pretty established, the players I've teamed up with have had a good head on their shoulders, but I've only been able to eke out a couple of games since the title went live last night. More good news is the fact that the games I've played have been lag-less and a lot of fun, so yay!"

        "Content": "It's easy to forget sometimes that there's more to racing that simply beating everyone else to the top the podium, dousing yourself in champagne from an oversized bottle of Dom Perignon . Racing is about lateral thinking. It's about aggression. Precision. It's also about mastering the corners and lines, learning the nuances of other racers and constantly refining your skills. In short, racing is a lot more cerebral than you might expect \u2013 and Need for Speed Shift is, without question, the most complete view of the rounded nature of racing available on a console today.  It is not, however, a simulation. It's not an arcade thrill-fest either \u2013 though, Shift is rarely short on action. What it is \u2013 which may come to as a shock to Forza purists as much as Burnout aficionados \u2013 is a game that strikes a wonderful balance between the two extremes of racing, blending elements of deep simulation and customization with a Kudos (Project Gotham Racing)-like system that rewards your skills, style, daring and creativity.  The real question is: by trying to please everyone, does Shift actually alienate both extremes of racing? The answer lies in the progression system that sits at the heart of Shift. Called 'Driver Skill Points', you're rewarded for just about any on-track manoeuvre \u2013 from revving your engine at the optimal intensity and clean or dirty overtakes to spinning out your rivals or performing a perfect corner. Moreover, during a standard race, you'll have optional objectives, such as earning 800 points, performing a 3-second drift or spinning out four competitors. These net you yet more points \u2013 and critically \u2013 more stars for unlocking events and higher tier levels.   Check out this bad boy in action by clicking above.  All of these elements are tracked on-the-fly and are tallied at the top of the HUD (which can be turned off for pure immersion) and totalled to give you an ever-increasing rank as a driver. Effectively, the Skill Points system takes the 'grind work' out of the constant struggle for place before all else. It really underlines the studio's understanding of the two very different markets who'll be interested in this game too \u2013 players who want action in a racing game, and players who want t to immerse themselves in the thrill of competition alone.  The beauty of this structure is, if you're not in the mood for being competitive, then objectives are waiting to be completed. Simply focus on getting that perfect lap, nailing every corner or obliterating your rival's ride. It's your choice \u2013 and you'll be rewarded regardless. Oh how you'll be rewarded.   Need for Speed Shift is a game with a fixation on instant-gratification, perfect for the Trophy/Achievement-whore generation, who constantly need to be patted on the head for just about anything they do in the game. In addition to the standard line-up of Achievements and Trophies, the Shift experience is all about tracking your accomplishments as a race driver. As such, every time you enter a slipstream, take a great corner, pull a best lap time and so on, you'll begin to earn badges. These badges, including supremely challenging 'master badges' eschew towards either 'Aggressive' or 'Precision' disciplines, ultimately giving you (and your online rivals) a nifty insight into your on-track method.  You're always earning something \u2013 new tracks, decals, events, cars and money. If you've ever become bored by the grind, Shift really does address this \u2013and frankly, it's to be applauded.  The structure of the game, as touched upon earlier, hinges around Tiers. At each level, a new range of applicable performance vehicles becomes available, as do special invitational events and a lot of themed events. The split between European, US and Japanese car models makes for a great set-up for international events, ensuring that you're earning enough to stock at least a couple really strong cars for each region, just so you can compete.   As immersion goes, it's hard to go past cockpit view. It's surprisingly functional - if a little dark at times.  Customisation and car-hunting, forever the long-term goal for any racing gamer, is fairly well catered for, with a total of 72 cars to unlock. It's not going to hold up when compared with rival titles, but generally speaking, Shift cuts out a lot of the low-end rides and gives you a good cross-section of performance vehicles and some stunning classic cars, including this writer's favourite, the Skyline 2000 GTR. Mmm.  Garage spaces are initially limited, which is fine; you'll unlock a lot more as you progress towards level 50 in your career.  Paint jobs and obligatory trashy decals aside, tuning isn't forgone in Shift. Rather, it's there for players who want the depth they've come to expect after years of Gran Turismo conditioning. Like the Tiered structure of the career, each level of upgradeable car part must be earned, which again, all relates back to your rank, money and desire to pursue pure racing or aggressive style and points. Eventually, in a (arguably unnecessary but nonetheless welcome) nod to previous street-style Need for Speed games, you can unlock nitrous tanks for speed boosts at critical moments.    As the world is whizzing past you at a couple hundred kilometres an hour, Shift makes it very easy to forget where you are. The two most immersive views place you inside a fantastically useable cockpit view, or just above the hood of your car; the reflection mapping on the latter is spot-on. Each of the game's dozens of tracks (and variants) are beautiful to behold, lavished with stunning HDR lighting, intelligent use of texture work and just enough background details to keep the scenery feeling live and not just static and removed from the track.  The car models, while excellent on the whole, do seem to lag a little behind in the polygon count in some instances \u2013 and up close, decals and on-car textures aren't nearly as sharp as they could be. However, the damage model is one of the most convincing we've witnessed \u2013 and we haven't even touched on the collision immersion yet. Taking a hit from another car or colliding with a stack of tyres is a bone rattling, vision blurring and overwhelming experience. You really don't want to crash \u2013 but at the same time, there's a wonderful sense of physicality to your point-of-view that not many racing games have nailed nearly as well as this.  On the sound front, the choice to keep music turned off by default is a bold move. It also allows you to appreciate the subtleties of the soundscape as your wheels glide across different surfaces; the roar of engines as they scream past you (or you past them).   Smoke 'em if you got 'em.  Surprisingly, Need for Speed Shift is a little light on extra bells and whistles \u2013particularly content sharing and social elements. We can't help but wonder if this is 'planned obsolescence' in action; by not including video sharing and viewing or car design exchanges and similar, it makes us a little fearful that we're going to be staring at a Need for Speed Shift 2 before too long. We wish EA had just gone for broke with this one \u2013 utterly jam-packing it with genre-leading content to compliment its tightly constructed gameplay and structure. Load times are also a small thorn in Shift's side; on average, loading a new track takes anywhere from 25 to forty seconds on Xbox 360. It's just long enough to become grating.  At least there's a robust multiplayer component to Shift, combining your career achievements with eight-player multiplayer racing. By competing for the same points that contribute to your lifetime rank, as well as for cold, hard cash, there's an increased value to taking proceedings online. Any friends who are also working their way through Shift will be compared to your times, giving you a great at-a-glance idea of how your lap times stack up. It's clever integration of traditionally separate content like this that show how thought through Shift actually is. Great stuff. "

        "Content": "  The first record I ever listened to was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I was six and lucky to experience The Beatles at such a young age. I sat and listened to the entire album from start to finish, then listened to it again. And again. The Beatles have been a part of my life since some of my first memories. So for me, The Beatles: Rock Band is the ultimate gift, crafted for anyone who loves the Fab Four. There's a care and attention you won't see from Activision's Metallica or Aerosmith one-offs. This is a labor of love.  But as you can tell, it's special to me because The Beatles have a place in my heart. First and foremost, you have to like The Beatles to even bother with the third iteration in the Rock Band series. After all, there are only 45 songs on disc, all of them coming from The Beatles' brief but prolific recording career. The Beatles: Rock Band can't interface with the previous two games and all upcoming Beatles downloadable content is only usable with this game. It is a singular entity -- a sort of private Hall of Fame for the greatest band that ever lived.   You can hop right in to Quickplay (online or offline) and enjoy the full track list (minus one song), if you like. There are no costumes to unlock, no characters to create. You play as The Beatles and their hair styles and wardrobe change to match the look from when a particular song was first played. This lack of customization might bum some folks who've grown accustomed to making an outlandish band, but after playing through The Beatles: Rock Band, I think removing these options is one of the better decisions Harmonix made. While playing \"Get Back\" on my plastic guitar, I never once thought, \"If only Paul had a Viking helmet and an eye patch.\" In eight years, The Beatles not only made dramatic changes in their music, but in their appearance. It's actually just as stunning to see the evolution of their look as it is to experience the growth of their musicianship.  The focus of most people's initial playtime will be the Story mode. This takes you through The Beatles' career, from their early days at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, England to their final performance on the rooftop of Apple Corps. You only need to play each song once, rather than the traditional Rock Band formula of recycling songs to extend your playtime. This is the best way to allow people to see the changes that occurred over The Beatles' all-too-brief career.  In their earliest phase, The Beatles were nothing more than a boy band. Sure, they had charisma and talent, but they weren't pushing music to new limits. The songs in this era are catchy tunes, fairly easy to play, and fun at parties. From The Cavern Club, The Beatles move on to the Ed Sullivan Show. Beatlemania has hit -- and you really get that sense playing in Shea Stadium and Budokan.   Would you let one of these guys hold your hand? If you turn on the \"realistic\" option in the menu, the crowd's volume is pumped up to the point that you can barely hear some of the lyrics amidst the screams of teenage girls. The stadiums have been faithfully recreated and there are some great reactions from the audience as well as the overwhelmed police officers tasked with containing the crowd. It's a little odd that Japan's Nippon Budokan stadium is filled with American teenagers, but The Beatles: Rock Band isn't striving for perfect historical accuracy. The scenes in these arenas is enough to make anyone realize why The Beatles felt they had to give up touring. Who could create great music when girls shriek every time Paul bobs his head?   Halfway through Story mode, The Beatles give up touring to focus on making albums at Abbey Road Studios. Showing the Fab Four sitting in a studio for twenty songs would get a little boring, so Harmonix created dreamscapes for each song recorded during this period. These wondrous, fantastical environments are custom-crafted for each song and have a visual style unlike anything I've seen in a music game. Harmonix transports us from the reality of the studio into a dream world that seems to have limitless possibilities. For the first time, people don't have to play a music game to have a good time. They can just sit back and watch the dreamscapes, marveling at the imagery.  George's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is one of my favorites. It doesn't have the whimsy of the \"Yellow Submarine\" or \"Octopus' Garden\" dreamscapes. Instead, it takes place on a simple hillside, where the once bright sky grows dreary as the mournful song progresses. The trippiest dreamscape of all is \"I Am the Walrus,\" which puts The Beatles in their Magical Mystery Tour animal forms -- it's some of the weirdest stuff I've seen in a game in a long time.   Just about every song is precluded by audio taken from the studio and/or rooftop sessions and there are even some variations if you play songs multiple times. This really brought me in and made me feel as if I was just an inch closer to being the fifth Beatle.  Story mode ends with a half-dozen songs on the roof of Apple Corps. Though The Beatles played this rooftop concert before recording Abbey Road (which you'll have played through earlier in Story mode), it was a smart choice to end this way. Let It Be was meant as a \"return to basics\" for The Beatles and that really comes through in this final videogame hurrah.  Through Story mode, you can also unlock a ton of photographs chronicling The Beatles' history. Each image comes with anecdotal information verified by Sir Paul, himself. There are also a half-dozen short videos to unlock. The first video you unlock happens to be the best -- the entirety of The Beatles' Christmas album, sent to members of the fan club. \"It's been a really gear year for us,\" John says.  To add a bit of replay value, each section of the Story mode has its own Chapter Challenge. The challenge is always the same -- beat all of the particular chapter's songs in one playthrough, getting five stars on each song. The difficulty setting doesn't matter (though you can't change it mid-way through a challenge) so you could just set it to easy and burn right through to collect the remaining photos. Or you can be a true gamer and play through on hard or expert, which makes the final few Chapter Challenges quite a bit tougher.  The photos and videos are a great addition, but they (and the cut-scenes between chapters) offer a very brief glimpse at The Beatles' career. A lot more could have been done to illuminate the full history of the band and the Fab Four's impact on modern music. For example, the soon-to-be-released The Beatles Box Set contains a short four-minute-long documentary for each album. Adding these would have provided a more robust look at The Beatles.   Is this a music game revolution? The Beatles: Rock Band is less about being \"a game\" and more about enabling people to experience The Beatles in a brand new way. Though their creativity was far beyond anything we'd heard before, The Beatles weren't known for their technical mastery of their instruments. Don't get me wrong; George has a handful of wicked guitar solos, a few of the vocals can be tough to nail on higher difficulties, and Ringo's drums will definitely keep you active. But this is not at all the same type of progression typically found in music games. Past Rock Band and Guitar Hero titles have taught to believe that music games are about starting easy and progressing into impossibility. That's just not what The Beatles: Rock Band is about. If you want an epic challenge that makes your fingers fall off, you won't find that here.    Credit Harmonix for staying true to its formula of not manufacturing difficulty in songs. If the song doesn't call for an impossible guitar riff, they aren't going to force it in there. Ultimately, the lower difficulty doesn't bother me, because The Beatles: Rock Band gives me an emotional experience that I don't get from any other music game.  While I'd love to spend thousands of words detailing the changes and updates to the gameplay, there's really no need. The Beatles is almost identical in play to Rock Band 2. The major change is the addition of vocal harmonies. Up to three mics can be used so that you and your friends can butcher The Beatles' harmonies together. Vocal assignments aren't given -- that is, no one is designated as being lead or backup vocal #1 or #2. Anyone can sing any part they like whenever they like. All you have to worry about is filling the vocal meter for one of the three parts in each phrase. But if your duo or trio can nail both the lead and backup vocals, you can earn Double Fab and Triple Fab bonus points. Screwing up the harmonies won't hurt you, so there's no harm in trying. Surprisingly, three-part vocal harmonies is the toughest thing to master in The Beatles: Rock Band.   Not a bad way to cap off a career. The one other addition worth mentioning is something new in the Training mode.  Aside from the vocal harmony training, there's something called Beatle Beats. Here you can master more than 80 of Ringo's classic rhythms. Completing these sections requires you to play them at an expert level, which is not so easy unless you are already an expert on drums.  The Wii edition of The Beatles: Rock Band is virtually identical to the PS3/X360 versions. It features full online functionality (including the ability to download new songs) and has some impressive visuals. There is aliasing in the Wii version, but it otherwise holds its own. The one thing to note is that the disc costs $59.99, which is $10 more than the standard Wii title. You get nothing extra for this -- just the right with play as The Beatles."

        "Score": 9.0,
        "id": "e1b18d00f40e133365538bdb2c92bd35",
        "Content": "If you have fond memories of classic action-oriented role-playing games like the very first Legend of Zelda or Link to the Past on the Super NES, then Gamevil's Zenonia is a love letter written expressly to you. This is a fantastic, old-school adventure with deep roots in previous generations, as the young hero Regret must solve the mystery of what happened to his father. But before he can learn exactly what happened and why he is the focal point of evil demons, much blood will be spilled... and literally hundreds of items will be collected.   Gamevil argues that there are over 40 hours of gameplay in Zenonia . That's likely a conservative estimate. There is a primary storyline that runs through the heart of the game, but there are dozens upon dozens of side quests you can accept or deny. These side quests do serve as the means to grind a few levels and increase your strength and pocketbook, but they also have great effect on the definition of your hero. How you behave in the world affects your good/evil rating. These ratings change not only the way other people view you, but also nudge the story in different directions. You really could play through Zenonia a couple times, trying different choices to see where the adventures takes you next.   Zenonia is a stunner.  Battles in Zenonia unfold in real-time instead of the turn-based system you may recall from franchises like Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior. You walk up to a monster (some of them are disarmingly cute) and tap the attack button to swing your weapon. From time to time, you land critical shots that do incredible damage -- and are accompanied by a satisfying flourish. Getting close puts you in harm's way, though. Enemies will return the favor and slash you with their weapons, occasionally imbuing you with extra damages, like temporarily lowering your defense or evasion skills.  However, battles are not just button-mashing contests. There is a smart skill tree system in Zenonia that truly lets you customize your hero's capabilities. The skill tree is split into two halves: active and passive. The active skills are mostly means for attacking while the passive skills affect your well being and defensive measures. As you level up your hero, you can choose different skills to learn and upgrade. You can place skills on a quick access bar along the bottom of the screen so they are always at the ready. Provided you have enough power to employ them, you can mix up battles by slashing away and then tapping a skill to land a ferocious blow.  This system keeps the game relentlessly fresh. Trying different skills and approaches on enemies -- and there are a lot of different enemies in each overworld area -- is great fun. I was surprised how easily I slipped back into old habits of milling around areas, just grinding through stages to get powerful as early as possible. Once you gain a couple stages and learn a new skill, you move into more hostile territory and try out bigger enemies to earn even more experience and money. The key to success in old-style games like Zenonia is to be willing to spend some time smashing low-level enemies (which is always relative to your current level) just to level up. If you stay a few levels above where Gamevil imagines you will be when you reach a hard monster, the chances of falling significantly decrease.   Many, many fat loots await you in Zenonia.  The loot system in Zenonia is also very cool. There are hundreds of items to find, collect, and forge into new gear. Enemies will sometimes drop items when you kill them, but you will also find stuff in treasure chests, at shops, and at special merchants that appear only at night. Items are spread across five categories: normal, magic, rare, unique, and epic. Finding something unique in Zenonia is a real treat, kind of like how a World of Warcraft or Diablo player feels when they discover some awesome gear.  Zenonia also digs a little deeper than past action-RPGs and uses systems like night-and-day to affect the world, as well as a weight mechanic that literally slows you down if you try to carry too much loot.  Of course, none of this cool stuff means anything if the game doesn't control well. Zenonia employs an on-screen virtual d-pad and an attack button for controlling Regret. For the most part, they work great. Occasionally my thumb would slide off of the d-pad and I wouldn't move when and where I wanted to, thus resulting in getting smacked by an enemy. The attack button is flawless, though. Plus, the game is very smart about implementing an auto-targeting system so Regret attacks monsters that are closest to him, even if you press the attack button while he is facing a different direction.  The menu system is many layers deep, and here is where Zenonia can sometimes turn frustrating. The d-pad is touchy, and the slots/buttons in the menus are very small. Quite often, I would accidentally move to a different menu tab or overshoot a desired item.  Zenonia is absolutely gorgeous. The hand-drawn sprites are wonderfully detailed and expertly colored. In fact, the entire game pops off the screen thanks to the great color choices. The world features -- trees, houses, wells, beaches, fountains, cacti, ice -- are universally attractive. The artists at Gamevil deserve serious kudos for their efforts. This game looks better than a Game Boy Advance game (and that system produced some stunning RPGs) and veers into DS territory. The music is also exceptionally good.   Zenonia was reviewed with version 1.0.  "

Just this month alone there are at least a half dozen great titles hitting the system, and if the current stream of pocket goodness continues, there will be a whole lot more for 2009.  What the  DS didn't have until now, however, was a half platformer, half puzzle game, which featured an old man that spoke Banjo Kazooie-like gibberish, drank tea, and turned into a gigantic super robot.  This would be a system first\u2026  First of all, if you're a fan of Tetris Attack, Astro Boy (GBA), Mega Man X, Castlevania, traditional Mario games, or last year's sleeper hit Drawn to Life, Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a must-buy.  The team over at EA Tiburon that spawned this gem of a DS game knows classic gaming, and has thrown in chunks of nearly every major action/platformer (or at least philosophy behind them) out there.  Hatsworth may don a cute look, a strange concept, and an \"ageless\" visual style, but it's pure fun.  High concept level design, combo-based brawling, sub-weapons, wall jumps... this game was classically influenced.  The general design for Henry Hatsworth is a unique but simple one. Players control a doddering old man that's a sort of half-adventurer, half-washed up crackpot.  Rocking a strategically placed monocle and safari hat, Hatsworth is out to discover a set of golden clothes said to be worn by powerful \"gentleman\" throughout the ages, and with a snickering anti-hero hot on his trail, the race for the greatest golden knickers on the planet is off.  Gameplay on the top screen is classic action/platforming, including elements from nearly every design school out there, and it comes together really well.  You'll find combo attacks, pop-up and chase maneuvers for mid-air battling, dashes, wall jumps, butt stomps, sub-weapons, melee and shooter elements, a combo system, upgradable skills in a gem-based God of War/Astro Boy system, and plenty of classic platforming goodness.  All the level design elements you'd expect to see are there too.  Hatsworth slides on ice, dodges pits, encounters screen-freeze areas where a barrage of baddies attack, takes to underwater areas (complete with low gravity, higher jumps, and air bubble \"push\" areas), and plenty of good old fashioned platforming.  As a particularly impressive note, new enemies are being introduced evenly throughout the entire game, but that number quickly moves from a dozen or so to nearly 30 different types by my count.  This game just keeps bringing more and more to the table.  But this is the Puzzling Adventure, right?  So what's up with that match-three game on the bottom screen?  The link between the \"puzzle realm\" and Hatsworth emerges from the very beginning of the game, and it's an integral part of the design.  Enemies and item pick-ups all make their way down to the bottom screen, where Tetris Attack (Planet Puzzle League) is played.  Removing three or more blocks at once will add to your puzzle meter \u2013 which fuels your robot transformations, as well as sub-weapons \u2013 and while the top screen freezes during puzzle mode, the puzzle will slowly scroll as you focus your attention back on the top screen, so you'll need to balance between removing enemies that could potentially respawn, cashing in match-three for more supers and bigger weaponry, using the puzzle to solve platformer areas (fill in missing blocks, or the like) or cashing in on support items that lurk on the bottom screen.  The real challenge here was blending the two game types, and it totally works.  Each screen feels like its own game, but they're also tied together very well.  Depending on enemy type, different blocks move down into the puzzle.  During boss battles, specific attacks will render the bottom screen useless or add in new immobile areas of the puzzle that need to be worked around to remove.  For as many enemy types as there are in the game, there's an equivalent number of ways the team has messed with the classic Tetris Attack formula, and it keeps things fresh on both screens.  My worry was that each of the two sections of the game would feel like half-games.  That's simply not the case.  With Henry Hatsworth, you're getting a full-on action/platformer, and a full-on puzzle game too.  If you could cover up and disable one of the two screens, you'd still have what feels like a polished, robust offering for each respective genre.  There are still some downsides to look out for, but the good far outweighs the bad.  The game can be pretty unforgiving at times, having knock-back on attacks, and placing enemies in tough locations during demanding gap-jumping.  It never gets too overbearing, but Hatsworth is always walking the line between a game for the younger crowd, and one to satisfy the hardcore.  By the time you hit world three or so, it's on to some pretty demanding gameplay.  In addition there are a few little changes I'd love to see for a sequel, but nothing that's game-breaking in any way.  The down/attack is the most powerful regular move in the game, but I've had some poor luck with it as well.  Hatsworth keeps his collision, and oftentimes he'll attack, but also be blown back from getting hit, making it a tough one to feel comfortable with using.   As a very minor gripe, the game's juggle system makes for some great gameplay, but since it relies on you popping up baddies and keeping them airborne in combos long after they've died (an awesome concept), you don' t have a chance to go pick up some of the loot they drop in the process.  I would have loved to purchase an upgrade that sucked gems towards Hatsworth, but when that's the biggest of my concerns, it should be pretty obvious that this game is the real deal.  Other than that, I found that a lot of areas \u2013while extremely fun \u2013 gave me a serious sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.  Level design is strong, but I feel like I've seen most of it before, and not until later in the game do levels truly catch up to the innovation of the rest of the game.  Stages are also pretty long, but the game auto-saves after each chunk of a level, so you can always turn it off and pick up where you left off.  Lance Banson:  Great boss, or greatest boss?  When all is said and done though, the good far outweighs any slight issues I've encountered, making this one of the most original and well-crafted platformers on the system, and what I'd consider to be the best DS platformer since New Super Mario Bros.  The gameplay is sound, but on top of that the style is hilarious as well.  Characters speak ridiculous gibberish, bosses and enemies have a nice slice of over-the-top humor to them, and the attitude found when blending the visuals, character designs, and sound is seriously impressive.  If I could have the music from Hatsworth's boss fight against Lance Banson (Sky Pirate Magazine's Handsomest Most Eligible Bachelor of the Year) playing on loop for every boss fight in any videogame ever, I would do it.  Fighting a sky pirate is fun, but fighting a sky pirate while he sings to you in a beautiful opera ballad donning a half-open pink shirt to compliment his gold, flowing hair is a different beast altogether.

        "Content": "Change can be a painful process. Just ask one of the unfortunate citizens of Kijuju, the fictional region of Africa that serves as the setting of Resident Evil 5, the latest entry in Capcom's ongoing zombie videogame saga. A power-mad corporation's evolutionary manipulations have caused a biological disaster that turns people into mindless hosts for a military-grade parasitic infection. And you thought the Bird Flu was nasty.  The citizens of Kijuju are going through some ugly changes, many of which involve tentacles, oozing eyeballs and heretofore unexplored bloodlust. And, as is the custom in a Resident Evil game, you drop into the situation woefully underprepared for what awaits. The resulting experience is an intense, action-packed adventure replete with satisfying combat, tight gameplay and gorgeous, well-crafted environments. Resident Evil 5 offers all those things and then some, but it doesn't do many of the things longtime fans of the series expect. It won't scare you. It won't fill you with creeping desperation. It won't have you collecting and counting bullets like they're precious stones. It won't, in essence, make you feel like you're playing a traditional Resident Evil game.   Limited Edition Content  The Resident Evil Collector's Edition comes with a box full of things you really don't need and probably don't want. In addition to the game itself, you'll get a bonus disc with a documentary and trailers, a messenger bag, a patch, a necklace and a figurine. All this for $89.99. Yes, you read that right. Out of all that, the game is the only thing worth your money, and you can get that for $30 cheaper on its own. The good news is the game comes in one of those metallic cases that have become so popular lately. It's a nice, sturdy case with a slick black cover that will look nice on your shelf. The bad news is it comes with a bonus disc of features that will make your eyes cry. Included on the disc are The Making of Resident Evil 5 documentary; The Art of Resident Evil 5; and a trailer each for Resident Evil: Degeneration and Resident Evil: Extinction. All are in standard definition and all look pretty awful.  The documentary has some interesting interviews with Capcom developers such as producer Jun Takeuchi, co-producer Masachika Kawata, production director Yasuhiro Anpo and cinematic supervisor Yoshiaki Hirabayashi. Unfortunately, the quality of the documentary does not match the quality of the game. The art is also presented in standard definition and isn't sortable. It's just a collection of 109 images that you have to manually click through. And then there are the trinkets. While I'm normally a fan of game figurines (the ladies love me), the Chris Redfield character that's included in the RE5 Collector's Edition doesn't look anything like his in-game counterpart. He looks more like Seth Green. So what's the point? Also included is a Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance patch (have fun getting through airport security with that on your jean jacket) and a light cotton \"messenger bag\" with the Tricell logo on it. It looks sharp enough, but it's not exactly built to last. Rounding out the packing list is a pewter pendant in the shape of Africa that hangs from a black leather thong. And yes, Madagascar is attached. Now, not everyone can get away with sporting an Africa pendant, which hasn't stopped me from wearing it around the office. Don it at your own risk. Here's a full list of everything that's included:  Metal case Game Bonus disc Tricell messenger bag B.S.A.A. patch Africa pendant Chris Redfield figurine To sum up, Resident Evil 5 is a great game that's well worth your cash. But the Collector's Edition is not. It comes off as an attempt by Capcom to squeeze extra money out of fans without delivering that value that they've come to expect from the company. I'd pass on this one.   Like the story it's trying to tell, Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution. Capcom has gone out on a limb with the latest numbered sequel in its long-running survival horror franchise, and although one of your goals as a player is to survive the horrors around you, this entry in the series is a radical departure from the genre Capcom helped create near Raccoon City more than a decade ago.  You'll start out the game as Chris Redfield, who fans will remember as one of the co-stars of the original Resident Evil. But Chris is no lone wolf. Joining him on his mission is Sheva Alomar, an African national and bioweapons expert. Both Chris and Sheva are members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, a global outfit tasked with preventing the proliferation of \"biological organic weapons.\"   IGN Insiders can see the RE5 Head-To-Head between the PS3 and 360 versions right here .   And to date, the group has done a pretty poor job of it. From the incident at the Arklay Mansion (RE1) to the outbreak in Raccoon City (RE2) and the Las Plagas infestation in Spain (RE4), the B.S.A.A. and its predecessors such as the S.T.A.R.S. team have been one step behind the Umbrella Corporation and its mysterious backers. When we last left the story of Chris Redfield in Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, he and fellow former S.T.A.R.S. member Jill Valentine were battling through Umbrella's Russian base. So why isn't Jill at Chris's side in RE5? It's a good question, and one you'll have to play the game to answer.     This time around, it's Sheva who has Chris's back, and she'll be with you every step of the way, whether you go it alone or recruit a friend to play along. On your first playthrough you're stuck with the beefy Chris, whose bulging biceps and gigantic torso make Street Fighter IV's Ken look like a stick figure. Once you complete the game, you unlock the ability to play single-player as the more compact Sheva, who can handle herself and just about everything else.  There are several scenes in RE5 where the more acrobatic Sheva will need to part ways with Chris to reach hard-to-access areas. It's a cool nod to the co-op nature of the game, but I felt Capcom could have gone farther with the concept. There are no moments when you truly feel separated from your partner, which could have upped the fear factor significantly. Part of the horror of past RE games lay in the cramped isolation of knowing you were all alone in a dark corridor. But here, you're never truly on your own, as Sheva is always at your side.  When Sheva is controlled by the game, she does a pretty fair job of staying out of your line of fire, watching your back for enemies and healing or reviving you when you take damage. But just like any partner, she does have her annoyances. In RE5, as in other games in the series, each character is limited to a set number of inventory slots, and making the best use of that space is one of the keys to doing well in the game. In single-player mode, you have access to both characters' inventories, and you can swap items back and forth between them as you see fit.     But Sheva likely doesn't have quite the same fanatical approach to ammo and health conservation that you do. She's a bit trigger happy, even when her targets aren't perfectly presented, and she tends to heal herself and Chris at the slightest sign of a flesh wound. But beyond that, I found her to be at the same time both refreshingly unobtrusive and surprisingly intelligent, as A.I. partners go. Some players will hand her a few weapons and let her loose on Kijuju, while others will likely restrict her inventory and use her as more of a pack mule.  If you're a hardcore fan of the previous Resident Evil games, you probably just shuddered at the thought of you're A.I. partner wantonly wasting ammo, which was notoriously scarce in earlier installments in the survival horror franchise. But to understand how the gameplay in RE5 is set up, you'll need to forget just about everything you know about the series.     Sure, there are parasite infected zombie-like enemies who want to kill you in Resident Evil 5, a situation that will be instantly familiar to fans. And there are some other through-lines as well. You can't run and shoot at the same time. Your inventory is limited. You can heal yourself by collecting and applying colored herbs. Weapons are upgradable. But there are also some looming differences.  For the first time in one of Resident Evil's main numbered releases, cooperative play has been made the cornerstone of the experience. Nearly every aspect of RE5 is more fun with a friend, either online or via split-screen, which is available in both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Just fire up a second controller, hit the Start button and join in. The game doesn't do a very good job of telling you how do accomplish this, but it's there nonetheless.     Split-screen play is handled a bit differently in RE5 than you might be used to. Rather than cut the screen evenly vertically or horizontally, Capcom has given each player an equal size horizontal offset rectangle, one on the upper left and one on the lower right of the screen. It's an odd effect at first, but the more I used it the more I liked it. Although there's less screen real estate in use, it's easier to stay focused on your own character because the two screens don't directly abut one another.  But most gamers will be playing Resident Evil 5's co-op mode as it was designed to be played: online. This is where RE5 truly shines, both literally and figuratively. With the screen all to yourself, you'll marvel at the beautifully rendered environments, from the dilapidated villages surrounded by golden sand to misty wetlands populated by shield-wielding tribesmen. And Capcom has included some major incentives to drink in your surroundings.     Scattered throughout the environments in RE5's six chapters are \"treasures\" that can be collected and sold for cash (some are also dropped by bosses and mini-bosses). You'll also want to be on the lookout for the B.S.A.A. emblems hidden here and there. Each one you find and shoot gives you points that you can later spend to unlock 3D models of the various RE5 characters. The detailed figurines are presented on pedestals like the vending machine capsule toys popular in Japan. It's a cool touch and just one of the many unlockable features that add to Resident Evil 5's high replay value.  One of the best rewards in Resident Evil 5 is the bonus of unlimited ammunition for fully upgrading a weapon over the course of the campaign. That's right, upgradable weapons are back, and they're a blast (see what I did there?) to use. There are shotguns, handguns, magnums, sniper rifles, grenade launchers machine guns and more at your disposal, and most of them can be upgraded into destructive beasts. And unlike Resident Evil 4, you don't have to wait for a wandering merchant to beef up your boomsticks. Just head to the inventory screen between levels and cash in your treasures or spend the gold you've picked up along the way.     There's been a fair amount of media discussion around the question of whether Resident Evil 5 has racist overtones due to its African setting and the fact that the main character (at least on the first playthrough) is a white man shooting black people in their native land. I personally didn't find Resident Evil 5 to have an overtly racist feel, but I did find one aspect of it a bit disturbing. It was a bit strange to realize I was wandering around Africa stealing the region's gold, precious gems and expensive native treasures, which I then cashed in to pay for weapon upgrades. Add in the fact that I ended up killing the parasitically infected villagers and townspeople of the area with said weapons, and the discomfort comes full circle.  But I long ago lost count of the number if videogames I've played whose in-game economies, storylines and character motivations made absolutely no sense. And I suppose the people of Kijuju won't be needing their treasures anymore anyway, seeing as they've all been infected with a parasite and then killed by me. Consider it money well spent on ridiculously powerful weapons.     If you play your cards right, you can finish the game with, say, a fully upgraded shotgun and then plow back through in the New Game+ mode with infinite shells. There are very few games that I've finished and then instantly fired up again for another go-round. Resident Evil 5 is one of those games. If you plow through without scouring every nook and cranny, expect RE5 to last you between 10 and 12 hours. But if you want to uncover everything, expect to easily invest double that. And even if you managed to find every treasure, every emblem and every secret the first time around, you'll still want to dive back into the game for the Mercenaries mode, which is unlocked when you complete the game. This timed arcade-like mode pits you against a flood of enemies, and you'll need to kill as many of them as possible until help arrives.  Mercenaries is the most edge-of-your-seat experience in the entire game, and the only time I truly felt scared of death at the hands of the infected horde. You can't bring your massive arsenal of upgraded weapons into the arena, and you'll need to scrounge for ammo and health just to stay in the game. In fact, Mercenaries was the only place where I actually actively avoided enemies rather than methodically hunting every last one down. RE5 didn't ship with the ability to play Mercenaries online, but Capcom has already released a patch that adds this functionality. Just connect to Xbox Live, pop in the game, and accept the auto-update. Mercenaries is a blast, and it is the part of RE5 that's most like the earlier games in the series, which emphasize caution, planning and conservation over running and gunning.     Actually, I should probably revise that to \"running and then gunning.\" With RE5, Capcom has essentially created an action game with some of the Resident Evil survival horror conventions laid over it. One of those conventions is the restriction of movement while shooting. Unlike a third-person shooter like Gears of War, which allows you to strafe and fire, Resident Evil 5 requires you to stand still while shooting.  It was a deliberate choice, and producer Jun Takeuchi has said he feels it adds to the intensity of the experience. This, along with the real-time inventory system (which is always restricted to nine slots and can't be upgraded) keeps RE5 in a sort of limbo between full-fledged action game and methodical survival horror game. I didn't mind the control style (which you can switch up with alternate layouts if you choose), but it does feel a bit outdated. Basically, if you played the demo and didn't enjoy the experience, then you won't like RE5, because what you see is what you're getting.     And what's amazing about that is just how successful Resident Evil 5 is as a game, despite its seeming reluctance to commit to one genre or the other. The levels are laid out and paced well, the weapons are balanced nicely and I never got bored moving from one infested area to the next. Past Resident Evil games pushed you along with fear and instinct, forcing you to move from one area to the next to stay alive. RE5 pulls you ahead, enticing you toward a clear objective with the promise of more killing.  The combat is truly the focus here, and the fight is at its best when you're tackling the baddies with a buddy. In addition to using the standard weapons and explosives, you're encouraged to get up close and personal with melee attacks, which are triggered via context-sensitive face button presses. Popping an enemy with one or two handgun shots will usually cause them to stagger a bit, which opens them up for a melee strike. Get in close, and a button icon will pop up. Hit it in time, and you'll pull off a flashy move like an uppercut, somersault kick or impaling stab. For the most part, these work smoothly, although there were times when I felt the game wasn't recognizing the opportunity for a melee attack as quickly as I would have liked.     The A.I. does a good job of recognizing when melee attacks are both advisable and effective, but you'll get the most bang for your buck when you're playing online. It's quite satisfying to work as a team to pull off impressive weapon-and-melee combos, and this teamwork approach carries over to the boss battles, too. Like every aspect of RE5, the bosses and mini-bosses (including the dreaded Chainsaw Majini) are best tackled with a partner.  Many of the boss battles involve quick-time events that require you to alternate between firing your weapons at an enemy and quickly pressing buttons at a specified time. Some of these mega-fights, like the one with the giant troll-like creature who wears a belt of dead people, are a real adrenaline rush. Others, like an early fight with a monster that needs to be burned in an incinerator, are more of an ode to past RE games where beating a boss was often equal parts puzzle solving and shooting.     Putting down a big boss rewards you with a bit of the RE5 storyline, which follows Chris and Sheva as they attempt to stop a suspected weapons deal being spearheaded by an unsavory fellow named Ricardo Irving. This gem of a character boasts some of the worst voice acting I've heard in a game in years, with the writing to back it up. Irving looks like a reject from a Miami Vice episode and talks like Jimmy Durante and Gilbert Gottfried's love child. But would it really be a Resident Evil game without the convoluted storyline, overflowing cliches and campy writing?  I can definitely report that silly storytelling and B-movie bad guys are a Resident Evil convention that Capcom left untouched with this release. As one character is rapidly evolving from a human into a hideous aquatic tentacle monster, he screams with glee, \"I just had an extreme makeover!\" Classic.   Ricardo Irving. He will make you laugh.   In some ways, Resident Evil 5 is more like the many motion pictures spawned by the earlier videogames in the series than those early games themselves. There's more action, more adventure, more explosions, more vehicles and overall more of an over-the-top thrill-ride feel. It's Black Hawk Down meets Resident Evil: Apocalypse instead of Resident Evil 4 continued. That's not a negative, but it's definitely a departure. And whether or not it sounds like a romping good time or the death of everything you know and love depends on your perspective. For my money, fun is fun, and RE5 has near infinite ammo in that department. "

        "Content": "Negligent parents and ambulance-chasing lawyers, your next target has arrived and it's a doozy. MadWorld , published by SEGA and developed by Platinum Games (formerly Clover Studios, best known for Okami and Viewtiful Joe) is so over-the-top violent and vulgar that by comparison the Grand Theft Auto series may as well be Mr. Rogers. In no other game, for example, can you grab hold of a leather-clad enemy and impale him anus first on a rusty spike, which penetrates his body and rips through his mouth in a bloody fountain on the other side. Uh-huh -- there's going to be some phone calls. But beneath the oceans of cinematically dismembered limbs, chainsaw-severed torsos and uncensored F-bombs, there waits a legitimately entertaining game supported by a compelling storyline, a breathtakingly bold style and some fun, engaging play mechanics to boot. MadWorld may ultimately not be for everyone -- its black and white presentation and unabashedly offensive content practically ensure that -- but those who do get it will absolutely love it. And for the record, I completely get it. Just like Okami and Viewtiful Joe before it, MadWorld looks like a beautiful piece of moving art. Director Shigenori Nishikawa has admitted to comic book influences like Sin City and parallels could certainly be drawn to unique movies like Renaissance, both of which feature similar black and white presentations. The style itself is not original, but we've never seen it done like this in a videogame before and the end result is a stunning success. Platinum Games wanted to create a title so distinct that when people stumbled upon it, they wouldn't be able to turn away -- and love it or hate it, MadWorld's graphics catch and hold the eye. The side effect to this design choice is that ultra-stylized works are perfectly suited to Nintendo's underpowered console, which struggles to render realistic environments, but is amply armed where art is emphasized over technology.    Watch our full video review by clicking on the link above  I adore the look. Not just the refreshingly different monochromatic makeover -- a veritable middle finger to the countless games out there that steal and re-steal the same boring style; two middle fingers to the publishers whose marketing teams may as well be credited as co-designers -- but the art and technology that made it a reality. Every unique character and environment in MadWorld has been lovingly crafted and rendered, the results nothing short of marvelous. The designs of the locales, from the intentionally cliche Asia Town or a horrific castle overrun by zombies and torture devices to an alien bunker complete with big-eyed grays and gravity guns, are simply dazzling. Some of the boss characters are so awesome and menacing that you might instinctually prefer to turn and run just as soon as fight them. The animation is quick and fluid and the particle effects system is one of the best Wii has ever seen -- it needs to be since the game is flooded in blood. The violence, which seeps into every nook and cranny of the title, runs so deeply that it is entangled in the very presentation. The black and white nature of the game is only compromised by the color red, which makes its presence known every time main character Jack, a ripped mystery man with a chainsaw for an arm, cuts an enemy in two, lops off a head, or pulls out someone's beating heart and crushes it. MadWorld is filthily brutal, never blinking in its quest to make mutilation funny. The concept might sound ridiculous, but the truth is that you will laugh as you battle your way through the grungy subways and Japanese dojos while shish-kabobbing enemies with long spears or blasting off their heads with golf clubs. It's all just so ludicrously overdone -- in the same way that Ash cutting off his own hand in Evil Dead 2 is -- that you can't help but giggle. And maybe that's why the game squeaked by with an M rating when Manhunt 2 -- in my opinion, the less violent game -- initially didn't.  Jack's trusty chainsaw is controlled intuitively with the Wii remote. I'm certainly glad it did because all of the blood and guts are a necessity here and the excessive gore is also your pay off for a job well done. MadWorld is by definition a beat-'em-up. Jack moves through areas and destroys any unlucky foe who crosses his path, but there are some welcomed twists on the old formula. For starters, the finishers, which are cinematic and rewarding ending moves that take out enemies once and for all. Wear a challenger down and you can exact one of these devastating maneuvers -- always stylized, gruesome and satisfying. Imagine breaking a foe's torso in half, slicing him to pieces with a katana, or using the chainsaw to cut him vertically from the groin up. Just watching the carnage unfold hurts. Platinum Games has also tied many of these finishers into environmental kills -- for example, a dumpster whose lid slams shut and slices enemies in two -- which smartly adds variety and an extra layer of dynamics and skill to the way you play. There's great diversity, but as you explore the world you will still inevitably encounter repeat kills, which is disappointing. I couldn't tell you how many times I slammed an enemy into a rose bush during the course of the adventure, but it was definitely a lot. The murders themselves are so brutal and funny, not to mention beautifully rendered, however, that their eventual repetitiveness -- an unavoidable side effect of any beat-'em-up -- is a little easier to forgive. Additionally, the developer has created an assortment of kills exclusive to certain regions, some of them weapon-based and others environmental. You won't see the gravity gun until much later in the title and you won't be able to hurl enemies into a piranha-infested fish tank in any stage except the zombie courtyard, for example. Combined with some of the mini-challenges that await, you will never feel as though you're continuously doing the same thing, even if some of the actions repeat. The aforementioned mini-challenges are peppered throughout the game and are not only humorously twisted, but engaging, and they also provide a welcomed change of pace from the traditional action. The Black Baron, a self-described pimp, introduces these violent games, all of them timed, and then you compete for points. In Man Darts, you pick up a spiked baseball bat and swing away, sending bloodied enemies soaring at a giant, nearby dartboard -- of course, you'll score more for bulls-eyes so aim well. The Rocket Reamer mini-game sends a blazing fast train down the tracks directly in your path; your job is to throw as many enemies as possible in its line of sight and then watch as the carnage unfolds. There are 10-plus of these so-called minis throughout the experience and they are all enjoyable for different reasons, their only shared trait the buckets of blood spilled in their names. Aside from the minis, there are a couple of gameplay-changing sequences in the game in which Jack must ride a motorcycle while fending off baddies. Although far from bad, these are the weakest scenes in the game, mostly because they lack genuine variety. You drive a lot and you chainsaw some thugs -- there's not much more to the experiences.    Click on the above link to watch our 15-minute full-level walkthrough  Platinum Games has utilized a very simple, but effective control scheme and as a result MadWorld is immediately playable. Jack himself is controlled tightly with the nunchuk's analog stick and pointer functionality is tossed to the side for a combat system that relies heavily on smart gestures. Not waggle, mind you, but simple gestures to effect many of the previously noted finishers. The hulking anti-hero throws vicious punches every time you tap the A button and B-Trigger pulls out his chainsaw, which can be swiped horizontally or vertically with your respective motions. Too often, action games overuse gestures or merely replace buttons with stupid waggle, but neither is true in MadWorld. The controls feel well thought out and responsive, as evidenced by the fact that Jack's primary action, punching, is mapped to a quick button press while his secondary function, the chainsaw, is motion-based. Why more developers don't understand something so simple as this repeatedly befuddles me. Finishers require only simple gestures -- up or down, left or right, and the results are gore-tastic. Nothing's complicated. Everything makes sense. Well, almost everything. MadWorld's camera system could have benefitted from a little more fine-tuning. The camera is manually manipulated, but your options are limited. You're able to center Jack's point of view -- that's it. A rotational camera assigned to minus / plus or even to left / right on the D-Pad (ultimately utilized for weapon equip) would have much improved the situation. Instead, you will sometimes find yourself running toward the screen, turning around and tapping the camera button to re-center. It doesn't help that the same button is used for enemy locks -- a welcomed feature that I wish was likewise more fine-tuned. You have to hold the camera button for a second or two to gain a lock, which can be frustrating during an intense battle. None of these issues are insurmountable, but issues they remain.  In Asia Town, ninja ride Ninja. The otherwise fluid controls are complemented by a good combo system that encourages creative kills. You earn points for every murder you make, but those numbers are multiplied when you string together extra vicious mutilations. For instance, you might trap an enemy in a tire, stab him several times with street signs and then slam him into a wall of spikes -- the entire act will earn you several times the point value you'd garner if you had simply butchered the foe with a chainsaw instead. This combo system plays heavily into the action and if you don't respect it, your quest will be more difficult. This is because new mini-challenges and boss fights will only open after you've amassed a certain number of points and, thus, if you always go for the easiest kills, you'll spend a lot more time killing foes than you would if you'd used your imagination. The points system also carries over to the mini-challenges. If you perform poorly in a game of Man Golf, an ideal excursion for points, you will find yourself stranded afterward, only able to advance to the next trigger spot after you've battled hordes of enemies. I like the concept powering the combo system -- stringing together brutal kills for more points is a fantastic idea. However, it never runs very deep and usually comes back to the same three props: tires, street signs and rose bushes. Most of the combos are simple variations of these. There's still fun to be had in creating these wicked multipliers, and yet I simultaneously wish the system was more varied and dynamic, not to mention primed for competition. Given that there's no achievements or online leader boards, competitive gamers will never feel the compulsion to go for gold. Any combo-based shortcomings, however, will be obliterated the second you encounter the game's first real boss. His name, ironically, is Little Edie, but he towers over Jack in a truly fabulous, cinematic cut-scene that triggers the battle to come. There's a wide array of boss characters in MadWorld and every last encounter is awesome, from the opening sequence to the final, gory death animation. The deeper you progress through the title, the less it clings to any sort of reality and the stranger the bosses become -- and I really enjoy this about the game; it doesn't even try to take itself seriously -- it's just a game. Werewolves, sure. Giant robots? Check. I won't spoil any more, but the face-offs are always engaging and intense, the designs of the baddies ridiculously amazing. The bosses all have their strengths and weaknesses and there's some good strategy to be had in finding those out. The only gripe I've got here lies with the progression and namely that the final showdown in Jack's quest seems slightly anticlimactic compared to some of the gargantuan, thrilling monsters and murderers you square against with before you get that far.  You will find yourself smiling and wincing simultaneously at the excessive gore in the game. I've referenced some specific characters, weapons and locations to make some points in this review, but I've steered clear of general story spoilers because the tale powering MadWorld is deeper than I had originally suspected and I want you to discover it for yourself. You probably already know that Jack finds himself in Varrigan City's Death Watch, a disturbing game show in which contestants -- the area's inhabitants -- battle to the bitter end in a fight for survival. Everybody, including otherwise-innocent civilians, seems fit to take part in this nasty game because the mysterious terrorists who've taken over the city and erected Death Watch have also released a poison into the air and only those who fight are given the antidote. It's easy to shrug off a story in a beat-'em-up -- traditionally, they're not very good -- but bear in mind that Yasumi Matsuno of Final Fantasy fame penned the exposition in MadWorld. The end result is by no means exceptional, but the writing is strong, there are a number of twists and turns along the way, some cliches slashed, and it's all backed by excellent production values. The voice acting is also moody and believable.  The game's black and white art style is boldly original and gorgeous. Speaking of which, SEGA and Platinum Games contracted celebrity voice actors Greg Proops (Whose Line is It, Anyway?) and John Dimaggio (Bender from Futurama) to voice the two lewd and crude commentators who call all of the so-called plays Jack makes as he progresses through the ranks of Death Watch -- a great move. These guys are hilarious. Not only is the writing stellar -- some great jokes, all of them as vulgar as possible -- but the two share a flowing, smooth dynamic and their delivery is impeccable. They're not afraid to drop F-bombs or go back and forth about each other's wives, and the comedy always feels unrehearsed. The game is additionally backed by a superb hip-hop soundtrack comprised of 20 songs from various established and up-and-coming rap artists. The beats are exceptionally moody and catchy, adding great ambience to the game, but also providing tunes that will have you moving your feet as you slice and dice your way to victory.  There are only two problems with the entire aural presentation, as far as I'm concerned. The first is that the announcers, vocal rap soundtrack and sound effects occasionally bleed together in a cacophony of sound -- usually when you've got your chainsaw buzzing. The much bigger issue is that much of voice work for the thuggish characters repeats way too often, which is annoying. If you make your way into a horde of enemies, every single one of them might say \"I'm going to get you, motherfu$@#er!\" within 30 seconds of each other. This oversight happens repeatedly throughout the game and is definitely a noticeable shortcoming. If you judge the quality of a game based on how long it is, MadWorld might not be for you. The initial play-through only takes about five or six hours to complete, typical of a beat-'em-up. Of course, I would argue that you will have more fun in this five or six hours than you would in 20 with some lesser title. Regardless, though, there is reason to return to the experience, particularly if you are a completionist. First, you can play MadWorld on normal and hard modes. In too many games, the distinction is practically meaningless, but not so here. Consider that I died only a handful of times as I played through the game on normal mode. Now consider that I died a half dozen times as I attempted to play through the tutorial mode on hard difficulty. It's the real deal, as evidenced not only by the smarter AI for enemies, who suddenly dodge your attacks and laugh at you before fighting back, but also by the fact that you only have a single life when you start (as opposed to three) and that enemies inflict multiple amounts of damage with every punch. A couple of well-placed attacks and you're a goner. There's also weapon unlockables for completing the game on normal mode that can then be used when playing through on hard. And there are Death Watch game minis that become available after you have completed a stage once. There's definitely good replay value here, even if at first glance the content seems slim. And if the challenge of playing on hard isn't enough, Platinum Games has also included a two-player split-screen mode where you and a buddy can compete in the various mini-challenges, like Man Darts, from the single-player adventure. The split-screen mode sees a small framerate hit, but it is otherwise intact and still enjoyable, although I would have preferred an online cooperative option.  Just one of the epic bosses that await main character Jack. "

        "Content": "Change can be a painful process. Just ask one of the unfortunate citizens of Kijuju, the fictional region of Africa that serves as the setting of Resident Evil 5 , the latest entry in Capcom's ongoing zombie videogame saga. A power-mad corporation's evolutionary manipulations have caused a biological disaster that turns people into mindless hosts for a military-grade parasitic infection. And you thought the Bird Flu was nasty.  The citizens of Kijuju are going through some ugly changes, many of which involve tentacles, oozing eyeballs and heretofore unexplored bloodlust. And, as is the custom in a Resident Evil game, you drop into the situation woefully underprepared for what awaits. The resulting experience is an intense, action-packed adventure replete with satisfying combat, tight gameplay and gorgeous, well-crafted environments. Resident Evil 5 offers all those things and then some, but it doesn't do many of the things longtime fans of the series expect. It won't scare you. It won't fill you with creeping desperation. It won't have you collecting and counting bullets like they're precious stones. It won't, in essence, make you feel like you're playing a traditional Resident Evil game.  Like the story it's trying to tell, Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution. Capcom has gone out on a limb with the latest numbered sequel in its long-running survival horror franchise, and although one of your goals as a player is to survive the horrors around you, this entry in the series is a radical departure from the genre Capcom helped create near Raccoon City more than a decade ago.     You'll start out the game as Chris Redfield, who fans will remember as one of the co-stars of the original Resident Evil. But Chris is no lone wolf. Joining him on his mission is Sheva Alomar, an African national and bioweapons expert. Both Chris and Sheva are members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, a global outfit tasked with preventing the proliferation of \"biological organic weapons.\"  And to date, the group has done a pretty poor job of it. From the incident at the Arklay Mansion (RE1) to the outbreak in Raccoon City (RE2) and the Las Plagas infestation in Spain (RE4), the B.S.A.A. and its predecessors such as the S.T.A.R.S. team have been one step behind the Umbrella Corporation and its mysterious backers. When we last left the story of Chris Redfield in Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, he and fellow former S.T.A.R.S. member Jill Valentine were battling through Umbrella's Russian base. So why isn't Jill at Chris's side in RE5? It's a good question, and one you'll have to play the game to answer.  This time around, it's Sheva who has Chris's back, and she'll be with you every step of the way, whether you go it alone or recruit a friend to play along. On your first playthrough you're stuck with the beefy Chris, whose bulging biceps and gigantic torso make Street Fighter IV's Ken look like a stick figure. Once you complete the game, you unlock the ability to play single-player as the more compact Sheva, who can handle herself and just about everything else.     There are several scenes in RE5 where the more acrobatic Sheva will need to part ways with Chris to reach hard-to-access areas. It's a cool nod to the co-op nature of the game, but I felt Capcom could have gone farther with the concept. There are no moments when you truly feel separated from your partner, which could have upped the fear factor significantly. Part of the horror of past RE games lay in the cramped isolation of knowing you were all alone in a dark corridor. But here, you're never truly on your own, as Sheva is always at your side.  When Sheva is controlled by the game, she does a pretty fair job of staying out of your line of fire, watching your back for enemies and healing or reviving you when you take damage. But just like any partner, she does have her annoyances. In RE5, as in other games in the series, each character is limited to a set number of inventory slots, and making the best use of that space is one of the keys to doing well in the game. In single-player mode, you have access to both characters' inventories, and you can swap items back and forth between them as you see fit.   IGN Insiders can see the RE5 Head-To-Head between the PS3 and 360 versions right here .  But Sheva likely doesn't have quite the same fanatical approach to ammo and health conservation that you do. She's a bit trigger happy, even when her targets aren't perfectly presented, and she tends to heal herself and Chris at the slightest sign of a flesh wound. But beyond that, I found her to be at the same time both refreshingly unobtrusive and surprisingly intelligent, as A.I. partners go. Some players will hand her a few weapons and let her loose on Kijuju, while others will likely restrict her inventory and use her as more of a pack mule.     If you're a hardcore fan of the previous Resident Evil games, you probably just shuddered at the thought of you're A.I. partner wantonly wasting ammo, which was notoriously scarce in earlier installments in the survival horror franchise. But to understand how the gameplay in RE5 is set up, you'll need to forget just about everything you know about the series.  Sure, there are parasite infected zombie-like enemies who want to kill you in Resident Evil 5, a situation that will be instantly familiar to fans. And there are some other through-lines as well. You can't run and shoot at the same time. Your inventory is limited. You can heal yourself by collecting and applying colored herbs. Weapons are upgradable. But there are also some looming differences.  For the first time in one of Resident Evil's main numbered releases, cooperative play has been made the cornerstone of the experience. Nearly every aspect of RE5 is more fun with a friend, either online or via split-screen, which is available in both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Just fire up a second controller, hit the Start button and join in. The game doesn't do a very good job of telling you how do accomplish this, but it's there nonetheless.     Split-screen play is handled a bit differently in RE5 than you might be used to. Rather than cut the screen evenly vertically or horizontally, Capcom has given each player an equal size horizontal offset rectangle, one on the upper left and one on the lower right of the screen. It's an odd effect at first, but the more I used it the more I liked it. Although there's less screen real estate in use, it's easier to stay focused on your own character because the two screens don't directly abut one another.  But most gamers will be playing Resident Evil 5's co-op mode as it was designed to be played: online. This is where RE5 truly shines, both literally and figuratively. With the screen all to yourself, you'll marvel at the beautifully rendered environments, from the dilapidated villages surrounded by golden sand to misty wetlands populated by shield-wielding tribesmen. And Capcom has included some major incentives to drink in your surroundings.  Scattered throughout the environments in RE5's six chapters are \"treasures\" that can be collected and sold for cash (some are also dropped by bosses and mini-bosses). You'll also want to be on the lookout for the B.S.A.A. emblems hidden here and there. Each one you find and shoot gives you points that you can later spend to unlock 3D models of the various RE5 characters. The detailed figurines are presented on pedestals like the vending machine capsule toys popular in Japan. It's a cool touch and just one of the many unlockable features that add to Resident Evil 5's high replay value.     One of the best rewards in Resident Evil 5 is the bonus of unlimited ammunition for fully upgrading a weapon over the course of the campaign. That's right, upgradable weapons are back, and they're a blast (see what I did there?) to use. There are shotguns, handguns, magnums, sniper rifles, grenade launchers machine guns and more at your disposal, and most of them can be upgraded into destructive beasts. And unlike Resident Evil 4, you don't have to wait for a wandering merchant to beef up your boomsticks. Just head to the inventory screen between levels and cash in your treasures or spend the gold you've picked up along the way.  There's been a fair amount of media discussion around the question of whether Resident Evil 5 has racist overtones due to its African setting and the fact that the main character (at least on the first playthrough) is a white man shooting black people in their native land. I personally didn't find Resident Evil 5 to have an overtly racist feel, but I did find one aspect of it a bit disturbing. It was a bit strange to realize I was wandering around Africa stealing the region's gold, precious gems and expensive native treasures, which I then cashed in to pay for weapon upgrades. Add in the fact that I ended up killing the parasitically infected villagers and townspeople of the area with said weapons, and the discomfort comes full circle.  But I long ago lost count of the number if videogames I've played whose in-game economies, storylines and character motivations made absolutely no sense. And I suppose the people of Kijuju won't be needing their treasures anymore anyway, seeing as they've all been infected with a parasite and then killed by me. Consider it money well spent on ridiculously powerful weapons.     If you play your cards right, you can finish the game with, say, a fully upgraded shotgun and then plow back through in the New Game+ mode with infinite shells. There are very few games that I've finished and then instantly fired up again for another go-round. Resident Evil 5 is one of those games. If you plow through without scouring every nook and cranny, expect RE5 to last you between 10 and 12 hours. But if you want to uncover everything, expect to easily invest double that. And even if you managed to find every treasure, every emblem and every secret the first time around, you'll still want to dive back into the game for the Mercenaries mode, which is unlocked when you complete the game. This timed arcade-like mode pits you against a flood of enemies, and you'll need to kill as many of them as possible until help arrives.  Mercenaries is the most edge-of-your-seat experience in the entire game, and the only time I truly felt scared of death at the hands of the infected horde. You can't bring your massive arsenal of upgraded weapons into the arena, and you'll need to scrounge for ammo and health just to stay in the game. In fact, Mercenaries was the only place where I actually actively avoided enemies rather than methodically hunting every last one down. RE5 didn't ship with the ability to play Mercenaries online, but Capcom has already released a patch that adds this functionality. Just connect to Xbox Live, pop in the game, and accept the auto-update. Mercenaries is a blast, and it is the part of RE5 that's most like the earlier games in the series, which emphasize caution, planning and conservation over running and gunning.     Actually, I should probably revise that to \"running and then gunning.\" With RE5, Capcom has essentially created an action game with some of the Resident Evil survival horror conventions laid over it. One of those conventions is the restriction of movement while shooting. Unlike a third-person shooter like Gears of War, which allows you to strafe and fire, Resident Evil 5 requires you to stand still while shooting.  It was a deliberate choice, and producer Jun Takeuchi has said he feels it adds to the intensity of the experience. This, along with the real-time inventory system (which is always restricted to nine slots and can't be upgraded) keeps RE5 in a sort of limbo between full-fledged action game and methodical survival horror game. I didn't mind the control style (which you can switch up with alternate layouts if you choose), but it does feel a bit outdated. Basically, if you played the demo and didn't enjoy the experience, then you won't like RE5, because what you see is what you're getting.     And what's amazing about that is just how successful Resident Evil 5 is as a game, despite its seeming reluctance to commit to one genre or the other. The levels are laid out and paced well, the weapons are balanced nicely and I never got bored moving from one infested area to the next. Past Resident Evil games pushed you along with fear and instinct, forcing you to move from one area to the next to stay alive. RE5 pulls you ahead, enticing you toward a clear objective with the promise of more killing.  The combat is truly the focus here, and the fight is at its best when you're tackling the baddies with a buddy. In addition to using the standard weapons and explosives, you're encouraged to get up close and personal with melee attacks, which are triggered via context-sensitive face button presses. Popping an enemy with one or two handgun shots will usually cause them to stagger a bit, which opens them up for a melee strike. Get in close, and a button icon will pop up. Hit it in time, and you'll pull off a flashy move like an uppercut, somersault kick or impaling stab. For the most part, these work smoothly, although there were times when I felt the game wasn't recognizing the opportunity for a melee attack as quickly as I would have liked.     The A.I. does a good job of recognizing when melee attacks are both advisable and effective, but you'll get the most bang for your buck when you're playing online. It's quite satisfying to work as a team to pull off impressive weapon-and-melee combos, and this teamwork approach carries over to the boss battles, too. Like every aspect of RE5, the bosses and mini-bosses (including the dreaded Chainsaw Majini) are best tackled with a partner.  Many of the boss battles involve quick-time events that require you to alternate between firing your weapons at an enemy and quickly pressing buttons at a specified time. Some of these mega-fights, like the one with the giant troll-like creature who wears a belt of dead people, are a real adrenaline rush. Others, like an early fight with a monster that needs to be burned in an incinerator, are more of an ode to past RE games where beating a boss was often equal parts puzzle solving and shooting.     Putting down a big boss rewards you with a bit of the RE5 storyline, which follows Chris and Sheva as they attempt to stop a suspected weapons deal being spearheaded by an unsavory fellow named Ricardo Irving. This gem of a character boasts some of the worst voice acting I've heard in a game in years, with the writing to back it up. Irving looks like a reject from a Miami Vice episode and talks like Jimmy Durante and Gilbert Gottfried's love child. But would it really be a Resident Evil game without the convoluted storyline, overflowing cliches and campy writing?  I can definitely report that silly storytelling and B-movie bad guys are a Resident Evil convention that Capcom left untouched with this release. As one character is rapidly evolving from a human into a hideous aquatic tentacle monster, he screams with glee, \"I just had an extreme makeover!\" Classic.   Ricardo Irving. He will make you laugh.   In some ways, Resident Evil 5 is more like the many motion pictures spawned by the earlier videogames in the series than those early games themselves. There's more action, more adventure, more explosions, more vehicles and overall more of an over-the-top thrill-ride feel. It's Black Hawk Down meets Resident Evil: Apocalypse instead of Resident Evil 4 continued. That's not a negative, but it's definitely a departure. And whether or not it sounds like a romping good time or the death of everything you know and love depends on your perspective. For my money, fun is fun, and RE5 has near infinite ammo in that department. "

        "Subtitle": "Improve your reputation by pursuing liberation.",
        "Content": "Some of them are more useful than others. Strength and Star, for example, just give your units a minor stat boost. Tower, Justice and Hermit are a little bit flashier, since they each attack the enemy with a different elemental magic. And Death is probably one of the most interesting, since it can instantly kill a foe on the spot. Using it, though, will lower your reputation.  These are all the names of tarot cards, each one an example of one of the most unique and memorable gameplay mechanics found in Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen , which is both a classic Square Enix strategy RPG and the latest addition to the Wii's Virtual Console lineup. The cards come into play fairly frequently throughout the adventure -- that first set of examples being drawn from their usage in battle sequences.  Choosing whether or not to use a tarot is one of the only actions you can take in combat, actually, as Ogre Battle's battles are almost entirely automatic. You field your forces, you set up their formations and select one of four basic attack strategies ahead of time. But after one of your units encounters the enemy, it's pretty much hands-off -- no menus to navigate, no choosing \"Attack\" or \"Magic\" or \"Item\" and then pointing a cursor at a character on the screen. It's all handled for you, in cut-away scenes starring some much more detailed and attractive sprites than you'll see on the map screen.    The autopiloted combat gives you more mental bandwidth to be able to concentrate on the greater strategy unfolding on that map screen, though, where the majority of the action takes place. Ogre Battle's all about controlling land area, ultimately, as the game is separated out into chapters and each chapter has its own unique terrain. Plains, rivers, mountains and forests must all be traversed by your many fighting men, on their way to liberating towns and temples from the control of the villainous Zetegenian Empire.  Liberating towns and temples, then, gives you places where your units can be healed, go shopping for spells and upgrades and earn money to fuel the ongoing war effort. And every time you free one of these places (a simple matter of making it to them on the map, cutting a path through any enemies in your way) you get to draw a tarot card. Everything comes full circle.  Ogre Battle is an incredibly deep and involved strategy RPG, and even that description of its gameplay so far is just scratching the surface -- this is a game where you'll also be recruiting new allies, searching for hidden treasures on the battlefield, managing your reputation with the citizens of the country (because a better reputation means a better ending at the quest's conclusion) and more.  Reputation is actually another of Ogre Battle's more interesting (and somewhat intangible) inclusions. It's a factor that's first formed in the game's intro sequence, which involves a fairly lengthy questionnaire conducted by Ogre Battle's resident wizard/tutorialist Warren Moon -- he quizzes you on your ethics, morality and leadership style, and your starting rep and soldier set is based on your responses.  The questions, of course, are all based on that same tarot set. And the questions are randomized every time you begin a new playthrough.  It's details like that that have made Ogre Battle one of those games you could discuss for days, and play for weeks. Even play through multiple times, because of its multiple endings. And so several fans have, over the years. Ogre Battle was originally released for the SNES here in America in 1995, and in the decade and a half since then it's gained a dedicated cult following. Its elusiveness, too, has made it all the more intriguing for strategy fans -- that's thanks to the rarity of its original cartridges, as only 25,000 copies of the title were ever produced.",

        "Content": "Take Halo 3. Pause the game mid-combat. Now, pull the camera out of the back of Master Chief's skull and position it high above the battlefield. Resume play. That's Halo Wars - or at least, that's certainly the best way to describe how it looks \u2013 all the chaos of the far-future battlefield, the intricate animations, spectacular lighting effects, swarms of grunts and spiralling grenades \u2013 and there you are, with your cursor conducting the chaos and destruction like any good strategy gamer should.  There's a heck of a lot more to it than that, of course; something that will dawn on you as you exert your direct commands in this Ensemble Studios creation that takes the Halo universe into fresh and challenging new territory. To some extent, Halo Wars is derivative as a real-time strategy game. It relies on the same systems of unit management, resource and technology management and multitasking that have made as many fans of the genre as it puts off. However, with the console-only focus comes a refreshing emphasis on action and speed over complex tech trees and endless staggered menu systems.  As the story goes, the events of Halo Wars take place 20 years before the original Halo on Xbox \u2013 an era where the human-led UNSC are fighting a losing battle against the ever-growing Covenant threat across planets in various stages of colonisation. There are also plenty of Spartans alive and kicking, as well as ODSTs (Orbital Drop Shock Troops) and a host of cool new battlefield armaments to raise all sorts of anachronistic questions; it's the Star Wars paradox all over again.    Seeing as Master Chief isn't around yet, the story is told through the perspectives of Captain James Cutter, the Commanding Officers aboard the UNSC Spirit of Fire, the onboard professor and eye candy, Ellen Anders, and the clich\u00e9 slap-head Sergeant John Forge (now there's a power name). The Covenant's steel-clad Arbiter crops up along the way as the story progresses, told through high quality pre-rendered cinematics that feature some lovely lip synching and a chance to ogle the far-future landscape that Bungie and Ensemble have put together. The score is also suitably impressive and epic, playing off the classic Halo guitar riffs but transcribing them to a classical arrangement.  The Halo licence is a precious thing to Microsoft , and it's evident that it isn't going to let just anyone fool around with the fundamentals of the series. To that end, the setting, many units, locations and technology are pleasantly familiar; much of the iconic design work from Bungie has made the jump to RTS very nicely. At first, the most striking thing about the game is just how pretty it is for a strategy game. There's a level of polish applied to the engine that just isn't seen in many console RTSs, down to small, subtle animations, real-time lighting, environmental damage and the top-notch HUD system.  How you interface with the world and your troops is arguably the single most important element in Halo Wars. If it's too confusing to navigate menus at speed, or you need to memorise clunky button combinations and mapped controls, then you'll be at an immediate disadvantage. That's why Halo Wars is so refreshing \u2013 taking elements from games like the latest Command & Conquer console renditions and further refining them. The game uses a radial menu system that is also context sensitive \u2013 just highlight a unit or building and hit A; then, just use the left stick to point to the unit you want to create, the action to perform and so on. The radial menu also tracks things like material cost, tech level required and the creation time, as indicated by a green ring that gradually fills around the selected unit in production. There are no confusing icons or abbreviations \u2013 just images that are big and specific, well labelled in the centre of the radial menu. In fact, it's up there with the most streamlined menu systems in RTS console history.  The graphics are at times arresting, with stunning animation and, on levels that allow it, a draw distance and environmental details that paste jaws to floors.  This streamlining also extends to the way you play through the single and multiplayer game modes. Base construction is no longer a matter of finding a suitable location. Rather, most maps either come with the basic base preset on-location, ready for gradual expansion, or you can seek out pre-defined base locations dotted around the map. It's only a small change, but it takes a few moments of fiddly and somewhat unnecessary placement out of the equation. Constructing buildings is similarly streamlined; bases initially come with a handful of vacant expansion plots, but can be upgraded to a maximum of seven open locations on which to build. These are all automatically attached alongside the base headquarters, so there's no need to fiddle around with elevations or units in the way.  The limited construction sites actually add an interesting dimension to the strategy. Rather than having potentially unlimited energy creation or material refinement facilities (essentially, the raw components to create your Warthogs, Scorpions, Flamethrower troops and so on), you must juggle the speed of resource creation against how many different kinds of troops you want on the field. For example, a Wolverine counter-air unit costs three energy refineries and a vehicle depot if you want to create it. Along with a high resource cost, that means you need to use at least two building slots for creating refineries (and upgrade one, at additional cost), plus have at least two resource plants and a vehicle depot. Right there, that's five out of a total of seven of your potential building sites used. To get to that stage of production takes a little bit of forward planning \u2013 what kinds of troops you'll need, whether the enemies will be stronger or weaker against a certain vehicle and so on.   Again, most of that strategy comes with being a strategy game.  But the way in which it's presented is striking. Missions in the core single-player campaign have a more action-oriented focus to them \u2013 not just requiring an overwhelming Zerg-like rush of troops that you've gathered. Some missions, such as an early stage located on an idyllic vacation planet, have you defending transport carriers who are ferrying out civilians as the Covenant storm in. Others have you travelling from waypoint to waypoint, gathering up disparate units and protecting locations before clearing out a central threat in the area. All of this is directed through optional and essential mission objectives. If you want to go out of your way to maximise your score (and secure yourself a medal), then the best idea is to nail those objectives. If, however, you want to rush through the process and get to the cutscene payoff, then that's also that option.  If there's a downside to the single player experience, it's the later focus on The Flood, which take you through levels that tend towards less visually appealing and sometimes downright dark and muddy. When you factor in the Fog of War effect and a camera system that doesn't quite pull out far enough, things occasionally get too claustrophobic. The game's quick-jump provisions (taking you from unit and party to party) are mapped to the D-pad and you can quick-scroll by holding the left trigger , but the camera angle is a fickle beast and you'll wish you could tool around with it a little more.  The game's 15 core missions won't take you more than ten hours to get through, which is a shame. There's also a suspicious lack of Covenant single-player missions, which points towards an inevitable expansion by the newly formed Robot games (powered by ex-Ensemble employees) somewhere down the lines. However, the real long-term meat in Halo Wars rests firmly in multiplayer and co-op.   Playing as Covenant brings with it speed bonuses and unique craft and ground troops. Plus, purple is a wicked colour.  Strategy games like the venerable StarCraft and Command & Conquer series reached levels of fevered popularity in the late 90s from solid social gaming. Halo Wars makes similar provisions with a single-player co-operative campaign option via system link or over Xbox Live. You can hop into any level you've already unlocked or start from scratch, with the scale of the battles slightly adjusted to compensate for two players.  A few liberties have been taken with the Halo universe's available technology. Without spoiling the surprises, there are a dozen new vehicles and variants at your disposal that you likely haven't heard of before \u2013 but that radically spice up the roster. The AI is mostly very solid, ready to adapt to your large offensive numbers by seemingly spawning on-the-fly, and if you turn your back and leave your base undefended, you will suffer at their hands.  Multiplayer in its own right is a lot of fun, but it doesn't really hold any surprises. Up to six players can start off on maps that play off the visual cues of the single player game \u2013 lush greens and blues of Earth-like planets, ice fields, sour and muddy battlefields and blends of the three. The pattern follows the basic single-player formula \u2013 start with your preset plot of land, build a base, construct troops and so on. The kicker is that you can, StarCraft style, also capture unoccupied base locations (neutral territory, displayed as white on your mini-map) to expand your territory.   The combat in Halo Wars feels far more involving and energetic than your typical RTS. There's a lot going on, and despite your perspective, you feel involved.  Things dissolve predictably into whoever can build the biggest army the fastest, rather than any particular drawn out strategy \u2013 that's despite a really solid balancing between Human and Covenant factions, their units, in-field leaders (who have special powers and units at their disposal) and speeds. It's still a lot of fun, and skill-based friend-finding helps in this regard, but it's sad that there aren't more modes or co-operative multiplayer game styles. Again, like a Covenant single-player campaign and The Flood, we're guessing it's on the way as DLC. There are options for teams, AI opponents and all-out, every-player-for-themselves battles \u2013 a range to cater to all social dispositions, so we're not too disappointed.  It's also worth mentioning that the limited edition version comes with the Halo 3 Mythic Map pack, containing three new maps to expand Halo 3's multiplayer reach, as well as the nicely illustrated hardbound graphic novel, a unique in-game Wraith and an always thrilling iron-on badge and some art cards. All told, not bad for an extra AU$20 \u2013 but Halo 3 fans will get the most out of the value-added extras.  "

        "Content": "Noby Noby Boy takes a while to click, because enjoying it necessitates a complete recalibration of your gaming brain. You need to learn to stop searching for any kind of meaning or objective in its colourful madness, stop expecting it to reward you or compliment you or, really, pay any attention at all to your intrusion upon its perfectly self-contained little universe. Some will dismiss it as pointless, ridiculous and repetitive \u2013 and that's entirely fair, because it's all of those things. But if you let it, Noby Noby Boy can take you back to a time when you didn't care about objectives, and played merely for the enjoyment of playing itself.  \u306e\u3073\u306e\u3073 (nobinobi) in Japanese means, roughly, 'hang loose' \u2013 stretch out, procrastinate, be easy \u2013 and that's all the game's about. It's a giant whimsical timesink. You control BOY, who loosely resembles two stretchy globules of pink chewing gum connected by an ever-extending stripy scarf. Each stick controls one end of BOY \u2013 pull them in opposite directions and he starts stretching and stretching into a looping, barely controllable spaghetti mess. The game's gravity-light physics make it extremely difficult to stay still, though pressing the R2 and L2 buttons makes BOY grab hold of the ground to control his wild undulations.   The denizens of BOY's world are remarkably unperturbed by all this.  Tapping the same buttons makes BOY jump and float, flopping weirdly through the sky above the tiny level grids. You can consume and expel things, propelling you across the surreal and brightly-coloured landscape. The camera is controlled by holding down the L1 and R1 buttons in various combinations and tilting the controller \u2013 that probably sounds horribly cumbersome, but it's perfectly intuitive once you get used to it. Zoom all the way out and you can see the entire planet, with a cheerful sun-headed lion staring down at your antics and what looks like a giant BOY (GIRL, as it turns out, but more on that later) stretching out into the cosmos.  The game's levels are randomly generated. Scooch into the BOY House, select Move, and you'll have an entirely new area before you in just a few seconds. They're large, usually flat grids populated by animals, weird humanoids and a plethora of toybox objects and simple contraptions to knock over, eat, wind BOY around or thread him through. The world's inhabitants conduct themselves with a kind of unhinged spontaneity, deciding seemingly at random whether to chase BOY around in a car, jump on him for a ride or run from him in terror. Its animals range from the expected \u2013 cows, pigs, lions \u2013 to the more esoteric \u2013 tapirs, turtles, sphinxes \u2013 and the same can be said for all the other objects, too. Noby Noby throws up significantly different combinations of these strange artefacts almost every single time.   The stretchiest player in the WHOLE WORLD gets to be the king lion.  You can't die, or fail (or succeed, as it happens) \u2013 fall off the edge of the world and BOY splurges back out the chimney of the BOY House like Play-Doh spaghetti. Leave the controller alone and BOY starts wandering about this madness on his own, unperturbed by your absence. There's a built in screenshot feature and you can even capture videos by holding the Square button, uploading them straight to YouTube \u2013 like we have for you , right here \u2013 while the game happily carries on in the background.  After briefly introducing you to the controls, Noby Noby Boy just leaves you to make your own entertainment. What you do depends on what happens to be around you. You might find yourself in a bare forest populated entirely by ghosts and penguins, trying to wind yourself around the trees, or attempting to hook a floating doughnut cloud round one of them. There might be giant fruit with holes just big enough for a careful BOY to thread through that you obsessively use to turn yourself into a fruit necklace. You might decide to chase animals, or eat every single doughnut in the level, or persuade prancing Mariachis to ride you for a while. You'll even make exciting new discoveries every once in a while, such as the world-changing realisation that, by combining certain items, you can create flamingerinas or ghostguins.   You're never told to do any of these things; you just find yourself wanting to try them out, for some deep, unfathomable - yet probably extremely significant - reason. At first you feel as if you have frustratingly little control over what goes on but, after an hour or two, your mindset just adapts; you stop trying to make things happen, and just let things happen instead. A huge, stomping T-Rex might spontaneously decide to jump on your BOY and take a ride, or a flock of penguins might take it upon themselves to follow you around, squawking and spewing love hearts all over the landscape. Whatever happens though, it's usually enough to make you grin, if not collapse in delirious laughter.   This is exactly the kind of thing you could be doing instead of work.  Of course, it also might not - and that's really the main problem with Noby Noby Boy. There's no way of telling whether its thoroughly idiosyncratic charms will seep under your skin, plus there's no demo to help you to find out. For \u00a33.19 though, it's almost unequivocally worth a punt, especially as the version of Noby Noby Boy available right now is only a taste of the full experience. As the global PlayStation community tinkers in Noby's world, their cumulative stretching achievements are reported to GIRL, a giant version of BOY, who stretches off into space, toward new, unexplored planets. In a week or two, we'll reach the moon, and Mars beyond that, both of which will offer whole new playsets to bemuse and entertain. Noby Noby is an emergent experience, a fascinating example of subversive game design based around the cumulative achievements of a community of doodling players who, individually, are aiming to achieve nothing at all."

        "Content": "It's been ten months since Rockstar released Grand Theft Auto IV to rave reviews and blockbuster sales numbers. Tuesday brings a new chapter in GTA IV and a new step in the evolution of downloadable content. While expansion packs that include significant single-player and multiplayer additions are old practice on PC, robust post-market content is virtually unheard of on consoles. Without question The Lost & Damned, a $20 Xbox 360 exclusive, is the meatiest DLC to date. Not only do you get a significant single-player campaign, but L&D includes 54 new music tracks, 20 new vehicles, a half-dozen new weapons, new side missions, new TV shows and new multiplayer modes. That's quite a deal when you consider the three-hour experience provided by Fallout 3's recent Operation: Anchorage DLC cost ten bucks.  Just to make sure you know what is required to play L&D, you will need a copy of GTA IV in the drive, 1600 Microsoft Points and, of course, an Xbox 360 with an Xbox Live Gold Membership. After you've downloaded The Lost and Damned, boot up GTA IV. You should be launched directly into The Lost and Damned, but if not, select \"Game\" from the pause menu, choose \"New Game,\" and then choose the option to play The Lost and Damned.    The Lost and Damned takes place in Liberty City at the same time as Niko's tale from GTA IV. Though the two share characters and locations, they are treated as separate worlds. Keep this in mind, because anything good in L&D stays in L&D. Nothing transfers to Niko's adventures -- not the guns, the vehicles or the gameplay enhancements. This is significant, because almost everything Rockstar did with L&D makes the experience better, but none of it can be brought into GTA IV. That's a real shame, because the new campaign is the one significant shortcoming for this DLC. Even though the gameplay is better and the weapons are cooler, it doesn't really matter when you just don't give a damn about anything that's happening in the story.  This time around, you play as Johnny \"The Jew\" Klebitz, Vice President of the biker gang named The Lost. Johnny's been the de facto leader while the President of The Lost, Billy, has been in rehab. The story begins with Billy's release and resumption of duties as head of the gang. This naturally leads to a conflict as Billy looks to dive nose-first into the drug trade while Johnny wants The Lost to be smarter about how it handles its business.  The campaign, which can be beaten in 8-10 hours, is not one of Rockstar's stronger offerings. Johnny's not a likeable guy. He's a jerk, but not in the loveable way of someone like, well, me. He's just an ass as is everyone else in The Lost. And his plight comes off more as a common power struggle than any real moral conflict with Billy. By contrast Niko is a lot more than just a guy with a funny accent. Niko's journey is one of a lonely immigrant looking for companionship in a strange city. Though he does bad things, he never comes off as a bad guy. The same can't be said for Johnny. Though L&D's story begins with suggestions that Johnny is someone trying to turn his life around, the events that unfold show him to be as horrible a person as any other crook in Liberty City. GTA has always starred men doing bad things, but all of the other lead characters were likeable in some way.   Johnny and Niko's stories intersect both directly and indirectly throughout. When Johnny is partnered with Niko (which is linked to two GTA IV missions), he seems like an okay guy. Heck, even a stand-up guy. But there are other events, ones that help explain some things that occurred in GTA IV, where Johnny comes off as downright despicable. I won't spoil any of these story elements, but suffice to say that there's a specific mission towards the end of L&D that made me want to stop playing as Johnny altogether. If you loved Niko and his friends, then you may end up hating Johnny. It's not that what he does is out of bounds for a GTA character, but this is probably the first time Rockstar has had me do something bad to a character I cared about.  The story is not a success. Whether it's the weak subplot featuring Johnny's sometimes-girlfriend Ashley or the main plot focusing on Johnny and Billy's fractured friendship; nothing feels fully developed. To be fair, GTA IV could be compared to a miniseries, where L&D would be just an episode of a show. There's not as much time to invest in the characters or the story. But knowing that, the plot and some of the unnecessary missions could have been adjusted (or some of the characters cut out) to allow for a more focused and powerful narrative.   It doesn't help that, in an effort to separate GTA IV and The Lost and Damned visually, Rockstar added a grain filter. This filter occurs throughout and sullies what was a beautiful city. The grain is fine for cutscenes, but it makes Liberty City look drab when driving around town. And at night, in the rain, the grain makes things even darker. It can be tough to see what's going on. Sure, this filter can be turned off, but the default settings represent Rockstar's intent for this content.  The good news is that the story and grain filter are the only bad parts about The Lost and Damned. Everything else is top-notch.  Several crucial gameplay tweaks were made for L&D. The most notable is a major tweaking of the motorcycles. Anyone who played GTA IV can tell you that the bikes can be a bitch to handle and that it's easy to get unseated from your ride. Because L&D stars a biker, things needed to change. Every bike handles better in L&D and a healthy number have been added so that there's plenty of variety available. More importantly, it's incredibly difficult to be thrown from your bike now. You pretty much need to run head-on into a wall to get tossed. You can bounce off medians, smack against other cars and pretty much run roughshod over Liberty City with little concern for being unseated.   What many found an annoyance, is now a great asset. Not only are the bikes easy to handle and fun to ride, but they are so quick and nimble that the very thought of jacking a car in L&D makes me ill. In fact, I just threw up in Greg Miller's lunchbox. This, of course, has to be exactly what Rockstar wanted (for bikes to be more appealing than cars, not for me to chuck all over Miller's Lunchables). You are, after all, playing a biker. Being in a car is like being in a coffin.  As if the bikes weren't enough fun, there are some new weapons to enjoy, all of which are among the best Liberty City has to offer. There's an auto-pistol that makes playing 10 hours with just a handgun a viable option, the assault shotgun, which is just plain filthy, a sawn-off shotty for those who like to kill in close quarters, pipe bombs in case grenades are too military for your style, and a grenade launcher which allows for skill shots through windows and over cover. These weapons are powerful and plentiful in L&D. I've taken down cars in two or three shots with the assault shotgun and the grenade launcher might be the most fun weapon in GTA IV or L&D.  Johnny has one major advantage over Niko -- he's been in the city pretty much his entire life. He doesn't need to make friends. Sure, you can call up your biker buddies to shoot some pool or play air hockey, but you don't need to in order to attain their services. They're already your homeboys. Instead of measuring the strength of your friendships, The Lost and Damned measures the battle-readiness of your crew. Many of the missions in L&D have Johnny riding with his pals -- or having the ability to call in backup. Every member who survives gains experience, which increase their maximum health and their fighting prowess. If someone dies, they will be replaced by a newbie lacking the experience. This makes it beneficial to assist your friends in a firefight, as keeping them alive makes them stronger and thus makes the next shootout easier.   While I'm not a fan of the story, I did still have a damned good time with The Lost and Damned. And that's almost completely because of the improved bike mechanics and the sick new weapons. And, as you'd expect from a Rockstar offering, the presentation elements are top-notch. The voice acting is fantastic, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, and there's still the wonder that is Liberty City. It's pretty much the same place you explored as Niko, but it's still a fantastic creation.  Outside of the campaign, there's plenty to do. Getting 100% in L&D will take a good amount of time. There are 25 gang wars to be won across Liberty City, a dozen new bike races, new bike theft missions, several odd jobs to tackle for various miscreants, 50 seagulls to find and kill, a new comedy show to enjoy, some new mini-games to try once and then ignore, and full frontal nudity. Make that full frontal male nudity. That's right, Rockstar brings you Xbox 360's first downloadable dong.   As for multiplayer, it's back and just as strong as it was in GTA IV. Several modes from GTA IV carry over -- deathmatch, team deathmatch and free mode -- with others being altered to fit the ride or die lifestyle. The alterations were all made for the better and with access to better bikes and better weapons, L&D multiplayer is superior to that of GTA IV.  Here's the complete list of multiplayer modes: Deathmatch  Team Deathmatch  Races  Club Business  Lone Wolf Biker  Chopper vs. Chopper  Witness Protection  Own the City  Free Mode  Races is just as the name suggests. It's a checkpoint race on bikes, but with bats. There are specific buttons for swinging left or right. While it's just your typical race, there's something special about thwacking a guy off his bike as he attempts to cross the finish line. Club Business assigns a gang leader, who receives calls with various odd jobs around the city. It's fun, but not terribly different from Mafiya Work in GTA IV. The best of the modes modified from GTA IV is easily Witness Protection. This is similar to Cops 'n Crooks. Only now one team plays as NOOSE officers escorting a witness to one of the police stations in Liberty City and the other team plays as The Lost, trying to take the witness down. A gang of bikers rolling up on an armored van is incredibly cool and the fact that speed and handling are now on the side of the assassin's alters the strategies all around. Own the City is pretty much Turf War, and just as enjoyable.   Excuse me while I smack your face. As for new modes, Lone Wolf Biker pits one player against everyone else. Whoever kills the tagged biker becomes it and so on until time runs out. With a full house, this can be fun, but try Lone Wolf with just a handful of people and you'll find that the city is just a little too big and the person who's \"it\" too much of a coward for this to be exciting. The other complete new mode, and my personal favorite for all of L&D multiplayer, is Chopper vs. Chopper. This two-player mode places one person is in a helicopter, the other on a motorcycle. As the chopper flies through the city attempting to blow the rider to hell, the player on the bike races through checkpoints, attempting to stay alive as long as possible. It's a unique mode, quite different than just about anything you can find on Xbox Live.  Though many of the Lost & Damned modes are merely alterations on what is available in GTA IV, they are all still great games to play. Lone Wolf, Witness Protection, and Chopper vs. Chopper are certain to have the longest legs. "

        "Content": "Wii Sports is not just a videogame. It is a phenomenon. As such, dozens of imitators followed in its wake on the Wii, trying to replicate the magic of its accessible motion-controlled sports minigames. Few succeeded. That's why it is so cool to see a smart take on Wii Sports bowling on an entirely different platform: iPhone. I-play Bowling 3D uses the iPhone accelerometer to translate the arm motion of rolling a bowling ball. It's not a tricky system. It works. Within seven tries, I rolled my first strike.  I-play Bowling 3D is a port of a mobile game. The mobile edition used the handset's camera to mimic motion controls. That version worked exceptionally well, too. (In fact, I-play Bowling for mobile won the Best Sports Game in the Wireless category of our 2008 Game of the Year awards.) The extra screen real estate makes the iPhone edition the superior offering, though. With a larger display, you have an easier time watching the trajectory of your ball which helps with course correction, activated by tilting the iPhone left or right. A little nudge at just the right time is all it takes to turn a nasty split into a strike.   Strike! To roll the ball in I-play Bowling, you first slide your finger across the lane to determine your starting position. Then, you slide an arrow to select the angle of your throw. Once you lift your finger from the screen, you're ready to roll. Just draw your device back and then arc it forward like rolling a real bowling ball. You need to keep the forward motion as straight as possible to get a good roll or else you'll hook it right into the gutter. Use the practice mode to get the hang of the controls before jumping into a tournament.  You do not need to make giant gestures. I-play Bowling 3D is a little more subtle than real bowling, so if you have little space to move, that's cool. Just moving the device about a foot or so back and then pushing it forward is enough to register the roll. Despite the fact you are making smaller movements, this still feels much like actual bowling -- certainly more than just swiping your finger up the screen.  I-play Bowling 3D includes a pretty limited avatar system that lets you craft a bowler out of a handful of face parts and hairstyles. The art for the avatars is not going to wow everybody, but it has its own sense of style. After creating a bowler, you can enter a series of tournaments and unlock awards, trophies, and secret bowling balls. The computer opponents are fair at first, but admittedly become merciless by the time you reach the gold tournament. They can be beaten, but you better bring your A-game.  There is also a two-player mode where you hand off your device. Unlike many iPhone games with multiplayer modes, this is an actual two-player mode you will play because it moves briskly (you can get through ten frames in about ten minutes) and it encourages social gaming, like Wii Sports bowling.   I-play Bowling 3D was reviewed with version 1.0.0.",

        "Content": "thatgamecompany has depicted something that I never once imagined: what would a flower's dream look like if we could see it? Flower , a PS3 downloadable that comes as a spiritual successor to flOw, is one of the most beautiful games that I've ever played. Not just because the visuals are entirely breathtaking, but also because the experience of playing it offers more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game I've tried in years.  Before you read on, keep in mind that Flower isn't quite for everyone. There will be those that experiment with it but won't see the point, as it strays so far from the traditional spectrum of gameplay systems, but it's truly worth playing.  Flower is a poem, where you as the player participate in the dreams of flowers confined to the ever-changing landscape of a colorless city. Each dream, or stage, revolves around a different theme and gameplay objective, but your method of control remains the same: tilt the controller to direct a series of flower petals through beautiful environments. Press any button to stir up a wind that will coax them along. As you begin with one flower petal, you'll soon touch other flowers and gather more petals, generally influencing the environment in a way that pleases the dreamer. This setup works amazingly well to create varying tasks for you to enjoy.   Your ethereal playground.  As odd as it sounds, thatgamecompany has created one of the most elegantly crafted gaming experiences of all time, where learning only takes a moment -- if it doesn't already come naturally. I've never felt motion controls work so seamlessly before, but Flower is a testament to how effective the scheme can be when used properly. Even turning the controller upside down will cause the petals to blow in a loop or travel towards the camera. Furthermore, the fact that the game only requires one button (any button on the controller) makes it totally approachable. I found the right analog stick to be my favorite method of controlling the wind, as applying a light amount of pressure caused a weaker breeze and subsequently allowed for more precise control.  In truth, that's really all there is to Flower from a gameplay perspective, but the experience is much more fulfilling than you could understand just from reading about it. Watching the petals join together in a subtle blend of light and musical notes while thousands of blades of grass billow back to life stirred deeply-rooted emotions in me. The majesty of it all stems from the fact that Flower tells you so much by saying so little -- as if a Zen poem had been lovingly shaped into a videogame. This is the sort of experience that anyone can enjoy with the right attitude. There is no death or failure. You simply complete the objectives and solve organic puzzles in your own time while basking in the euphoria of the game's visuals and music.  But for gamers more interested in traditional challenges, there are secrets to be found in each stage, as well as extremely clever Trophies that tie in brilliantly with the game's overarching philosophy. Although the entire game can be \"completed\" in under an hour and a half, there is an impressive amount of replay value that comes just from playing in the sweeping fields. For example, one dream allows you to change your petals to one of three different colors. Skirting across the grass in this state will paint the grass that color, giving you the freedom to color an entire valley as you see fit. This is entirely optional and unobtrusive in its design, but adds a layer of gameplay onto the stage that enhances the richness of the experience.   It's just the nature of life.  Although I admit that I would have liked to see even more in Flower, I am completely comfortable with the game's length. The reward you receive emotionally is easily worth the ten dollar price tag. Flower is also the type of game that you can come back to just for the joy of playing it again. It's so streamlined and elegant that I'm even content to let it sit idly on my PS3, as it will quietly switch to stunning landscape shots of the current stage."

        "Content": "Killzone 2 was always designed to be a system seller. It was the title that Sony banked on way back in 2005 during that infamous 'target-render' trailer announcement, providing a tantalising glimpse of what might be, or at very least, what developer Guerrilla Games were aiming for. Years later, in the face of expectations both positive and negative, Killzone 2 has achieved its ambitious visual fidelity and immersive, yet cinematic presentation. But is it a shooter worth your time? That's the US$599 question that a lot of early adopters are probably clawing to get answered.  We'll save you some time, then.  Yes. Definitely , yes. This is as solid a shooter as PlayStation fans and hardcore early-adopters have been hoping for, with scope, features and all-round excellent production values for a game that came from decidedly iffy PS2 roots. It does have a few concessions, but long review short \u2013 it's going to make your PS3 sweat as much as your grimy gaming palms and your moon-tan brow. However, it's a bit of a 'conditional-yes' because Killzone 2 stood on the shoulders of giants to get there, taking several transparent cues to market leaders and genre stand-outs to form its gameplay, story, characters, twists and critically, its attitude.    The narrative in Killzone 2 picks up immediately after the events of Killzone: Liberation on PSP \u2013 though, no knowledge of either the first Killzone or its PSP sequel is necessary. The Helghast threat, led by Scolar Visari (megalomaniacal and despotic Autarch of the Helghan peoples) has gotten its hands on Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA \u2013 they're the good guys) nukes and is out to get the all-important activation codes. ISA Special Forces group 'Alpha Squad', led by Tomas 'Sev' Sevchenko is sent to run interference \u2013 essentially to thwart Visari and his military commander Radec's attempts to get the activation codes while simultaneously contributing to the war effort and taking out the Helghan army forces once and for all. Of course, things are never quite that simple in practice.  A stunningly edited opening movie sets the scene: swarms of red-eyed future-Nazis fighting against a thinly veiled American armed forces battalion on the surface of the planet Helghan in a conflict that will eventually take you through environments that range from your typical glowing industrial complexes and energy refineries through to more interesting set-piece levels like a massive locomotive thundering along and across the surface of a dust-bitten and windswept shanty village. It's not a revolution in creative locations or narrative framework, but developer Guerrilla Games manages to capture the feel of a consistent, ongoing epic struggle with one of the most impressive graphical engines on the PS3 or any platform to date.  Such is the extreme level of artistry and clever programming at work in Killzone 2 that there are only two fair comparisons we can make, at least visually: Gears of War 2 and Crysis. Both stand as two of the finest looking games out there and Killzone 2 now confidently snuggles up alongside these. The world of Helghan is rendered magnificently; each of the game's five locations (spread across ten missions) has a distinct colour scheme and physical characteristic. The use of Sony's Deferred Renderer Engine, with its inherent pixel shading techniques, has taken some of the strain off the processor, allowing for some incredible lighting effects and textural detail.   It's no exaggeration that this is one of the best looking games of all time.  Levels are littered with light sources that cast tones of deep blues and reds through to arresting whites that create stark silhouettes as enemies pass in front of them. The air is often littered with debris; little particles catching the wind and blowing through the landscape. Later levels, like the abandoned Sujeva Village, cast the hot afternoon sun on its loose and dusty soil, which sweeps across the land. As Alpha Squad tramples across its surface, clouds of dust are raised and blown into the air. Explosions leave inky black clouds of smoke in their wake, grenades blow panels off walls and take chunks out of pillars and barriers, sending rubble spilling in all directions and sparks flying as machinery is caught in the blast radius. All the while, bullets and grenades zip past as the earth shakes from a nearby explosion and the DualShock 3's rumble pulls you back into reality, just in time to duck for cover as an RPG whizzes past your head, exploding a little too close to you, plastering the edges of the screen with blood, tinting your vision and deafening you momentarily.  Killzone 2 is one of the finest, most visually unified games ever made. Period. It's a rush to just sit back and watch, almost to the point of distraction. It uses colour and lighting to evocative effect, while impressing on a technical level as much as an artistic one. The framerate is locked at 30 frames per second and we never encountered any slowdown. Incredible. While many games can claim to emulate a dystopian far-future in the traditions of something like Gears of War, Killzone 2 really tries hard to nail its own unique visual stamp and it succeeds. It has no permanent HUD \u2013 just an ammunition counter in the lower right that fades in when firing your gun and fades out when you're not. There is no radar either, which is bold and laudable. It's refreshing to play a game that really forces you to look before you leap, rather than relying on your radar to tell you the immediate threat.   From early on, we were tempted by the idea of an immersive sense of physical presence in the first person perspective \u2013 keeping things cinematic while making your character into someone more than a disembodied arm and a gun. Mirror's Edge ultimately beat Killzone 2 to the punch, but Killzone responds with a far more action-oriented application of kinetic movement, like inertia and gravity, affecting your character's body. Simply put, Killzone 2 makes you feel like you have to take your body's dimensions and weight into consideration when you're sprinting, jumping over obstacles and, most of all, when using the much touted cover system.  By holding down L2 by any edge of about waist height, you'll automatically cling to the edge until you let go, allowing you to tilt the left stick away from the surface and fire off a few rounds, or zoom in with a click of R3. This is about as close as Killzone 2 comes to innovating within the FPS space, and the cover system works very well. There were only a handful of times when we couldn't get Sev to duck down next to the surface we wanted him to \u2013 generally next to a barrel or a crate that was slightly off-centre or tilted. Still, vaulting over the box and swinging out from cover point to open space feels excellent \u2013 heavy in a good way, like you're actually shifting human mass. The animations of your squad mates are equally impressive, displaying smooth transitions from running to ducking and sliding in for cover, or scrambling over a wall, through a gap and out the other side.   The combat leans towards realism, rather than traditionally over-the-top sci fi thrills.  The raw shooting mechanics also tend towards realism. The feel of the game actually approaches a title like Call of Duty 4, more than Insomniac's Resistance 2. The weapons aren't over-the-top (with the exception of a couple beefier ones that we'll discuss later), shifting to fine aiming mode by clicking R3 shifts the weapon to the centre of the screen and lines the sights up with your eyes, which is also now standard in the genre. In fact, much of Killzone 2 is just that \u2013 standard for the genre. The setting, while stunning to behold, isn't as foreign as a game like Halo 3, where you're dealing with alien races and technology. Vehicles, buildings and equipment, while vaguely futuristic, still cater to strictly human races and there's a subsequent familiarity to most of the locations that you'll encounter.  However, just when you think that Killzone 2 has eschewed its far-future science fiction roots completely however, Guerrilla Games throws a curve ball or two, keeping things interesting. Late in the game, you'll take control of a bipedial mech of all things; a giant, missile-totting robotic power suit that stomps across the landscape, turning enemies into strawberry jelly.  It comes out of left field, but its presence adds some much needed variety to proceedings. Does the enemy have one? Do you ever see or hear about it again before or after this? No. But it's a scientifically irrefutable fact that piloting mechs is fun and so is blowing up a sole grunt with a well-placed rocket upside their head, so combining the two makes for great gameplay. True.  Missions aren't particularly complex, which is disappointing. On the whole, it's a case of blowing up a target point with explosives (the Sixaxis motion sensing works just fine when rotating from left to right, which is a relief) or simply navigating from point to point and wiping out the Helghast threat in each area as you encounter it. In some ways, this feels like a missed opportunity; a few side objectives (outside of finding 'intel' briefcases or shooting Helghast symbols hidden in levels) or hidden areas would've greatly improved replayability. Likewise, some decision-making or consequences for your choices also might have spiced things up a little bit. Props to the team for the excellent direction marker, activated by pressing up on the D-pad. The marker directs you through the level and to your next objective without cluttering the HUD, and it never seems to wig out.   Mission objectives aren't particularly inventive or complex - mostly, you'll just be shooting a lot of these guys.  Killzone 2 is at its best when its blending shooter styles; switching between lone-gunman moments of corridor crawling with nary but the light of your shotgun to keep you company, through to sections of squad-based clearing all the way to full-blown conflicts that involve dozens of enemies and allies all facing off from different vantage points. One minute you're pressing back a wave of Assault Troopers up some stairs at the base of a tower and the next you're helming an anti-aircraft turret, blasting the Helghan air force to smithereens. It's all pretty fun, and the pace is almost unrelenting. Your only downtime is during auto-save moment or exposition sequences and cutscenes.  If you're looking to break away from the single player experience, Killzone 2 has two other multiplayer-focused modes on offer. The first is Warzone, for up to 32 players (or a mix of players and bots). This is the multiplayer hub in Killzone 2, allowing you to access the game selection screen, character customisation screen, your personal stats and more. After tailoring your settings and hosting or joining a game, you're able to choose your class from one of seven options (progressively unlocked): Assault, Engineer, Medic, Scout, Infantry, Tactician and Saboteur. Each has its own weapons and skills, though, the more you play the more your stats improve and the more skills you develop, regardless of class. There are human and Helghan variants of each class too, so nobody misses out. From what we played, the classes seem balanced \u2013 though, we question if anyone but purists will opt for the more tactical classes such as Medics and Tacticians.   Outside of creating your own custom game styles, the real beauty of Killzone 2's multiplayer rests with its single-minded dedication to making you work as a team. Objectives shift on the fly, switching between one of five different game types as you're playing. In practice, you get a couple of minutes to try and capture a post, for instance, before either succeeding or failing and then moving on to do something different. It's a seamless experience that ensures that people who actually try to complete the objectives are rewarded more than griefers who are just there to cause trouble or boost their kill count. To emphasise team play, you can also form into squads of four and from there into a squad of eight, so if you get some friends online together, the potential to create clans is obvious. Killzone 2 caters for this too, with an in-built clan creation tool that is also linked to the game's website.  We played several games hosted in Europe over a standard ADSL2+ connection and experienced little to no lag, which is excellent. There were also options to limit your game selections to your local region, which should please Aussies frustrated with a lack of local sorting in other multiplayer games. Sadly, we're not going to see vehicles in multiplayer from day one; there's a promise of a content patch coming, though, that should add these \u2013 as well as two-player co-op \u2013 before too long. Let's hope that's not just a hollow promise.   The multiplayer pre-game menu allows you to customise a host of features and options.  The second mode that Killzone 2 offers is much like multiplayer, but aimed at quick, offline skirmishes \u2013 hence, Skirmish Mode. This pits you against up to 15 other bots of customisable difficulty in the same maps and with the same objectives as Warfare. Consider it a great way to bone up on your skills and to learn the maps, or a cool alternative if you have no mates and no online connection. Frankly, it's nice to see bots back in games again \u2013 let's hope other developers share Guerrilla Games' view.  It's really important at this stage in the review to call out a few things that hold Killzone 2 back from being a rapturous gameplay delight, and therefore a near-perfect experience.  PlayStation fanboys out there: please brace yourself, because this is going to hurt a little bit. Killzone 2 never comes as close to being as innovative as it is striking to look at. There are some incredible water cooler moments in there \u2013 don't get us wrong - but the final level of the game deflates the experience somewhat and really underlines how little the game pushes the boundaries of shooters.  After nine fairly solid stages that, at worst, toe the FPS line to a tee, the tenth and final stage builds and builds and builds ... only to soil itself at the finish line like an over-exhausted marathon runner. Yes, you get across the line \u2013 but there isn't a whole lot of dignity or fanfare when you do.  We can't spoil this for you [ you'd publicly disembowel me, and I'd deserve it --Patch] but the end foe is cheap, nasty and boring. There. We said it. Considering how far you come from the start of the game and what you go through to get to that point, the last enemy you encounter is a massive disappointment. This foe's techniques revolve around teleportation and one-hit-kills that will try your patience and make you hope, pray, beg for something more or someone else at tousle with.  You won't get it.  What you do get is a four minute cutscene comprising prosaic, quip-filled silliness and a baffling and ambiguous cliffhanger ending (or is it?).  (It is.)   Killzone 2 flirts with moments of one-man-army tension and all-out battlefield mayhem. The pace, however, rarely relents.  Actually, the silly dialogue and Hollywood-lite posturing leads us to the next point. The characters, their personalities and reactions in given situations, sit dangerously close to the archetypal Gears of War squad members. You have your 'Cole Train' \u2013 in Killzone 2, he's Rico, an abrasive African American who clearly learned his interpersonal skills in the mean streets of future-South Central; you have your Marcus Fenix \u2013 in his place, you have Sev, the leader of Killzone 2's Alpha Squad, sporting a shaved of head and a heart full of secret turmoil. Of course, calling out Killzone 2 on formulaic characters is like saying 'that porn star's boobs look fake' - It comes with the territory and it's all part and parcel of the 'ooh-rah' , guts-and-glory, 'do it for America' attitude that many of these games share. It's just that Killzone 2 is the latest of these, and more importantly, it really plays too closely to Gears' formula \u2013 almost like a narrative equation at times. You'll pick who dies, how people respond accordingly and even the big plot twist well before it happens. If you don't give two shakes about stories in your shooters, then feel free to disregard this whole point. But for everyone else, this isn't a particularly compelling story full of characters that you connect with on any deeper level, and that ultimately impacts the cinematic quality of the storytelling.    When you strip back the incredible graphics and in-your-face production values, there's very little that pushes Killzone 2 above games like Gears of War 2, Resistance 2, Halo 3 or Crysis in terms of gameplay. The cover system is handy, but frequently, using cover becomes almost a moot point; a big gun and a whole lot of patience become your best friend. Besides, cover systems are hardly unique these days \u2013 even in first-person shooters.  Is Killzone iconic, then? Well, the enemies certainly are from a design standpoint \u2013 except, when you realise that there are only a handful of ground troop types, a token 'tank' class and a few airborne enemies that could've been pulled from any of the shooters mentioned above. The weapons aren't remarkable, outside of the Electro-gun, which is one of the sole sci-fi-esque weapons in the game. You're really only looking at your usual line-up of SMGs, rifles, shotguns, explosives and distance weapons \u2013 so nothing really sets Killzone apart here too. Well, is it epic in length? At nine and half hours on our first play through on standard difficulty and moderately thorough exploration, we'd have to go with no .    So what's left, after this chunk of reality-checking negativity?  That's the interesting part. Killzone 2, despite coming from dubious heritage, manages to do everything it tries its hand at really well . It's mostly such a solid experience almost all the way through that it almost doesn't matter that it's just not as clever or ground-breaking as Guerrilla Games (or Sony's marketing arm, more critically) thinks it is. And that's also not to say that it's anything less than excellent \u2013 it is, assuredly. But it's not the second coming of pixel-Jesus.  You will have a hell of a lot of fun shooting things, blowing the environment apart, piloting mechs, struggling your way along an exposed transport train, setting explosives with the Sixaxis, raiding facilities and gaping at lens flares everywhere you look. The inclusion of thoughtful multiplayer modes and a host of little details and thoughtful inclusions also picks up a certain amount of slack here too \u2013 the dynamically shifting gameplay styles during  Warzone mode stand up there with the most interesting approach to multiplayer shooting since Resistance 2's 64 player structured frag-fest.

        "Content": "Four years ago Blizzard launched World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online RPG that abruptly snatched the spotlight from former genre heavyweight, Sony Online's EverQuest, and went on to enjoy a degree of success few could have predicted. With 11 million subscribers worldwide, the cultural impact of Blizzard's creation is difficult to accurately measure. It's spawned its own lexicon, countless Internet memes, appeared as the focus of an episode of South Park, and has dominated industry discussion about online games since its release.  Games like this like this aren't one-shot, linear run-throughs or exercises in melding gameplay with abstract artistic themes; they're  services. You pay a subscription fee and in return you get stable servers to play on, constant bug fixes, updates to game systems, added content, and customer support lines.  It's a much different experience from other media, such as movies or books, particularly when trying to assess some kind of worth. You don't fault a movie for crashing, for instance, you fault the projector. A paragraph in a novel will never glitch out, requiring you to close and reopen the pages to reset it. A massively multiplayer online game has so many more moving pieces and potential complications that having a company like Blizzard working behind the scenes should inspire confidence. It's got the quality assurance staff and support to ensure its products are remarkably polished, perform well, and actually work across a range of desktops and laptops with wildly varying hardware configurations. Also, the fact that there's such a large player base means this virtual world isn't getting shut down anytime soon, a danger with this type of game as most recently demonstrated with NCsoft and Tabula Rasa.   Video Review - Watch or download the video here (HD available).  Wrath of the Lich King is the second expansion to Blizzard's game, something the player base has already snatched up in great quantities. This kind of release schedule, with an expansion roughly every two years, differs from what Sony Online did with EverQuest, a game that just received its 15th expansion in just about 10 years. What you get with a Blizzard expansion is an incredible amount of content, some of the more prominent features being a new level cap, a new continent, the first added player class since the game's launch, and a general assurance it's all going to work correctly.  Simply having plenty of content and stability isn't enough to make the game worthy of your dollar however. You could, for instance, have a magazine subscription where the product is always on time, in good condition, and is full of pictures and text, but in the end it's still just another issue of Sawdust Quarterly. As most gamers out there know already, World of Warcraft is a remarkable product. From the entertaining, strongly defined classes with wildly diverse functionality and generally solid feel and timing of activating skills, to a gigantic, beautiful open world and myriad ways to spend your time leveling up professions, coordinating large-scale attacks against powerful dungeon bosses, or engaging in player versus player battles ensures you'll find something to like.  While the previous expansion, The Burning Crusade, offered quite a bit for new WoW players back in January 2007 with two new playable races and accompanying level 1 \u2013 20 starting zones, Wrath of the Lich King is geared more for high level players. The level cap has been bumped up to 80, and the new continent of Northrend isn't accessible until you've got a higher level character, so if you're new you'll need to move through the original release content as well as territory from the first expansion, both of which are required to play Lich King. That being said, Blizzard made the leveling process up to 70 much more rapid through patches released before The Lich King's arrival, so those who activate now won't spend nearly as much time in the original release territory or Outland from The Burning Crusade as those who dove in when the content was still new.   You'll be seeing a lot of this guy. With the majority of the player base at or very much on their way to the level 80 cap at this point, any green players won't really experience the full degree of the community and social strengths of the game until later on. Even longtime players will have to retread some old content since the new class, the Death Knight, starts at level 55.  Provided you've got a high enough level character you can roll one of these demonic melee fighters as Horde or Alliance and experience right away one of the expansion's major strengths; a stronger narrative cohesion. Unlike the other classes, Death Knights get their very own introductory quest lines that have you working temporarily for Arthas, also known as the Lich King. In all it's about 49 quests that start out with your character battling against the forces of light, killing citizens, infiltrating operations, assaulting strongholds, and flying frost wyrms over battlefields to reign death on those below. Through a few in-game, voiced character interactions alter you'll witness some dramatic events that provide a nice narrative context for the class within Blizzard's alternately self-serious and flippant fictional world.  After the introductory sequence you take a bit of a detour though Outland as you'll need to level up to the requirement for entry into Northrend before rejoining the story of Arthas. At least Blizzard didn't make players restart at level 1. While it's difficult to say at this point what kind of role Death Knights will carve out in raiding groups and what kind of PvP strategies will be developed, they're certainly an entertaining class to play. Compared with the other nine alternatives in World of Warcraft, Death Knights have a distinct rhythm to their play styles, a result of two unique resource systems used to pull off moves.  Death Knights start off fights by consuming different types of runes to activate skills, all of which have an accompanying cooldown sequence. Using these skills also builds runic power that makes available other skills, meaning the flow of fights with Death Knights alternates between managing rune cooldowns to trigger abilities and counterbalancing that with those that consume runic power.   Talent trees of course strengthen different aspects of the class. Depending on how you've allocated your points you can be more effective at generating and maintaining runic power, make yourself more resilient in battle, dramatically boost your damage output and unlock a number of interesting skills. The Death Knight can, for instance, briefly come back to life as a ghoul after being killed, project a stationary anti-magic zone to dampen incoming magical damage, call down a gargoyle to inflict damage on foes, blow up corpses like Diablo II's Necromancer, and even summon a ghoul companion. Considering the class wears plate armor it's certainly a force to be reckoned with, and is particularly noticeable in PvP because of its death grip ability, which yanks targets from a distance to the death knight. It's been a long wait for a new class to toy around with, and what Blizzard has delivered provides players with a fresh set of distinct, entertaining skills to put to usewhile playing solo and grouped.  One criticism that tends to get leveled at MMOs like WoW is that there's no strong central narrative. Something like BioWare's Mass Effect has a powerful story and characters, the endless nature of the MMO and the need for the developer to keep players engaged so they'll keep that subscription active means there can't really be a true termination, even if there are climactic events, though games like Turbine's Lord of the Rings Online try to address that. That being said, Blizzard has built in much more narrative across the zones of Northrend, anchored by frequent appearances by Arthas, which makes the leveling process a more interesting endeavor.   A floating quest hub in Icecrown, an example of more interesting zone designs. Like in the Death Knight opening sequences, players will get plenty of opportunity to interact with the Scourge's heavily armored leader. He tends to show up all over the place, after seemingly mundane quests in the Howling Fjord to the finale of a dungeon run through Drak'Tharon Keep on the borders of Grizzly Hills and Zul'Drak. He'll spout sinister lines with a Dr. Claw-like cadence and whether you take him seriously or smirk at his overwrought malevolence, you can't help but pay attention when he raises his sword, Frostmourne, to single out a victim or emphasize a point. One of the more involved questlines in a zone called Dragonblight fleshes out more of Arthas' history, his transformation from noble prince to embodiment of evil, and culminates in a lengthy cut-scene surrounding the Wrath Gate (Black Gate?) that gives players a better sense of what's going on in the world at large, and with a follow-up questline that spans the old world and provides a nice connection between the new and existing content.  What's perhaps more effective for narrative delivery is how Blizzard's implemented localized changes in the game world depending on your actions. This can be as subtle as a bed of flowers popping up around an NPC after you turn in a quest, to more large scale alternations. After the Wrath Gate event, for instance, the landscape in front of the entrance is encircled by fire and screaming citizens run every which way and it stays that way afterward. In the Death Knight opening scenario, you'll travel back and forth between the land and a floating necropolis, and between each journey to and fro there'll be no load times yet the landscape below will shift from idyllic human town to a roaring battlefield over which frost wyrms soar. These types of transitions, though sometimes subtle, really work to enhance the notion that you're affecting the game world in a meaningful way. Coupled with the in-game cut scenes and you've got a World of Warcraft with far more narrative direction that has been previously seen.   In Northrend you'll find much more varied quests structures. Yet you've still got to drop in the caveat that it's a good story\u2026for an MMO. It's something that those ensconced in Azeroth will absolutely adore, but won't win over those who put the game to the side years ago or those who never took any interest in the genre in the first place.  Another step forward for Blizzard is their overall zone design. Northrend not only looks far more appealing than any of the old world content but also contains a wider variety of quests. It's an important development as many tend to complain about how getting quests to kill X number of mobs, pick Y bits of random crap off the ground, or collect Z collectibles off of corpses can make you want to tear your hair out, and rightfully so. Those types of quests are boring, and in Wrath of the Lich King Blizzard has not only strengthened storytelling, but it's greatly improved the quest structures.  You'll still spend time killing and collecting but quest chains are mixed up with vehicle missions, like running dragon battle daily quests at Wyrmrest Temple where you blast fireballs at other winged reptiles. There's sequences where you swoop around battlefields to snatch up survivors as well as numerous instances where you put on disguises to infiltrate enemy installations and quest for monsters which all work to alleviate the drooling stupor you might fall into after doing the same type of quest for hours on end. Some of these sequences don't work all that well though, like a giant-riding section in Zul'Drak and a defense sequence on a mountainside in Icecrown, but the glitches hardly affect the overall experience.  The zone designs contribute to the sense of variety as well through complex geographic layouts like the sprawling canyons of the Howling Fjord to the jungles of Sholazar Basin. The highest level zones of Storm Peaks and Icecrown are even more impressive, as they cater to players with flying mounts. In Icecrown, for instance, a quest hub floats over the zone in the form of a battleship. Not only does it make for an interesting setup as you fly up to receive tasks and can explore the innards of the ship, but builds on the notion that this is an epic conflict and allows for some gorgeous vistas as you fly out over the railing and behold the frozen wastes and Tolkien-esque black barbs of Icecrown Citadel and its snaking gates.   Then there's of course the instanced dungeons in which players battle tougher content but are rewarded with better items for their character. From the starting 5-man endeavors into The Nexus and Utgarde Keep to higher level instances like Gundrak, Wrath of the Lich King's basic dungeons are all fairly accessible and brief, meaning there aren't droves of mobs to battle through to get to the loot yielding bosses. We were moving through with pick-up groups in roughly 45 minutes, and that was without anyone having previous knowledge of the layout or boss attack patterns. The more involved raid dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King can be entered in either 10 or 25 man groups, yet again lowering the bar for players who may be intimidated by the more organized, team-oriented styles of play.  Beating on AI controlled bosses and leveling your character isn't the only option in World of Warcraft; there's also quite a bit of player versus player combat to be had. On open PvP servers you can slap around anyone of the opposing faction, but Blizzard has gradually added a number of more ordered systems to its game over the years, something expanded upon in Wrath of the Lich King. Wintergrasp, a zone dedicated entirely to PvP, lies buried near Northrend's center. It's an attempt by Blizzard to give more structure to larger scale conflicts, as players can enter the zone and after a timer counts down attempt to assault or defend a fortress. It's not something that's going to elevate the game's open PvP element to the level of Mythic Entertainment's Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, but it's still a nice change of pace from leveling or bashing bosses since, in addition to engaging in large-scale team battles, you can commandeer siege equipment armed with rams and destructive projectiles to break apart pieces of the stronghold, adding another element to the PvP gameplay.   Much of the same gameplay you're used to, which is far from a bad thing. The culture surrounding this new zone hasn't really matured at this point, though there's certainly potential. Something that's a little more measurable is the Strand of the Ancients battleground arena, a new type of set player limit see-saw battle where teams take sides storming a series of gates with siege equipment. It fits in with the general philosophy of the expansion pack where Blizzard takes what their player base enjoys and adds to it, in this case socketing another cog in the overall PvP machinery.  Plenty of smaller scale changes have been implemented on top of this, not the least of which is another new profession, Inscription, that among its many functions allows players to power up existing skills. Other profession systems have been adjusted as well. With Enchanting, one of our main character's professions, it's possible toenchant rings, though only your own. An achievement system has also been built into the game, evidence that Blizzard took a note from systems whirring in something like Microsoft's Xbox 360, where simply by virtue of adding in a goal, let's say kill a number of turkeys within a time limit, the company can keep its player base busy sometimes even without a reward beyond a higher achievement point total.  Not to deny the player base a fancy new hangout, Wrath of the Lich King includes a new capital city. Called Dalaran, the metropolis floats over the sparkling forests of Crystalsong on Icecrown's border, and comes with portals to other major cities, access to battlegrounds and Wintergrasp, and even its own instance, the Violet Hold, where groups fend off wave after wave of powerful enemies and bosses.  Dalaran, like the rest of the zones, is quite pretty thanks to graphical effects recently added into the game including real-time shadows and more detailed models. Pairing those upgrades with the more interesting zone designs and a return to more realistic settings, a refreshing change after the alien zones in Outland, and you've got a game that still manages to impress with scenes of occasional beauty. And of course you get character animations practically unparalleled in the genre, and a diverse range of spell and ability effects that easily allow players to identify another's class as soon as something's cast. Many of Warcraft's sounds will be familiar to players, but the music and effects are still of the highest quality. While running around Northrend you'll be treated to a score that works to enhance the overall feeling of the zones, and it's always great to listen to the Lich King's spiteful verbal barbs.  Even after four years, the game's visuals manage to impress. "

        "Content": "Nintendo's attempts to lure in new gamers have seen mixed results, but Personal Trainer: Cooking is a slam dunk for anyone who needs a little help around the kitchen.  We all gotta eat, right?  This is the perfect opportunity for us gamers to pass on another frozen pizza and get our hands dirty making our own darn food.  Personal Trainer: Cooking isn't the first culinary coach for the DS -- Jamie Oliver's game arrived a few weeks ago.  But Nintendo's effort goes far beyond what Jamie cooked up, acting as a truly interactive cookbook with lots of audio tips, video tutorials, and a friendly interface.  I should point out this isn't a game.  There aren't any touch screen mini-games to be played and you aren't scored on the meals you prepare.  Rather, this is a modern cookbook that goes much further with its advice than your common bound text.  Basically, the book is dead and nobody knows how to read anymore, anyway.  You're probably just staring at this review, trying to make sense of all the funny characters, right?  Anyway, the meat of Cooking is the 245 recipes from all sorts of ethnicities and their step-by-step tutorials.  The menu can be sorted in several useful ways by country of origin, course, ingredients, calories, prep time, and more.  A calendar keeps track of your adventures in food, stamping dates you used the software and what dish was prepared.  Maneuvering around the interface with your stylus is a breeze.   Speak and your Personal Trainer will obey. But of course, once you get cooking you're liable to get your hands begrimed and you don't want to dirty your DS.  That's why Nintendo included the option to move through recipes with your voice.  Using the commands \"last step,\" \"repeat,\" and \"continue,\" the DS microphone will hear and obey.  The method doesn't work perfectly and you may have to repeat yourself a few times, but it's not quite as bad as the microphone tests in Brain Age (\"Yellow.  Y-e-l-l-o-w.  YELLOW!!\").  Thanks to thorough voice work you don't have to keep your eyes on the screen, either.  Your Personal Trainer is here to help, even if you haven't done much cooking and aren't familiar with common methods and techniques.  Don't know the proper way to cut a pepper?  The software reads the steps aloud to you, and photo references are available if you need to check your work.  Many steps even have video tutorials you can launch if you get stuck.  In the settings menu you can choose a speed you want directions read.  The software uses time stretch technology to extend or shorten the dialogue.  While viewing the ingredients for any recipe you can add items you need to your shopping list.  The list also includes a calculator in case you need to pinch pennies in the grocery aisle.",

        "Content": "  The Castlevania series has a lot to live up to on DS, and with Order of Ecclesia being the product of over three years of pocket dual screen, there's even more on the line than ever.  With Dawn of Sorrow, players were witness to the first DS Castlevania offering, borrowing from the best in Aria of Sorrow and bringing the innovative soul system to Nintendo's new handheld with added touch elements, wireless connectivity ,and elements within the overall package that had players doubting whether Symphony of the Night was truly the grand-daddy of the franchise at all.  With Portrait of Ruin, the franchise admittedly lost a bit of its footing, bringing in a two-character system with swap elements between Jonathan and Charlotte, but losing a bit of its direction while creeping outside the comfort zone of Dracula's castle, and instead diving into a more open design.  Two years have passed since we've had a new offering from Iga and his team, but with the first showing of Order of Ecclesia we knew the man behind one of Konami's longest-lasting franchises was onto something.  Castlevania was back, and with all the hype behind it being the third game in the series, the \"Aria of Sorrow of DS\", or the pocket game that would finally put the nail in the coffin on Symphony of the Night, Ecclesia has big shoes to fill.  And it fills them wonderfully.  Love it or hate it, the bosses will break you.  Whether Order of Ecclesia is better than Dawn of Sorrow remains to be seen for this reviewer, as with any good Castlevania game it isn't about how the game plays during its first time through, but time after time, dozens upon dozens of hours in, after long holiday breaks full of level grinding and endless searches for the final item in the game.  After going the distance with the product though, putting the final hit on the lord of darkness, and watching the final credits roll (yes, the real final credits), I can say with confidence that Order of Ecclesia is a must-buy package, the hardest post-Symphony game in the series, and a title that -- while not always perfect -- is most certainly going to live up to its hype.  In many ways, Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is a return to roots for the series, and in many other ways, a huge step in a very different direction.  For starters, the game is very difficult.  Not Contra 4 tough, but up there for sure.  In fact, as a huge Castlevania fan (enough of one to write a gigantic retrospective on the series, in fact) I pride myself on having died only a few times in any of the DS or GBA games, and that includes the very difficult Circle of the Moon on GBA.  In Order of Ecclesia, I've seen the death stage over 30 times in 12 hours; rookies to the series may see it three or four times that when all is said and done.  Order of Ecclesia is tough, but for those that have taken the series through its paces, and are looking for a serious challenge, this Castlevania game finally delivers a true veteran's game .  You will die in Order of Ecclesia.  Really though, it's a mountain of changes that make up Ecclesia's design, and rather than coming together as a definitive \"masterpiece of the platform\" title like Aria of Sorrow did, Ecclesia is more of a trailblazing game; the beginning of an era, rather than the end of one.    There's no Belmont clan this time around, and by extension, no Vampire Killer whip (at least not within the main story line).  You won't find Richter, Julius, or Simon, Alucard has no integral part within the tale, and there's no Morris clan to pick up the slack.  There's just Shanoa, and the new Glyph system.  As a main point of question with Ecclesia, no, the Glyph system isn't quite like the souls from Dawn of Sorrow, or the magic and skills from Portrait of Ruin.  Up to this point (one playthrough finished) I haven't found a single Glyph that can be built up from capturing more of the same over and over again, there aren't any physical weapons to rely on if you aren't a fan of the system, and oddly enough, there isn't as much variety in the types of weapons and spells as I initially thought.  By the time you finish your first playthrough, yes, you'll find some pretty crazy spells, summons, transformations -- yes, transformations -- and weapons in the Glyph system, but the first half of the game or so will be spent tracking down a few initial Glyphs in the game -- a sword, axe, lance, bow, and knife -- and then finding the next level of that same Glyph again, and in most cases, a third time.  If you're expecting a barrage of strange magic and never-before-seen abilities right off the bat, you may be in for a slight disappointment.   But that goes hand in hand with the new design.  Without diving into hyperbole (or trying not to) I personally would consider the first five or so hours of the game to be an elaborate character-building introduction to Order of Ecclesia.  It isn't until after the game's main turning point that I really felt like I started my quest to take down the pure evil that resides within the game, and while it was a huge payoff, it brings up an interesting point with Order of Ecclesia.  The level-based design isn't the best idea.  Luckily, it doesn't last for the duration of the game.  In concept the idea works, but in execution, it just doesn't translate in a form that's better than the standard \"run around the castle, and come back to areas you couldn't traverse before\".  The idea in Order of Ecclesia is for players to step out of the castle itself, and in doing so can check out other areas entirely.  And while that aspect works -- you can traverse a sunken ship, head through mountain regions, check out a haunted prison, and take refuge in a small town that you'll ultimately rebuild person by person -- you're also limited in a big way by the design as well.  The new locales are impressive this time around.  Areas are almost entirely linear -- I had 100% in the majority of the stages after my first walk through them - and with more areas comes smaller amounts of rooms per area.  Without naming specifics, one such stage has as little as five rooms, with others clocking in at a slightly larger 10, 13, 20, 26, and 28 rooms respectively.  There are a few other large ones -- and players that know the Castlevania series can guess at what comes with the back half of the game -- but with that small of an area to traverse, you're getting more tilesets, but less game made up of it.  In addition, many of the larger areas are made up of clone rooms (areas made 100% like other spots in the same map, which can then be called by the game from the same tile layout, thus effectively getting that room for free as far as cart space goes), and even those often don't add much a far as in-level traps or props.  Games like Symphony of the Night often are small in room count, but feel extremely full, adding in lots of switches, in-level props and objects (swinging pendulums, rotating gears, mine carts, water-filling puzzles).  With Ecclesia, the first half of the game is extremely straightforward, almost like a classic Castlevania game that loses the ability to kill players from falling in pits, instead expecting you to just run through each room one after another with very little reason to ever come back.    There's a bright side to it all though, which comes with the villager system and second half of the game.  With the initial 50% or so, you'll be on a quest to recover every villager in the small town of Wygol.  After retrieving each villager, you'll not only open the ability to add a general store to the town, but also start to slowly fill it with products from the town's jewelry maker, butcher, blacksmith, tailor, and more, and get additional quests from those characters as well.  This could include anything from photographing specific enemies with the game's camera, recording specific audio with a phonograph, killing a set amount of enemy types, or combining herbs or meat to make additional food items or potions.  Once done you'll not only often be rewarded with cash or additional prizes, but also open up those items in the general store.  In this way, the first half of the game is more about building your character's home base, and less about the actual mission at hand.  My only real complaint here; I wanted more quests and items.   And without going too in depth on what follows after the franchise's now famous \"turning point\" in the game -- you know, where titles like Symphony of the Night literally flipped things upside down on players in the past -- this second half is where players will really feel like the game finally gets down to business.  That isn't to say the first half of the story wasn't fun, or that knowing what I know now I'd be put off by the design choice, but it's a much easier design to take on knowing that there's familiarity on the way, and that even if the level-based area -- in all its linear glory -- isn't for you, that there's at least some sort of traditional back half waiting.  In fact, it's here where you'll find all the amazing Glyphs you wanted in the first half, where you start debating your second playthrough of the game on hard with your newfound magical toys, and where you really embrace Shanoa as one of the first characters in Castlevania with true motivation to do what so many before her have done.  You'll see about 50% returning enemies, and about 50% entirely new ones.  The final serious aspect of the game's core design -- and this is the area you'll want to look out for spoilers in -- is the inevitable bonus content you get long after completing the main game.  As with tradition, many players have expected an additional play mode along with the already confirmed \"Hard Mode\" and online options, and it's in here.  Albus mode is in fact unlocked after beating the game the first time, though I'm still not sure if I'm as big of a fan of it as I was Julius or Richter Mode in previous games.  It's based mainly on his gun attacks, which are all long range and often have a bit of a reset time before you're allowed to move again after attacks, making it a slower form of combat than the original first playthrough.  I'll leave the rest to you, but for players looking for the core Castlevania experience, know that you'll find it here, but that it might be less of a triumphant Alucard Mode or the like, and more along the line of \"Sisters Mode\" or a lesser bonus playthrough.  Also, from what I can tell, there's no online Boss Rush mode, though the single-player option is of course included. Read on from here, spoil-o-phobics.   On the audio/visual side, Order of Ecclesia is hands-down the best offering in the series since Symphony of the Night, with amazing music, some great added unlockables that add even more to the audio design, some simply awesome boss designs, and beautiful overall art style.  The franchise has been taken in a bit of a different direction this time around, and it pays off wonderfully, as the music is inspired, nearly half of the game's enemies have been redesigned (or are completely new), and the portrait art is well done and beautiful.  In fact, with the newly-created art, and the fact that the DSi is looking to breathe new life into the DS library, I'm hoping Iga and his team can muster up an encore effort on DS, and go for a fourth Castlevania title for fans of the series, as the amount of artistic effort that went into this one should certainly allow for a second game within the same stylistic world.  If all these new enemies, animations, attacks, and locales were created just for one game, and then re-worked for whenever Nintendo's next system happens to come around, it'd feel like a waste after so many previous games having shared the same assets.

It takes a lot of time and effort to make one of these things, and the risks are only outweighed by the rewards; despite the dangers, everyone aspires to be the next World of Warcraft, and, often times, such a task is too much, and a large number of MMOs have crashed and burned.  Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning is not one of these games. It's an impressive beast. Not only is it one of the smoothest and most effortless MMO launches to date, but it's a game that displays careful thought in almost every aspect.    This is the long-awaited MMO realization of the dark and gritty world of Warhammer Fantasy, the popular tabletop game. For two decades, fans around the world have collected and painted figurines of fearsome orcs, noble elves, surly dwarves, twisted trolls, and more. Now you can create your own virtual avatar, choosing from six factions caught up in the Age of Reckoning, a sort of once-in-a-millennium throw-down between age-old enemies: The Dark Elves have invaded the home of the High Elves, the Dwarves are butting heads with their nemesis the Greenskins, and a Germanic-inspired Empire battles Chaos. This theme of war permeates throughout the game, giving focus and purpose to many of the quests, battles, and scenarios, as well as building up to potential cataclysmic events.  And, the great thing about Warhammer Online is that there's plenty to do. Fans of quests and player-versus-environment (PvE) gameplay will find no shortage of missions to accomplish. While it's possible to solo in quite a number of these, it's far easier and enjoyable to tackle them with another player or two. You can form a small, tight-knit group to blitz through the game together.  While many of the quests come in the form of the standard MMO mission -- kill X number of foozles here, or collect Y-number of certain flowers there -- Warhammer Online at least makes them easy with a helpful map system that lets you know what quests are easily accomplishable nearby.   The world has a nice diversity, from frosty mountains to gloomy swamps. Then there are public quests, which are larger, multi-stage PvE missions that may require a half-dozen players or more. The beauty of the public quest system is that there are a ton of them in the game, and that they are open to anyone passing by. You might start a public quest by yourself, but before long others will join in, a party will be formed, and you'll have fun steamrolling the bad guys together.  Next are player-versus-player (PvP) scenarios, which are the main form of \"instanced\" content in the game. These are faction battles, with Order players (those who selected to play as High Elves, Empire, or Dwarves characters) battling Destruction players (Dark Elves, Greenskins, and Chaos). Some of these scenarios are basically pure deathmatches (the first team to 500 points) while others have objectives, such as seizing and holding a strategic location or capturing and recovering a certain object. Often times there's a kicker in these missions, like holding a couple of locations that will aid your team by calling in a huge explosion that will force the opposing players to run for their lives.  Then there are the realm-versus-realm (RvR) battles, which take place on the world map in areas where the forces of Order and Destruction come in contact and clash. These are battles to seize strategic keeps, and there's a lot more coordination necessary. Keeps have outlying camps that can be seized; doing so will either strengthen the defenses of the keep garrison (if your side is holding the keep) or weaken the garrison (if your side is attempting to lay siege to the keep).    The nice thing about Warhammer Online is that all of these are acceptable paths to play through the game. If you like solo or small parties, you can spend most of your time on quests and dabble every now and then with the larger-scale stuff. If you're into PvP you've got two different kinds to keep you happy, and it's easy to organize a party, a war band (a larger party), or a formal guild that has officers and tithes and even rules. And, it goes out of its way to give you rewards, so there are ways to get great loot if you just work at it hard enough. This is also a very social game; the levels are just the right size to offer room to explore, but they're so not big as to scatter the population of a server. The result is that you're always running across other players.  In terms of innovations, Warhammer Online doesn't do a lot that's radically new, but it does do everything very well. The game is easily accessible thanks to a variety of handy tools. For instance, take the Tome of Knowledge, an in-game, dynamic encyclopedia of your adventures. You can look up your quests, find your current kill counts, or read up on lore. It's also handy to keep track of the many achievements that you can amass; the game is layered with dozens upon dozens of rewards, from a catchy title (\"The Crucial Crusher\") to recognition when you die 100 times. It's these small things that add up, because you get a sense that everything has been woven together from the beginning, rather than having all these different parts simply being welded together at the end.   Why is it Dark Elves are always sultry? The experience curve is sufficient enough that you'll spend a lot of time to reach the maximum rank of 40, but it doesn't quite feel like you have to grind when you get up in levels. The sheer abundance of quests helps reduce the amount of mindless killing needed in some MMOs to accrue experience points, and doing well in a PVP scenario can bestow tons of experience. Warhammer Online does suffer sometimes from the feeling that you're not really in this amazing fantasy world but rather at some kind of virtual Disneyland, waiting for the ride (or in this case, a quest) to reset for you to have your fun. For instance, monsters respawn constantly (and in some cases, almost too frequently), making it feel like you're not really making any progress or difference in the world. Still, this is a problem inherent in the genre and not unique to Warhammer Online.  There's something to be said for the polish of the game as well. Far too many MMOs launch with crippling issues, from server crashes to bugs. By comparison, Warhammer Online has been an incredibly smooth experience. Minor server-lag exists in some places, but only once has it been crippling. The client is stable, and the servers are accessible; even wait queues are fairly small during the busiest times of the day.   There's plenty of quests to pursue if you're not into PVP. Visually, the game doesn't push the graphical boundaries of PCs, but then it doesn't have to. A good art direction can substitute for razzle-dazzle, and the world of Warhammer Online is a diverse one. From the massive stone valleys of the Empire capital Altdorf to the mountain home of the dwarves, the grassy plains of the elves, there's a lot to see. Monsters are appropriately fearsome, from the hydras to the ugly and brutish trolls. Warhammer Online has a bright color palette, one that feels a bit out of place if you come to think of Warhammer Fantasy as a grim, muddy kind of world, but that's a minor quibble. The audio is adequate, but it doesn't really leave any kind of mark. It's hard to recall even a single melody from the game, and for the most part the audio concentrates on the atmosphere, from the rustle of leaves in the wind to the clop of horses' hooves on stone.  The $80 Collector's Edition carries a hefty premium, but it does serve up some nice extras. The large, felt-lined box features a graphic novel, an art book, and an exclusive miniature. In-game extras include some custom character options, 12 exclusive quests, and a short-time bonus that allows you to earn extra experience. It's a nice amount of content, but you do pay $30 more than the regular version."

        "Content": "Any doubt about the iPhone's status as a true gaming platform -- one capable of entertaining both hardcore gamers and casual players -- is finally silenced by the release of Gameloft's Asphalt 4: Elite Racing . Yes, the App Store is full of cheapie homebrew games not without their charm (some of those $2 one-man-shows are pretty cool), but Asphalt 4 proves that the iPhone has some serious horsepower under the hood. This system is far more capable than a regular PlayStation. It's approaching the Dreamcast when under the thumbs of a crackerjack development team, and Gameloft's code squad is apparently just that kind of team.  Elite Racing is the fourth chapter in Gameloft's long-running mobile racing series. The Asphalt games have been a monster success for the France-based publisher, selling second only to I-play's Fast and the Furious racing games. In this installment, you race the world's biggest cities such as Los Angeles, Shanghai, and Paris with an entire garage full of licensed cars. You start out with only a Mini Cooper, but within just a few races, you have a growing stockpile of real-world wheels, such as Corvettes and Ferraris. You can also race motorcycles, including Ducati and Kawasaki.   Gameloft has always -- always -- placed enormous emphasis on production values and Asphalt 4 only serves to further bolster that reputation. This is not only the best-looking racing game on the iPhone, but it is the best-looking iPhone game as of yet. The car models are ridiculously well detailed and look remarkably like the real vehicles. The cities are expertly crafted with tons of landmarks, lighting effects, and wonderful splashes of color. Plus, the game moves fast. Only occasionally did Asphalt 4 stutter on my iPhone, and when it did chug, the game was quick to recover.  Asphalt 4 offers several different events, such as basic racing, playing crash-and-bash with rival cars (not entirely unlike Burnout), head-to-head races, and jumping behind the wheel of a police cruiser and taking down unlawful street racers. I really liked the Cash Attack event, where you bank green by performing jumps and smashing into other cars. But even just straightforward racing is good. There's a certain pleasure to punching the nitro just as you clip the back bumper of a rival car and send him into the guard rail. Sadly, there is no crash damage, though.  In addition to these events, Gameloft offers a full-featured Wi-Fi multiplayer mode than works very, very well. Once you complete the single-player game, Wi-Fi gives the game another few hours of play by pitting you against your other friends with iPhones or iPod Touches.  There is a lot of game in here. I know $10 feels a little steep, especially after being ripped off by bare bones ports of Pac-Man for the same price, but Asphalt 4 is absolutely worth it. There are dozens of races in here. After completing a race, you earn cash and new car parts. The garage lets you customize your cars as you wish, from paint jobs to exhaust systems. An on-screen stat system shows you how each new part affects you car.  There are three different control options in Asphalt 4: Tap, tilt, and a virtual steering wheel you drag your finger over. By far, my favorite control scheme was tilt. The sensitivity felt just right -- after a couple laps, I felt completely in control of the car. To hit your nitro boost, just dip the iPhone forward or press the little nitro button on the screen. I liked the dip motion. Just pushing the phone forward like I was jamming down on a gas pedal really works and I hope other game makers consider replicating it. The tap controls are functional (you tap the left and right sides of the screen to steer), but I don't like putting my fingers over the game field very much. There is a lot of gorgeous real estate here and I don't want to block it with my sausages. The virtual steering wheel was my least favorite, although sliding my finger over the wheel did work. It's just that the tilt controls are so strong, the other two paled in comparison. You can change out the controls at any time by touching a control icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.   This game was reviewed with version 1.2.0."

        "Content": "After spending time with NHL 19, exploring its different modes and customization options, I think it might be my favorite hockey game. Scratch that \u2014 I think NHL 19 is one of my favorite sports games, period. It uses the same animation engine as Madden and FIFA, has excellent presentation and atmosphere, and the players look like who they\u2019re supposed to look like.  Part of NHL 19\u2019s appeal is its accessibility. You don\u2019t need to keep up with every iteration of the series to immediately jump in and have a good time. One of the first things it asks you to do is choose a play style based on your personal skill level. Are you a complete EA NHL rookie? NHL 19\u2019s got your back with the option to play with a simplified rule set and NHL \u201894 controls. A seasoned vet looking to show off your puck-handling skills? The skill stick option lets you flex your muscles on the ice. Hybrid controls meet somewhere in the middle. It\u2019s awesome how NHL 19 can be played by anyone at any skill level.  Commentary is improved over last year, too, so it doesn\u2019t repeat as often. It feels like television commentary, responding well to the on-ice action. A great menu system allowing you to pin your favorite modes lets you drop into games quickly, and a decent soundtrack all add up to something wonderful.   Ice to Meet You  It\u2019s also overflowing with choice, from a generous number of modes (both online and offline) to a dizzying number of create-a-player options. It\u2019s disappointing that you can only choose from premade faces, but I\u2019m impressed at how thoroughly you can personalize your custom players, especially the different options for authentic hockey-player mullets. But it gets way more granular than that, right down to the color of the laces on your skates and the tape on your stick, which can be independently set for the shaft and the blade. Many of the customization options are locked behind tasks and challenges, but they\u2019re not prohibitively difficult so unlocking them is a satisfying treat rather than a chore. The sheer amount of options is staggering, to the point where it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed no two players will look the same. Somewhat confusingly, there\u2019s more than one mode requiring a custom created hockey player, but annoyingly, you can\u2019t use the same guy for both for some reason. EA Sports Ones is far and away my favorite of the excellent online modes. \u201c  EA Sports Ones is far and away my favorite of the excellent online modes, beating out Drop-in Threes and EASHL league mode for that title. It\u2019s an absolute free-for-all on a frozen pond, with three players pitted against one another and all of them battling the CPU-controlled goalie. It\u2019s a fast, arcade-style online mode where you can play as dirty as you want. I found myself waiting for my opponents to tie up so I could skate at them, top-speed, to throw the kind of body check that would get me thrown off the ice in any other mode. It\u2019s some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in a hockey game, and I was smiling the entire length of every match up. Ones mode seems like it would be incredibly well suited to local game matchups, so it\u2019s a bummer that it\u2019s limited to online play only.  NHL Threes has a similar arcade style but, thankfully, can be played in single-player as well as local co-op or online. Threes retains the same ridiculousness as last year, thanks to arcade-style gameplay and the opportunity to unlock and play as mascots. But even when it looks delightfully absurd, it retains the solid, fast, and fun gameplay at the core of NHL 19.   Cool Runnings  Once again, NHL 19 has a thorough training mode, showing you how to pull off every move, from basic passing and shooting to advanced, ridiculous through-the-legs tricks. The training mode doesn\u2019t cover all the possibilities, but an adaptive hint system will fill you in during gameplay, showing how and when to execute certain moves. After playing online, I know I need to spend some serious time in training if I hope to break my losing streak in Ones. The cost of new packs are out of whack with the denominations of points offered. \u201c  Hockey Ultimate Team is here once again, and it\u2019s par for the course. I\u2019m not a fan of its microtransactions, nor am I a fan of how its pricing scheme is laid out. Similarly to NBA Live 19, the cost of new packs are out of whack with the denominations of points offered. Just let me spend my real money buying the packs, not points to redeem for packs. That being said, I\u2019m glad that the damage they do is limited strictly to this mode. To EA\u2019s credit, Ultimate Team is at least pretty generous with letting you earn card packs, especially if you\u2019ve played an EA NHL game in the past \u2013 you get a pretty sweet collection of packs right off the bat as a reward for loyalty. It\u2019s a nice touch, and I was even able to pull a Tim Horton from one of my free packs.  Over in Franchise mode, I spent WAY too much time creating an NHL expansion rebirth for the Hartford Whalers. The management options are hugely robust, to the point where I was afraid to go any further without building a spreadsheet to keep track of anything. Setting stadium parking for the NHL expansion franchise, along with seating, salary caps, and tons more is part of the experience. I definitely appreciate the fantastic and intimidating depth here, even if I won\u2019t spend the majority of my NHL 19 time playing it.  Every IGN NHL Review Ever 23 Images  Be a Pro career mode is my favorite \u201cstraight-hockey\u201d way to play. Starting off as a mulleted 17-year-old from Augusta, Maine, NHL 19 gave me the choice to start in the Canadian Hockey League and work my way up or skip it entirely and go immediately to the NHL Draft. Shortcuts like that and the ability to simulate games based on team and player attributes if you don\u2019t feel like running through the motions of a lopsided match keep things moving along nicely, and I still felt like I earned my spot in the rookie class by playing the contentious games."

        "Content": "After trading fisticuffs with a Transformer, cartwheeling around a bullet-spewing tank controlled by evil clowns, and using a moose to buck my way through killer robots, it\u2019s safe to say that there are very few games \u2013 if any \u2013 quite like Nier: Automata. At different times it\u2019s a hack-and-slash, an RPG, a shoot-\u2018em-up, a brawler, and even a text adventure. But no matter which style it is at any given moment, this dazzling hybrid delivers 30-plus hours of fantastically fun action, remarkable locations, and a story so weird I doubt I\u2019ll forget it anytime soon.   Nier: Automata takes place in a desolate but stunning futuristic dystopia where humanity has fled to the moon after an extraterrestrial invasion, leaving behind an army of androids to fight the aliens\u2019 more primitive but prolific machines. It\u2019s a world where lush green tendrils of ivy coil around the massive skeletal remains of crumbling skyscrapers and tears of rust streak down the sides of old factories, with rotund buildings and looming cranes dominating the skyline. Automata\u2019s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing. \u201c  Automata\u2019s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing to look at on the PlayStation 4, but especially on the PlayStation 4 Pro. It doesn\u2019t go above 1080p on the Pro, but colors appear fresh and vivid, while better lighting and shading bring the world into sharper focus. I did encounter a few hiccups that knocked the frame rate below 60fps and witnessed a fair share of texture pop-in, but they only pockmarked Automata\u2019s lovely features ever so slightly. That, or I was too enchanted with the soaring, chorus-filled soundtrack to really notice; Automata will definitely be joining its predecessor\u2019s score on my playlist.  The story that takes place amongst the tumbled remains of abandoned superstructures is bizarre and entertaining, if somewhat haphazard. First as an android named 2B and later as other characters experiencing the same events from different perspectives, your job is to fight the alien machines and bring an end to the war. The quirky, full-tilt drama that unfolds as you bounce between Earth and the moon is an intriguing one, touching on existential themes like the meaning of life and humanizing those on the other side of war. It works, for the most part, due to a couple of bonkers plot twist and well-done voice acting that helps sell the more outlandish bits of allegory.   Like its predecessors Nier and Drakengard, Automata does have an unfortunate tendency to wander into uber-convoluted territory, and this is where problems start to arise. Try as I might, I couldn\u2019t always understand what was happening,  even after I played through several of Automata\u2019s multiple endings. There are also some emotional moments that struck me as forced. It's as if the game's lead writer Yoko Taro wanted to make me cry and was casting about for ways to make that happen. (To be fair, one event did have me pretty darn misty-eyed.)  I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier. \u201c The bigger issue was the disconnect I felt from 2B and her fellow androids. Their personal dramas take too long to unwind, which prevented me from fully investing in their fates. Why should I weep or cheer for them if I\u2019m not given a reason until 20 hours in? With that said, I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier pop up to help clarify the connection between it and Automata. Their presence brought about a welcome sense of nostalgia and helped bring closure to Nier: Gestalt's open-ended finale.  I didn\u2019t feel much of a rapport with the heroes, but I definitely enjoyed playing as them. There\u2019s an incredible sense of freedom that comes with effortlessly surfing sand dunes in the desert and shimmying up the concrete remains of office buildings in Automata\u2019s open world. Parkouring plays a big role here, and it\u2019s highly enjoyable thanks to ultra-fluid controls and a very smart camera that effortlessly tracks the action no matter how insane things get. And things get pretty nuts: Automata\u2019s different flavors of combat are a maniacal, supersonic affair, and a total blast to play.   Automata is described as an action RPG, but it\u2019s really an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of game. In between hearty chunks of feel-good hack-and-slash, you\u2019ll trade a fireworks display worth of projectiles with flying enemies, hack into robot mainframes, read a text adventure or two, and even brawl with a pair of psychotic twins. This radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride, and I mean that literally: in one of the craziest, most beautiful action sequences I\u2019ve ever encountered, you\u2019ll fight atop a moving roller coaster while racing full speed through the dilapidated remains of a sun-kissed boardwalk. The radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride. \u201c  The majority of enemy encounters take place on the ground, in sun-dappled pine forests and submerged cityscapes. These seamlessly connected areas offer plenty of space to experiment with Automata\u2019s excellent free-flowing combat, which is where the gameplay shines best and brightest. The system is streamlined into a variety of light and heavy attacks that make it easy to leap, shoot, hack, and slash through giant metal serpents and giant arm-flailing bipeds whose hard knocks can only be avoided through quick thinking and nimble dexterity.   There\u2019s no stamina bar holding you back, and the ability to instantly swap out weapons with a light tap of the D-pad means you can go nuts stringing together long attack combos without the need to stop and catch your breath. Developer Platinum does an amazing job of delivering a seamless combat experience, which becomes all the more impressive as things get increasingly frenzied and you find yourself backspringing away from an angry mob in one direction while charging an oncoming panzer controlled by zombie clowns in the other direction.  Accompanying all the action are hyper-stylized animations of Automata\u2019s cybernetic heroes twirling oversized katanas over their heads and using axes to cut through hostile bits of iron with ballet-like precision. Each battle stance flows elegantly into the next, resembling a crazed version of tai-chi that makes the carnage as fun to watch as it is to play. In fact, combat is such an addicting experience that I often sought out evil animatronics even when they weren\u2019t in my path, just so I could cut them down with a broadsword so massive that in reality it would take three very strong men to lift it.  Automata loves to throw out increasingly zany combat scenarios: it\u2019s not unusual to be fighting in an arena full of robotic samurai, tanks, flying metal spheres, and whatever else it can think of to throw at you. Managing all this insanity requires changing tactics on the fly, which is where Automata\u2019s flexible customization system makes itself handy. Upgradable plug-in chips can be swapped out and freely stacked to adjust your androids\u2019 speed, strength, and defenses at any time. Foraging for nuts and bolts in the wild allows you to upgrade your weapons and AI battle pods, while consuming temporary buff and debuffs help to give you a leg up in battle, particularly during Automata\u2019s more punishing difficulty modes. You can even remove chips that provide HUD information for more of a challenge.   Ticking up the difficulty to white-knuckle levels of chaos was a rewarding way to test my combat skills, but it also meant raising the danger in corpse runs, which greatly increased the possibility of losing precious inventory if I failed to retrieve my body. Luckily, if I ever felt cornered I could just hop online and recruit the AI-controlled remains of another player to fight alongside me, or pilfer them for useful items. And if that didn\u2019t work, I could press a self-destruct button to do massive damage to the enemy (and my clothes). I could even wrest control of an opponent\u2019s mind by hacking into their system and force them to demolish their own allies. Unconventional battle tactics? Yup, but they sure are effective. There\u2019s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth. \u201c  Combat is the heart and soul of Automata, but there\u2019s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth. Fun money-making enterprises like fishing and hunting are available, and I\u2019m very happy to report that the animal-riding mechanics of the original Nier \u2013 complete with car-like drifting capabilities \u2013 return. There are also a number escort missions and fetch quests you can do on the side. These missions aren\u2019t always exciting, but they help fill in backstory and reward you with money and rare loot upon completion.  My favorite moments, however, were the ones I made up myself. More than once I stopped the action to scale the far-reaching heights of an office building and drink in the sunset, or stood atop a massive tree limb to survey the land below me. These quiet, zen-like moments were a welcome reprieve between bouts of overcaffeinated combat. I loved it, and I loved the game for allowing me to do it.   At this point I should note that you do need to wait for Automata to fully download before you play it, otherwise there\u2019s a high probability of coming across a game-breaking bug about three hours in. I also crashed out twice during a couple of particularly intense boss fights, which was a pain in the butt since there's no auto-save and I had to start the battles over again. Still, spread out over 30 hours of gameplay that\u2019s not the worst thing in the world."

        "Content": "Those of you who\u2019ve played Forza Horizon 3 might remember spotting a snow-covered peak thrusting up into the sky, deep in the distant background. You couldn\u2019t drive there; it was merely a decorative tease.  Well, it isn\u2019t anymore. Forza Horizon 3\u2019s first paid expansion, Blizzard Mountain, has arrived, and has brought with it a driving experience like never before seen in the series.  And it\u2019s very, very good.  The differences between Blizzard Mountain and Forza Horizon 2\u2019s equivalent Storm Island expansion are immediate. Storm Island features wilder and windier weather than the standard inclement conditions in Forza Horizon 2 but the environment itself is largely similar to the main game. It\u2019s really more of the same, with the rain going sideways.  Blizzard Mountain, by contrast, is not more of the same. Or, at least, not in terms of the environment. Blizzard Mountain is, if you\u2019ll excuse the pun, the polar opposite to Forza Horizon 3\u2019s existing sun-scorched desert, pristine beaches, and dense bush. It\u2019s icy roads, treacherous drops, powder-filled paddocks, and huge elevation changes.  Visually it\u2019s amongst developer Playground Games\u2019 best work yet, which is some achievement considering much of the landscape\u2019s nuance is largely hidden under a thick blanket of plain white. Gum trees are dusted in snowflakes and strips of asphalt glint beneath slush-filled wheel ruts. During clear, sunny days the light beams authentically off the snow. It\u2019s similar in some ways to the stark brightness of Forza Horizon 3\u2019s outback area but it trades the desert\u2019s oppressive, orange-tinted heat for a noticeably cooler feel thanks to the terrific global-illumination system. That snow simple pickup truck.  The new weather effects (blizzards, because it\u2019s not just a clever name) are astounding; trees rock violently, show swirls, and visibility is reduced to a few car lengths. At night, the effect is amplified. It\u2019s a stunning spectacle to drive through, if a little nerve wracking in Horizon 3\u2019s faster cars.  There really isn\u2019t any area in which Playground has skimped on detail. \u201c Your car\u2019s bodywork will be convincingly caked in snow as you drive around, and tyres collect snow in their tread. There\u2019s a nice new effect for snowflakes hitting windscreens, distinct from the excellent rain effects from the main game. You\u2019ll even find your driver is now sporting a suitably festive woolly jumper. There really isn\u2019t any area in which Playground has skimped on detail.  It\u2019s definitely a shame the Blizzard Mountain world itself is a standalone environment rather than more elegantly weaved into the existing world (it would\u2019ve been nice to see how the team would\u2019ve blended it in, like The Crew\u2019s world) but it\u2019s not a gripe I\u2019ve dwelled on much.  The introduction of snow into the world of Forza Horizon 3 is much more than a cosmetic shift, too, because the driving dynamics are radically changed here in Blizzard Mountain. There\u2019s deep snow to contend with off-road and some cars have a better time clawing through it than others; building momentum in it can be tricky. There\u2019s a large frozen lake where grip is reduced massively and you suddenly need to begin thinking of your next move twice as early as you may be used to. There are even hazardous sections of glaze ice on many of the mountain\u2019s courses (usually cunningly placed in braking zones or apexes) which have a similarly devastating effect on handling as Forza Motorsport 6\u2019s standing puddles. Avoid them, because once you drop a wheel onto that ice you\u2019re a passenger. License to thrill.  Blizzard Mountain isn\u2019t entirely unlike Storm Island; like its forebear it operates as a smaller, self-contained version of the main game. There are 50 roads to discover, as opposed to 488 on the Forza Horizon 3 map, but it\u2019s smattered with a familiar assortment of race types and activities like drift zones, speed traps, danger signs, and a handful of new Bucket List challenges.  What Playground has done here, however, is shake up the progression system. Basically, it demands slightly more of us than the main game does. Rather than amassing fans on Blizzard Mountain we need to unlock stars, which are awarded for various levels of success in events. For instance, simply completing a race will net you a single star, and winning a race will score you two. To get all three stars, however, you\u2019ll need to win and fulfil a separate objective in the process, like amassing a certain number of skill points or some such. It means the outcome of a race matters more in Blizzard Mountain than it does in the main game, and higher stakes are (almost) always a good thing.  The hurdle here is that I\u2019ve found that sometimes the tasks are at odds with simply driving smoothly and fast, so it can be tough to dominate hard-level AI while also making sure you execute, say, 35 drifts during a sprint event. To conquer the challenges that are generally counterintuitive to quick driving I found myself dialling down the opponent AI from what I usually race against. So long, Frosty.  There\u2019s a real off-road flavour to Blizzard Mountain and that has informed the eight new cars included with the new map, a mix of rally monsters, trophy trucks, and utilities (the star vehicle is Ken Block\u2019s 2016 Ford Focus RS RX, as seen in Block\u2019s recent GYMKHANA 9 stunt special, and it\u2019s mental). Of course, we don\u2019t need to stick with those; all of the cars I tried from my extensive Horizon 3 garage could be fitted with snow tyres and taken out on the slopes.  If you\u2019re more partial to Horizon 3\u2019s road cars and urban street racing, Blizzard Mountain may not do a huge deal for you, but I do feel the drastically different environment and handling properties make this expansion pack well worth its asking price for any Forza fan."

        "Content": "Almost since the beginning, Star Wars has been a story of redemption from darkness. So, in an ironic sort of way, Battlefront 2 is a better Star Wars game because of its initial fall to the dark side and subsequent journey back to the light. After over two years of updates and changes, EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date. You may also like: Best Star Wars Games Star Wars Battlefront 2 Wiki Star Wars Battlefront 2 Tips Taking in all Battlefront 2 now has to offer at once is honestly a bit overwhelming. Setting aside the overly safe, short, and disappointing single-player story, there\u2019s a wealth of wave-based co-operative maps and a litany of online competitive multiplayer modes. Most of them play wonderfully and they all ooze that classic Star Wars look and feel on an unrivaled scale. Whether you\u2019re fighting on the ground with a blaster in your hands, cutting down troops with a lightsaber, or dogfighting in space, Battlefront 2 is an immensely entertaining ride through a galaxy far, far away. Every IGN Star Wars Game Review 113 Images Crucially, DICE absolutely nailed the basics. Take the mechanics of firing a blaster: It feels just a bit chunky, as it should, with that signature sound bursting with each shot. And even though every weapon shoots similar-looking bolts, they all feel extremely distinct out of the box and can be customized further. Crucially, DICE absolutely nailed the basics. For ground troops, the four main classes are Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist. They feel about as distinct as any other classes in a multiplayer shooter, although none of them have a dedicated secondary gun to swap too. Since there are no ammo counts, just cool downs, it changes the dynamic a bit and definitely feels unique. I gravitated towards the Heavy troopers because of their powerful LMG-style weapon, mobile shield, grenade, and a special that let me shoot continuously like a minigun without overheating. It\u2019s excellent for suppressing fire, especially if you\u2019re on the defending end of the final phase in Capital Supremacy and need to keep the enemy back at all costs. In between the main classes and the big hero units are specialty units like Arc Troopers that get electric mines and dual pistols, or rolling Droidekas with heavy armor and deployable shield domes. Coordinating attacks between the practicality of the standard troops and flashiness of heroes is a lot fun and makes Battlefront 2 feel special. Microtransaction Reaction Shortly before Battlefront 2 officially launched in 2017 it was filled with egregious microtransactions that were not only greedy, but disruptive to the game as a whole. If you didn\u2019t want to grind for hours to unlock playable heroes then you had to pay actual money. Star Card upgrades were locked behind similar time-sinks and pay walls that made multiplayer feel like more of a chore than a game. Thankfully, EA listened to feedback and removed those just ahead of launch, but the grindy progression remained. Fast forward a couple of years, though, and, all of that\u2019s now been removed as well. Today, the only things you can buy are cosmetics like new outfits and emotes, so there\u2019s no hint of pay-to-win in play. Star Cards are completely gone, leveling is now based on linear XP gains, and all heroes are open from the beginning. Alternatively, you can earn these cosmetics through loot boxes you can\u2019t pay for. It\u2019s a good, fair system, and thankfully entirely separate from progression \u2013 that makes these boxes exciting to open because the cosmetics don\u2019t come at the cost of character upgrades and unlocks. Or, if you buy or upgrade to the Celebration Edition of Battlefront 2, every paid cosmetic, emote, and victory pose is unlocked from the very beginning. What\u2019s great about Battlefront 2 is that it lets you play with all of its toys, no questions asked. Every character class and playable hero is available from the start, and the tedious unlocking grind from launch has been completely removed. Luke, Vader, Boba Fett, Rey \u2013 you name them, they\u2019re all here. As you level up you unlock new ability cards with passive upgrades such as increased health regeneration speed or a bigger grenade blast radius. They\u2019re designed as ways to refine your playstyle, rather than make you dramatically stronger, and it\u2019s a fulfilling system that rewards sticking with a class without forcing you to. You\u2019ll spend most of your time as Battlefront\u2019s basic soldier classes, but as you play you earn in-match points that you can eventually spend to spawn as a hero. That can seriously turn the tide. These iconic characters are absolute killing machines, and when you clash with another hero it\u2019s extremely memorable. The list has been growing since launch and now includes everybody from Obi-Wan and his Force push to lesser favorites like General Grievous, including his ridiculous saber windmill attack. Pitting original trilogy Darth Vader against the prequel trilogy Anakin Skywalker hero is far more entertaining than it should be. These fights can be truly the stuff of Star Wars \u201cWhat If?\u201d fan-fiction, brought to life on screen. These fights can be truly the stuff of Star Wars \u201cWhat If?\u201d fan-fiction, brought to life on screen. During a Heroes v Villains match \u2013 a team deathmatch mode where everybody plays as a hero the entire time \u2013 I was playing as Boba Fett on the rainy planet Kamino and ran into an enemy player controlling Obi-Wan. It quickly felt like a reenactment of the Jedi Knight\u2019s fight against Jango Fett in Episode II. In this version, Obi-Wan leapt through the air while I shot at him with my blasters, then he Force-pushed me and knocked me down before charging in for the kill with his lightsaber. Then, in a dramatic twist, none other than Darth Vader himself jumped in at the last second and Force-choked him before he could strike. My teammate then lifted Obi-Wan into the air for me to finish him off. It was a fantastic and memorable moment. It doesn\u2019t feel like an exaggeration to say that, in terms of scope and breadth, EA and DICE have released just as much new, free content for the multiplayer side of Battlefront 2 as it already had at launch. They\u2019ve dished out new maps like Felucia and Geonosis, exciting new game modes, a litany of heroes and villains, new ships for aerial combat, and dozens of cosmetic skins. Battlefront 2\u2019s maps now feel like a Greatest Hits selection of the entire Star Wars galaxy, pulling from all three movie trilogies plus one-offs and the cartoons. The dense greenery of Felucia is a great contrast to the brown wastelands of Geonosis, and fighting across the Cloud City in Bespin is a blast. Naboo\u2019s capital city, Theed, is one of my favorites, since it\u2019s an outdoor urban setting, unlike most of the other battles, and is full of buildings that make it a great stage in the larger 40-player game modes. Every mode has an extreme level of map variety, and that makes it easy to fall into that \u201cjust one more game\u201d mentality because you\u2019ll see something new every time for a long while. Every Planet and Location in Star Wars Battlefront 2's Multiplayer 18 Images The catch is that finding a match is hit or miss depending on the game mode and time of day. It\u2019s not very difficult to queue up for the main modes like Capital Supremacy and Galactic Assault, especially on PS4. But smaller modes, like Hero Showdown and Hero Starfighters, can take a few minutes of waiting before you can enjoy them, which is a shame. They\u2019re not the main attraction by any means but I\u2019ve had some good fun with them. In Hero Showdown, two teams of two heroes each face off without respawns for multiple rounds. It\u2019s a bit like Gun Fight in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but instead of guns and knives it\u2019s blasters and lightsabers. Similarly, Hero Starfighters pits two teams of four hero ships against each other, but this time dying brings you back as a standard starfighter until one team has lost all their hero ships. Letting you immediately take control of these recognizable characters is awesome, putting a fun spin on the standard modes, but they don\u2019t seem to command the same amount of popularity. Having so many different modes to choose from seems to have split the player base thinly across the best ones. Did you play Star Wars Battlefront 2 at launch, and will you come back to it now? No, and I'm still not interested. No, but now I'm interested in trying it. Yes, but I'm not coming back to it. Yes, and now I want to pick it back up. Yes, and I kept playing it over the years. Answer See Results The least popular modes, like the capture-based Jetpack Cargo or Blast (which is just team deathmatch), are often complete dead zones with no players at all \u2013 they were never as thrilling as the larger-scale battles, but I don\u2019t always want to spend 30-40 minutes in a single match, so having something quicker and faster-paced available would have been nice. I was never left unable to play, though, because the Quick Play option is a reliable fallback that will always drop you into what\u2019s hot if you aren\u2019t picky. That said, the limited choice queues cause can occasionally be disappointing all the same. It\u2019s also a bummer when the only active mode is something you don\u2019t want to play at all, like Ewok Hunt or one of the Starfighter battles for the third time in a row. Capital Supremacy mode is both one of the busiest and one of the best. Thankfully, the recently added Capital Supremacy mode is both one of the busiest and one of the best. It\u2019s similar to the traditional Galactic Assault mode, in that they\u2019re both large-scale battles with 40 players fighting over control points, but there are some big differences. Here, holding control points in the first phase earns you AI reinforcements, and then the winning team boards transport shuttles to try to take over the other team\u2019s capital ship. If they fail, the first phase starts over. It creates an epic tug-of-war, pushing and pulling across space and the planet\u2019s surface and can easily take upwards of 30 minutes to finish a single match. The settings and power dynamic are all extremely reminiscent of both the Clone Wars and the massive battles in DICE\u2019s Battlefield series. Galactic Assault evokes a similarly grandiose feeling, but instead of changing maps partway through depending on progress, the levels are more multifaceted from the beginning. In Galactic Assault, all three types of warfare are happening at the same time: aerial fighters, ground vehicles, and foot soldiers. The objectives vary depending on the map, but usually involve capturing points, escorting large ground units like walkers, overriding systems, or planting bombs. Galactic Assault can take a while, but it\u2019s the only game mode that spans all three eras. Matches of Galactic Assault can take a while, but it\u2019s the only game mode that spans all three eras across over a dozen different maps, so I really felt like I was reenacting actual movie moments. For example, trying to take out a TIE Fighter with a rocket launcher or strafing across a planet\u2019s surface in an X-Wing while blowing up Storm Troopers is enormous fun. Note that while Capital Supremacy currently only covers Clone Wars locations, it\u2019s getting updated in early 2020 to include sequel trilogy content in addition to other Rise of Skywalker-related updates coming to Battlefront 2. The fact that EA continues to push out updates for a game that\u2019s over two years old, especially after such a rocky launch, is extremely commendable. We haven\u2019t seen that new content yet, but if it\u2019s of similar caliber to past updates then it will only serve to make Battlefront 2 even better. A Lackluster Campaign The campaign in Battlefront 2 is unchanged since our original review, other than the addition of a new epilogue chapter, titled Resurrection. Unfortunately, this doesn't add much more than an extra two hours to bridge the gap between the main campaign and the sequel trilogy of films. Overall, it's no better nor worse other than being slightly longer. Everything else Tom Marks said in his original review about the campaign rings true to this day: \"It mostly follows the story of Imperial Special Forces commander Iden Versio \u2013 a fierce leader who still manages to express compassion from her position within the Empire \u2013 from the final moments of Return of the Jedi into the era of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Despite its darker choice of perspective (we haven\u2019t seen much from the Imperial soldier point of view since 1994\u2019s TIE Fighter), the plot moves forward in a fairly unimaginative fashion from there. It\u2019s a shame Iden doesn\u2019t get more time to develop as a character because Battlefront 2 does a decent job of introducing her (outside of some stilted dialogue in the opening scene) as a competent, sympathetic person. But Battlefront 2\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t really have much of a cohesive story to speak of in which for her to complete a believable arc. Instead, it feels more like a series of barely connected missions across a smattering of recognizable locations, featuring the major characters you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s essentially digital Star Wars tourism tied around the loose concept of Iden\u2019s battles in the final days of the Galactic Civil War. Not enough time is devoted to Iden and her relationships to give her pivotal decisions the context they need.\""

Gears 5\u2019s impressive campaign is conclusive evidence that, at least for now, it\u2019s these meatheads, not Halo\u2019s Spartan super soldiers, that star in the most endearing first-party stories on Xbox. Marcus Fenix, bless his curmudgeonly old heart, has now fully embraced his Papa Marcus role, and I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s along for the ride in Gears 5 as Kait tries to unravel the mystery of her past. Though this is unequivocally Kait\u2019s story, with actress Laura Bailey turning in a commanding performance in the lead role, it\u2019s actually Marcus who gets the single best line of dialogue (you\u2019ll know it when you hear it). Long may we be blessed with voice actor John DiMaggio\u2019s growling rage. But Del, too, has a much bigger part to play this time around, and both developer The Coalition and actor Eugene Byrd do an outstanding job of bringing him to life. Gears 5 Review Screenshots 26 Images The actors\u2019 performances are all vital to Gears 5, because this campaign is packed full of story. You\u2019ll have plenty of welcome controller-down time between the action to follow along with what\u2019s happening in this world of destroyed beauty. Gears 5 plumbs the depths of not only the lead characters themselves, but also the larger Gears universe\u2019s history of war. We see them struggle to justify terrible acts in the face of even worse choices, and we\u2019re forced to wonder if the ends really do justify the means.  Gears 5's Jack of All Trades Gears\u2019s third-person action has evolved slowly but steadily from one entry to the next, and in Gears 5 the bulk of what\u2019s new flows through Jack, your handy floating robot companion. He can now snag weapons from the battlefield for you and unlock safes, among other actions, and you\u2019ll earn new abilities for him to use in combat, such as flash-blinding your foes, reviving you and your allies when you\u2019re down, cloaking you, and more. Upgrade components are littered across the world, so you can decide to hyper-specialize in a few areas or have a little bit of every ability. I appreciated the extra tactical layers he offered, and while I did vary my selected Jack ability depending on the situation, I was particularly thankful for the healing power of Stim in the latter part of the campaign, which saved me from dying more than once. Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever 10 Images But Jack aside, boy oh boy does Gears\u2019 combat still feel good. This may be the only series where I\u2019m always happy to have the default weapon \u2013 the trusty Lancer \u2013 in my loadout at all times, just in case I get a chance to chainsaw a bad guy in half. The Overkill shotgun returns from Gears of War 4 and packs a potent punch, while classics like the Longshot, Boomshot, and Mulcher are still around to satisfyingly chew your foes into little fleshy chunks. New weapons like the Claw manage to feel unique but fit right in, too; Gears 5 does a tremendous job of balancing the old toys with new ones. Also new is Gears 5\u2019s open structure of its middle two acts. You\u2019ll roam the area on your wind-powered Skiff, free to tackle optional secondary objectives that vary in duration and challenge. Usually your reward is Jack upgrades, so they\u2019re very worth doing. This is a nice change of pace for Gears, just like it was for God of War last year -- who\u2019s to say whether that was by intention or coincidence, but the fact that the first of these sections is set in a frozen tundra only makes it harder to ignore the similarity). Multiple varied boss fights also help Gears 5 feel fresh throughout.  Waiting for Kait Though Gears 5\u2019s campaign has plenty of meat on the bone, clocking in at around 10-12 hours, it ends somewhat abruptly. Perhaps that\u2019s because it\u2019s the first mainline Gears that doesn\u2019t follow a linear five-act structure, but it\u2019s mostly because it doesn\u2019t offer any gameplay resolution after answering Kait\u2019s questions about her past. No, that\u2019s saved for the jumping-off point for the inevitable Gears 6. I can\u2019t help but compare it to the end of Halo 2, though the cutoff is not nearly as egregious here. Meanwhile, the graphics of Gears 5 may no longer be a jaw-dropping showpiece unrivaled in the rest of gaming, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t pretty. For starters, the jump to 4K and 60fps for the campaign on Xbox One X feels really good, aside from a few minor hitches here and there. And the use of atmospheric lighting \u2013 both in the world and on our heroes\u2019 armor \u2013 once again gives Gears a unique and gorgeous visual signature."

        "Content": "Every once in a while, one of those horror games comes along that gets mythologized as a harrowing experience best left alone by anyone without a taste for relentless, oppressive fear. Blair Witch definitely deserves a spot in that pantheon alongside Amnesia, Silent Hill, and their like. The many ways it manages to build tension and make me wonder if I\u2019m losing my mind with a fairly simple premise of being lost in some woods creates a wonderfully unsettling journey. And it even manages to break with the tradition of recent horror games by giving you limited ability to confront the nightmares without ever turning into a power fantasy. This trip to the edges of sanity placed me, in first-person perspective, back in the Black Hills Forest of the classic 1999 film The Blair Witch Project. It\u2019s rendered here in an eerie, muted color palette that adds to a sense of foreboding and helplessness with its spindly, grasping trees and rich but subtle sound design. During the day, I always got the impression that I was being watched, or that I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. At night, everything transforms into an oppressive, heart-pounding, sometimes disorienting nightmare that made me long for the limited relief the sun\u2019s rays could bring. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask And, true to the spirit of the franchise, the environments aren\u2019t afraid to play disorienting tricks on your mind by having paths loop back to places they shouldn\u2019t or moving key landmarks you thought you could use for navigation, so I was never fully able to get my bearings and map the area out in my head. While all of that is slightly frustrating, I found this to be very appropriate to the kind of mood that was being evoked. Party Like It\u2019s 1999 I appreciated the level of reverence shown for the original film as well, from little visual nods to a downright hellishly terrifying sequence that takes place in that old house from the finale. Blair Witch also fearlessly expands on the mythology while remaining respectful to some of the key premises, like the witch herself always existing as more of a malevolent presence than a monster that comes out to chase you. Ellis, the voiced protagonist, has his own complex, layered, and bone-chilling backstory to discover along the way. As someone with firsthand experience of post-traumatic stress and panic attacks, this is probably one of the most accurate artistic depictions I\u2019ve seen of those things. It was almost too real at some points, and I would caution others with similar experiences to be aware of that before jumping in. The major inclusion that makes it bearable is Bullet, your good boye German shepherd.The major inclusion that makes it bearable is Bullet, your good boye German shepherd who is ever alert for hidden items, can be used to follow scent trails from objective to objective, and even warns you with a low growl when danger is near. Sure, his AI isn\u2019t perfect, and there were a few times when he either got stuck on the other side of a doorway or had to perform some kind of complicated dance to line himself up and get through a small opening. But he\u2019s a welcome companion traipsing through the dark, oppressive underbrush and gave me a way to bring down my real world heart rate with some nice ear scratches after particularly stressful segments. Not only can you pet the dog in Blair Witch, you should, as how you treat him can also affect the ending. I\u2019m told there are at least four possible endings, though I was only able to see one across multiple playthroughs of the story, which took me a little over a dozen hours the first time through when I was trying to be through. This one was hauntingly bleak, though quite appropriate to the spirit of the franchise. I was a little frustrated with how unclear it was what I needed to do to unlock the others, though. Even trying to speedrun through a second time and do things a bit differently (you can get to the end in a handful of hours if you know where to go and really haul ass), I ended up with the same result. It seems like it would take a very thorough combing of the environment to get a different ending.If you take your time there are collectible items like photos of the witch\u2019s previous victims and military dog tags scattered across the map, but nothing to indicate how many you have left to collect or when you\u2019re \u201cdone\u201d with an area. I\u2019m not even sure if the photos have anything to do with which ending you get, honestly \u2013 that\u2019s just my best guess right now. Especially since the levels are so large, disorienting, and sometimes don\u2019t even follow sensible laws of physics, it seems like it would take a very thorough combing of the environment to get a different ending. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have the patience or the stomach to do so without a guide. Stuck In A Moment The other non-supernatural hazard I ran into more than once was getting stuck on the terrain. At least three times in my first playthrough I became so stuck that I had to reload an earlier save to free myself. This was usually more annoying than scary, though at one point it happened while something in the woods was trying to kill me and created an unintentionally heart-wrenching experience. Bullet can also occasionally get stuck, but he seems to at least have some magical way to teleport out of it that I wish he\u2019d been willing to share with me. Come on, boy. Why you holding out on me like that? There is also sort of a combat system, but it\u2019s hard to even talk about it without spoiling some of the better surprises. Suffice to say that Blair Witch differentiates itself from other horror games in that you\u2019ll almost never be running from anything. Every enemy requires either tense confrontation or teeth-clenching stealth to get past. There\u2019s even a segment that borrows the night vision camcorder mechanic we saw in Outlast, but I\u2019d say Blair Witch actually does it much better. There were a couple segments that felt like they relied a bit too much on cheap jump scares, or where things went from spooky to straight-up psychedelic in a way that harshed my horror buzz, but that was the exception rather than the rule. All the while, the sound design and music are expertly poised to enhance the tension and terror around every turn. If you\u2019re an aficionado of this type of game, you probably already know that they\u2019re meant to be played in as dark a room as possible with some good, around-ear headphones to get the most out of what\u2019s been carefully arranged to creep you out. Menacing whispers, the crunch of dry branches, foreboding basso melodies, and the reassuring panting that reminds you Bullet is nearby each served to transport me into the witch\u2019s dread domain."

Even though the combat is a bit weak and the controls can be frustrating at times, it manages to be both a great construction game and an engrossing, full-fledged RPG with tons of memorable areas and characters.  I never played the first Dragon Quest Builders , and I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to in order to get what was going on in this sequel. There are tons of references back to the Dragon Quest series that come across as nice touches if you catch them \u2013 familiar enemies, some returning locations and bosses, and nostalgic victory music. Even the minimap looks like an old school Dragon Quest overworld. And, well, if you don\u2019t already know why it\u2019s a big deal that your main ally\u2019s name is Malroth, I encourage you not to look it up so you don\u2019t spoil anything for yourself.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask  The biggest surprise for me was that Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a proper RPG with leveling, gear, magic items, dungeons, and boss fights. Rather than settling for dumping a bunch of Dragon Quest decorations into a Minecraft clone, what Omega Force and Square Enix have given us is more like a main-series-worthy JRPG with the exploration and crafting elements added as a bonus on top. I never felt that compromises were made on the elements of one to fit in elements of the other, which is quite an accomplishment.  I never felt compromises were made on the elements of one genre to fit in elements of the other. \u201c  When you\u2019re not putting together saloons, throne rooms, and wheat fields, you\u2019ll find yourself journeying above and below striking vistas to defeat monsters, retrieve magic items, and recruit new allies. There\u2019s an especially cool section that takes place in a huge, underground temple complex with puzzles, traps, and some tricky platforming. All along the way to each of these, you\u2019ll come across optional quests, hidden caches of loot, and shrine puzzles that can be solved to unlock rare items.  Bore-tal Combat  The one fairly weak aspect is combat, and it\u2019s unfortunate that such an important pillar is crumbling when so much else works so well. It\u2019s a real-time hack-and-slash system that lacks a block, dodge, or even strafe button. On easier enemies, I usually just wailed on them toe-to-toe and absorbed the hits. Bigger bosses with special attacks can only be avoided by sprinting forward past them and running around in clumsy circles until their animation finishes. Your character\u2019s main special attack takes so long to charge up that it does less damage per second than just button mashing, so I almost never used it. 82 Images  Some of the boss fights do have fun, unique mechanics. And there are some very cool field battles where you fight dozens of monsters alongside a personal army of NPCs. Those were entertaining in a chaotic, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on but this is pretty cool,\u201d kind of way. It\u2019s not completely unenjoyable to play, but I never felt my skills were really being tested in an interesting way.  Put together, the three main islands make up one of my favorite RPG worlds to explore in a long time. \u201c  Luckily, the construction and exploration pillars go a long way toward making up for this. While it can be nice to be dropped into a game like Minecraft to build whatever you can imagine with no restrictions, Dragon Quest Builders 2 encourages you to take fallow fields, a dried-up mining town, or a ruined city and build them up with specific structures and services into something that looks like a real, functional, lived-in settlement. I felt like I still had the freedom to make these places my own, but the objectives I had to meet were fuel for my creativity, like a good writing prompt. And seeing a vibrant community come together over time is a much more rewarding progression mechanism than anything involving stats or gear, especially when it comes to the wondrous great projects that serve as the capstones to each area.  Apple of My Isle  The overall story and dialogue are fairly simplistic, and at times seem geared toward a very young audience to their detriment. But it gets pretty exciting with some dramatic crescendos and sizzling intrigue toward the end. The three main islands you visit build toward this, and each has a very unique look, personality, and backstory to sink your teeth into. From the blighted grasslands of Furrowfield to the parched, Old West-inspired Khrumbul-Dun, you\u2019ll find a variety of challenges, new and charming NPCs to join your growing throng, and tons of varied, dramatic landscapes to explore. Each one feels lovingly crafted, and put together they make up one of my favorite RPG worlds to explore in a long time.  I did wish that exploration were a bit less fiddly, though. The controls on PS4, even aside from the frustrating combat I mentioned earlier, just don\u2019t feel particularly intuitive or well-thought-out. My ongoing nemesis was not any of the servants of the evil Hargon, but the fact that the button to switch tools is the same one used for Speak and Activate, so if a party member stepped in front of me while I was trying to get my hammer out, I might have to hear about their day for the 30th time before I could continue. There are some options available for remapping the controls, but they\u2019re very limited. Offering full button mapping would have been great, especially since L1 and L2 essentially do nothing useful."

        "Content": "The thriving subgenre of \u201cMetroidvania\u201d games exists to try to recreate the magic of classic Metroid and Castlevania games -- because original developers Nintendo and Konami dropped the idea long ago. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night achieves this goal better than most because it plays and feels almost exactly like the legendary Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It should, considering that was the whole pitch of the Kickstarter back in 2015, and that the team behind it is led by Symphony\u2019s assistant director, Koji \u201cIga\u201d Igarashi. Granted, not all attempts at crowdfunded spiritual successors to beloved games end up successful (looking at you, Mighty No. 9) but the stars have aligned for Bloodstained. Ritual of the Night has emerged as a game worthy of its heritage.  The number of Castlevania games Iga has been part of stretches into the double digits, but he couldn\u2019t just bring Dracula back again and throw another Belmont into a castle this time. While the gameplay is familiar, an interesting new world with its own heroes, villains, and stakes (not the vampire-killing kind) has been created, and every aspect of it seems to be designed specifically to support the mechanics of this type of game. You play as Miriam, an orphan girl with the ability to absorb and wield a ridiculous number of demon powers. A lot of care was put into Miriam\u2019s design, and she\u2019s cosmetically customizable as well \u2013 it\u2019s a shame that the supporting cast did not receive the same TLC as our heroine and are all pretty ugly.   Bloodstained plays and feels almost exactly like the legendary Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. \u201c As luck would have it, this evil castle just popped up and it\u2019s filled with demons! So, in you go to methodically expose the enormous castle map, fight cool monsters, gain experience, and craft increasingly powerful weapons with all the bizarre loot you find. (Why was that demon dog carrying curry powder?) We\u2019ve done this a dozen times in Castlevanias, but not since Symphony have we been able to do it with the power and real estate of a home console and a television.   It\u2019s clear Iga and his team put as much content as they could into Bloodstained to make sure their return to the genre was a triumphant one. My adventure took about 20 hours to track down the real ending, which is quite a bit longer than the 12-or-so hours you might spend with Symphony. Even after all of that, I\u2019m excited to get back to it because exploring the castle is so much fun and I still have two percent of the map to uncover and more demon powers to unlock.  There are some expected (double jump) and unexpected movement abilities to find that really let you master the terrain. The locations gradually expand from typical haunted castle areas like cathedrals and secret labs to some surprising environments you wouldn\u2019t normally expect to find, um, indoors. There are also darkly beautiful sights in the castle that showcase impressive lighting effects and moonlit vistas. Even the save rooms and fast-travel locations look great.   The enormous wealth of powers and weapons to find means there is a lot of room to customize your own play style. I had a lot of success with a good one-handed sword and a passive ability that increases its damage combined with a shield of portraits that float around my body (think the leaf shield from Mega Man 2), an arrow attack for when I needed to take out an enemy at range, and a familiar I could summon that can point out destructible walls hiding secrets. But if you\u2019re more comfortable with slower, more powerful weapons, guns, or kung fu, there are options for you to hack, shoot, or kick your way through the castle.  I found 79 demon powers (63 percent) in my playthrough, and just over 50 percent of the discoverable items. So there\u2019s a lot out there! The randomness of loot drops means it\u2019s not always straightforward getting the tools you want, but Bloodstained never feels like too much of a chore because simply running around slashing monsters is fun. Of course, that randomness is one of the key features that separates these \u201cIgavanias\u201d from similar games.  The monsters are some of the best parts of Bloodstained. \u201c Despite the fluid and satisfying combat that feels lifted directly out of the classic games, a few fights \u2013 especially one late-game boss battle \u2013 produced some slowdown even on a PlayStation 4 Pro, and there were a couple of crashes when I was attempting to read a tome. There can also be a slight delay when bringing up the pause menu for some reason.  The monsters are some of the best parts of Bloodstained. From giant cats with demon horns to horses that can swim underwater to shredding guitar players, there is always something fun to kill while exploring the castle. Some of the bosses will be familiar to people who played the 8-bit prequel game, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon last year. Having played that spinoff, it was pretty cool seeing those characters return as gigantic 3D models.  39 Images  All characters are capably voice acted, and they even got Solid Snake himself, David Hayter, to voice a significant role. Both English and Japanese voice tracks are included, something I always appreciate for Japanese-made games.  The soundtrack was composed by Castlevania veteran Michiru Yamane and Mega Man veteran Ippo Yamada. It\u2019s a very nice score that evokes classic Castlevania adventures, but I don\u2019t think it matches the mastery of Symphony of the Night. I\u2019m still humming that game\u2019s tunes 22 years later, and I don\u2019t see Bloodstained\u2019s music sticking with me the same way.  Note that the Switch version is currently experiencing major performance issues and 505 Games has issued a statement that it is shifting focus to address them."

        "Content": "Insurgency: Sandstorm is an excellent multiplayer shooter that successfully avoids the common pitfalls of military simulation, but still manages to deliver an immersive, at times disturbing, sense of realism to its modern, Middle Eastern setting. Its arsenal consists of some of the best-realized firearms in any video game to date thanks to stellar sound design, punchy animations, and obsessive attention to detail. Elsewhere, though, things aren't quite as glamorous: I found most of its maps to fall into the \u201cjust okay\u201d category due in part to poorly defined restricted areas that, on top of being annoying to encounter, are easily exploited. Still, Insurgency: Sandstorm punches well above its weight, offering phenomenal gunplay that shows up much of its big-budget competition.  If ever there was an example of outstanding FPS gunplay, Insurgency: Sandstorm is surely it. That surprisingly elusive feeling isn\u2019t a result of any one factor but rather a marriage of several. To boil it down: pronounced but manageable recoil, a near-instantaneous time to kill, percussive sound, impactful graphics, and an obsessive understanding of firearms come together to make SMGs, LMGs, shotguns, and especially assault rifles feel truly special.   And while Sandstorm has ample amounts of all of the aforementioned qualities, it leans hard into its knowledge of how guns actually work. Upon chambering a round at the start of a match, you can then swap magazines to effectively increase your capacity by one. Tiny details like the depression of the magazine release or the change in position of the fire selection switch are all visible on the gun models and are thoroughly appreciated. You can double tap the reload button to perform a hasty magazine swap that, while faster, discards any remaining ammunition in the spent magazine. Shotguns have remarkable range by FPS standards. And finally, there is slight deadzone in the middle of your aiming axis where only the gun moves and your character does not. That sounds weird but feels great. These details may seem trivial but the results are anything but.  The effect that all this realistic weaponry has on the battlefield is downright scary. \u201c The effect that all this realistic weaponry has on the battlefield is downright scary. If you\u2019re looking to walk away from your modern military FPS with mild tinnitus then Sandstorm on a pair quality headphones is a good place to start. Bullets produce a loud snap when whizzing by, and a burst of automatic gunfire against a nearby metal surface is almost deafening. I\u2019ve never been in combat, but this seems to be a much more realistic representation than we typically see in games. The most disturbing sounds, though, come in the form of determined, blood-spewing coughs and the labored, wailing death rattles produced by both your enemies and allies. These touches are intense, and I wouldn\u2019t blame if you find them to be in poor taste. But I, for one, prefer a depiction of war that doesn\u2019t obscure its horrific nature. The feeling of being in the thick of it is enhanced by myriad post-processing and particle effects that successfully punch up Sandstorm\u2019s otherwise-modest looks.  This brutal, at times tragic depiction of war certainly makes an impact at first. And while such scenes eventually become secondary to the fixation on gameplay, a few particularly unsettling scenarios managed to evoke an audible \u201coof\u201d from me, even well after the 30-hour mark. And while its commitment to realism is apparent throughout, Insurgency: Sandstorm also knows when gameplay should come first. For instance, even in the absence of enemy hit indicators I was rarely left pondering an enemy\u2019s fate thanks to the impressively large and (hopefully) exaggerated mist of blood that landing a shot produces. Other compromises are even less subtle, like HUD elements that display the position of allies through walls. Kicking in a door has the effect in instantly killing anyone on the other side, and you can even jump on a grenade to reduce or prevent the damage dealt to nearby allies. While some of these examples may have a real-world analog, they feel to me like solid choices that were made for the sake of better gameplay, and I appreciate them.  While its commitment to realism is apparent throughout, Insurgency: Sandstorm also knows when gameplay should come first. \u201c The non-competitive versus playlist contains two modes that support up to 32 players: Push, Skirmish, and Firefight which supports up to 12. All three are enjoyable in their own right and offer sufficiently unique experiences, but Firefight stands well above the rest. The objective is deceptively simple: kill everyone on the other team or take all three uncontested capture points, whichever comes first. The catch is that because dead players can only respawn if their team takes an objective, the ensuing high-stakes strategy makes each match enjoyable and replayable. The tension is similar to that felt in Counter-Strike\u2019s Bomb Defusal or Hostage Rescue, but with the chance for redemption after death. The six maps are at their best in this small-scale setting, but even here the unintuitive boundaries managed to frustrate me ever so often.  Artificially imposed \u201crestricted areas\u201d announce their presence with bright-red on-screen text and an angry AI callout when you step over their invisible borders. The problem is that there is usually no visual language in either the map design or HUD that distinguishes where these boundaries are, and many can simply be ignored to unfairly access a legal area. This makes learning the ins and outs of where you can and cannot go in a particular portion of a particular map on a particular mode total guesswork. And to really drive the ambiguity home, trespassing in different restricted areas result in different punishments. For instance, going straight out of bounds prompts a timer that will kill you if you remain, staying in an in-bounds restricted area for too long disables your weapon, but ducking into a restricted zone for only a few seconds carries no perceptible punishment. This means that in many cases these boundaries serves no functional purpose other than to confuse everybody.  It just feels sloppy to have so many restricted areas so close to the objectives. \u201c For instance, you can simply bulldoze through restricted areas at multiple points on Precinct in the Push mode to flank enemies from an unexpected angle. Conversely, if you think you\u2019re safe because your flank is blocked by territory that\u2019s restricted to the enemy team, you\u2019re probably not. Furthermore, it just feels sloppy to have so many restricted areas so close to the objectives themselves. And finally, these boundaries accentuate Precinct and Refinery\u2019s worst characteristics - their linear and narrow design. Elsewhere, Crossing is barren to a fault, Hideout opens with a nightmare of a chokepoint on Security Push, and fighting through the densest parts of Summit took a toll on my performance. On the whole, the maps betray Insurgency: Sandstorm\u2019s humble origins more than any other element when compared to its big-budget kin.  I\u2019ve seen a few minor bugs, but most are of the graphical and hopefully easy-to-fix variety. I can only think of three larger issues worthy of bringing up: there is no way to disable the hysteria-inducing mic chirp noises of allied players even if you mute them, initiating a vault over an obstacle can be noticeably finicky, and on two occasions my gun inexplicably refused to fire for a few seconds\u2026 and yes, it was loaded. Some players have complained about a low framerate, but my experience on both a GeForce 2080 TI and 1070 I\u2019ve only seen minor performance issues on the Summit map.  Maintaining a level playing field while also rewarding time invested means that progression in Insurgency: Sandstorm is purely aesthetic in nature. Each of the 33 firearms and the dozen or so attachments are unlocked from the very get-go, with the only limiting factors being your class, faction, and loadout points. The Breacher class, for example, has different primary weapon choices than the Gunner, but each has the same amount of points to customize their guns and gear as they see fit. Tinkering with point distribution proved to be a fun process of trial and error. If you want an absolutely decked out primary, for example, you can ax your explosives, armor, and secondary weapon and dump all of those points into attachments like a suppressor, foregrip, laser sight, and optic.   You may not always get to play as your favored class, though, because most roles have a limit on how many people are allowed to play them at a time. Playing as the Marksman, is a first-come, first-served endeavor. However, I was never particularly disappointed at the prospect of being forced into the plain-old Rifleman role, as that basic class offers fantastic versatility and has no problem competing with more specialized archetypes.  While most of the eight classes simply offer exclusive weaponry, the Observer and Commander are clear outliers. A Commander can call in powerful ordnance like chemical mortars, drone bombers, or a helicopter gunship \u2013 but only if the radio-operating Observer is standing close by. Crucially, all members of this fire support team need to be alive to get anything done.  When you\u2019ve cut your teeth on the versus playlist you can up the stakes in a ranked competitive queue. Here a lengthier version of Firefight with five players on each team serves as the only mode and weapons, attachments, and equipment are all much more expensive, resulting in the use of barebones loadouts. Communication is key, and comms remain active even after you\u2019ve died. While my experience in ranked is limited I love what I\u2019ve played so far \u2013 the competitive playlist makes Sandstorm\u2019s best mode even better. With that said, I think the inclusion of seasonal ranked rewards would be a welcome incentive to increase the apparently barren matchmaking pool. Finally, there is a tutorial and cooperative versus AI mode if you need a bit of practice before heading into multiplayer."

Coming face to face with the undead shadows of the great pharaohs is both a fun fight and an interesting depiction of Egyptian myth that\u2019s rarely been seen. Encounters like these make this DLC difficult to put down. (If you missed it, check out our Assassin's Creed Origins review .) Curse of the Pharaohs has all the things that make an Assassin's Creed game great: a story with themes relevant to the time period, combat that\u2019s both challenging and fun, and a stunning historical setting that ties it all together. In this adventure, Bayek travels south of Siwa to the bustling city of Thebes, which is a hub for trade and beautiful monuments. It\u2019s conveniently nestled along the Nile river across the water from the Valley of the Kings, and home to the temples of Karnak and Luxor. These temples are the city\u2019s biggest landmarks, featuring lush gardens, lotus blossom ponds, and ornate architecture that make Thebes a place that\u2019s full of opportunities to explore.  It\u2019s here that Curse of the Pharaohs takes a giant leap of faith into ancient Egyptian mysticism. When the spirits of the pharaohs are angered by the theft of their artifacts and return from the afterlife to wreak havoc on Thebes\u2019 citizens, it\u2019s a big change of pace from the more grounded story of Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins and The Hidden Ones DLC . But this isn\u2019t just another story of scorned mummies rising from the dead \u2013 you get to play an important part in their journey through the afterlife, and it\u2019s a well-done story that\u2019s filled with symbolism. There\u2019s plenty of attention to detail, giving every indication that care was taken when touching on these topics. The atmosphere of each underworld is vastly different from the next. \u201c Some of the most memorable moments of Curse of the Pharaohs come while exploring the mystical afterlife worlds of the pharaohs. The atmosphere of each underworld Bayek visits is vastly different from the next, reflecting the life of the king or queen it represents. You find Nefertiti in Aaru, known by the ancient Egyptians as a beautiful paradise where the spirits of those who lived a balanced life would rest. It\u2019s filled with beautiful fields of reeds, flowers, and wine. Tutankhamun, by contrast, is found in Duat: a dark and dangerous place, similar to the Christian concept of purgatory, where spirits go to be judged. These worlds are nothing short of surreal, crawling with giant scorpions, jackal-headed mercenaries, human-headed birds, and other oddities from Egyptian lore that set them well apart from everything else in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins. One quest that stands out as particularly memorable is The Heretic, in which Bayek pays a visit to the afterlife of Akhenaten in a giant temple surrounded by water and beautiful greenery. In the sky is a giant shining orb that resembles the sun, and it seemed strange that someone dubbed The Heretic would spend the rest of his eternal life in a place so beautiful. Without spoiling anything, it wasn\u2019t long before I was captivated by his tale and spent hours reading up on Egyptian spirituality, Akhenaten, and his weird affinity for the sun. This homework isn\u2019t at all necessary, since the story that eventually unfolds here makes sense on its own, but it\u2019s an instance where Curse of the Pharaohs did more than just entertain me with pretty scenery and awesome fights.  That said, the progression of some of the main quests isn\u2019t as smooth as it is elsewhere in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins. Instead of adding new objectives to the main quest, they show up as entirely different quests instead, which gets to be confusing when you\u2019re jumping from one main quest to another and trying to complete them in the order that\u2019s required. It\u2019s a strange issue, seeing as this was executed much better with The Hidden Ones DLC. There\u2019s definitely plenty of opportunity for challenge in combat. \u201c Jumping into Pharaoh\u2019s Curse at level 45 was a good starting point that let me comfortably complete all of the main quests in around 10 to 12 hours, with no tedious grinding required. There\u2019s definitely plenty of opportunity for challenge in combat, though, including a new enemy type called the Pharaoh\u2019s Shadow. Similar in style to the Shadows of Scarab and Phylakes, the Pharaoh\u2019s Shadows are tough adversaries who appear at random around Thebes, taking the lives of innocent bystanders before disappearing again. Chasing the Shadows down is occasionally tiresome, especially if you\u2019ve run halfway across the map only for them to disappear as soon as you arrive. Despite that, it\u2019s a good opportunity to hone your skills before taking on the pharaohs themselves in the afterlife. The strong differentiation between the weapons and fighting styles of the pharaohs adds a nice layer of variety. Nefertiti\u2019s dual swords and quick-paced fighting style doesn\u2019t leave much room for ranged attacks, while Ramesses\u2019 heavy blunt attack is slow and more predictable, giving way to a fight that\u2019s more dynamic. These enemies have some pretty lethal combos, and if you\u2019re not careful to avoid them you\u2019re sure to find yourself staring at the desynchronization screen. Dodging and waiting for the perfect time to strike will get you far, but requires some patience. Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review 36 Images  When you defeat a pharaoh in the afterlife, you\u2019re rewarded with their weapon. This comes in the form of four high-level legendaries that include a dual sword, sickle sword, heavy blunt, and spear \u2013 and oh boy, are these legendary weapons ever worth the trouble. Speaking of trouble, I encountered more technical issues in Curse of the Pharaohs than average, including a full crash back to the PS4 dashboard. There\u2019s also the occasional buggy climbing mishap where Bayek gets stuck inside objects and his only escape is reloading your last save. But they weren\u2019t frequent enough to be more than an inconvenience on this fantastical ride through Egyptian mythology."

        "Content": "As it turns out, Aloy had it too easy in Horizon Zero Dawn, and The Frozen Wilds is proof of it. This major expansion is a wonderfully challenging 15-hour adventure that\u2019s peppered with creative side quests, a thoughtful story, and the best battles Aloy\u2019s seen to date. Its story integrates with the main game and can be played after finishing the main quest, so it works both for completionists and those who never quite finished the story quests. You can travel to a new, gorgeous area on the existing map as soon as you install it (even if how to start th e new questline isn't immediately apparent), though you\u2019d risk crossing the line between bravery and stupidity to attempt it before level 30. In this terrain, you\u2019ll explore the mysteries surrounding the nomadic Banuk tribe \u2013 mysteries which made for one of the most memorable side quests in Zero Dawn. The Frozen Wilds delves deeper into into the fascinating intricacies of their structure and spirituality. Specifically, it zooms in on the compelling idea of gods and demons as the explanation for the apocalyptic world full of dinosaur-like robots. Though its story occasionally veers into jargon-heavy convolution - speak English, people! - by the end I had been asked some genuinely thought-provoking questions on the place faith has in such a brutal world. For her part, Aloy remains an endearingly warm character. At this point in the story she\u2019s strong and skilled enough to pull rank when the situation demands it, and her personality fills that role nicely. She\u2019s also the voice of reason, and whenever The Frozen Wilds stumbles into silliness, Aloy is there to point it out with dry quips delivered with bite by voice actress Ashly Burch. She\u2019s well matched by a new supporting cast, the most interesting and eccentric of whom appear in the many side quests peppered throughout the expansion. These adventures are some of the best we\u2019ve seen yet, with a particular focus on Uncharted/Tomb Raider-style platforming as you climb up ominously vertical playgrounds, breathless battles, and hilarious banter. Killer Instinct They\u2019re worth it on a practical level, too, as you\u2019ll want to keep levelling up (if you\u2019re not level 50 already) to get stronger weapons and materials. Though mostly familiar from Zero Dawn, the monsters that roam The Frozen Wilds are not playing around; if you\u2019re ganged up on, expect to have an extremely tough fight on your hands. Developer Guerilla has justified this major stat boost by means of a \u2018daemonic\u2019 force that has infiltrated the robots\u2019 systems, so fighting a \u2018daemonic thunderjaw\u2019 is going to be a much more frightening proposition than fighting its regular counterpart. It\u2019s just as large and imposing, but deadly enough to restore the fear that\u2019d been lost. These battles are the most fun I\u2019ve had in Horizon to date. Between levels 40 and 50 in Zero Dawn I\u2019d found myself fighting complacently, especially equipped with the Shield Weaver armour that gives Aloy a regenerating shield, but The Frozen Wilds brought back the sense of danger. Even fully upgraded, I found fighting groups of Daemonic machines overwhelming (the only reason I didn\u2019t repeatedly die was the absurd number of health potions and metal shards I\u2019d collected during my 40 hours with Zero Dawn), and a handful of completely new machines that primarily serve as bosses of sorts tested my \u201croll at the very last second\u201d twitch reflexes to their limits. I loved feeling like I was genuinely fighting for my life, even with my skill tree maxed out. To make fights more frantic, The Frozen Wilds also introduces Control Towers, which are spindly, tentacular machines that blast out a purple pulse of energy that lowers your shield resistance and heals hostile machines in the vicinity. Overriding or destroying these towers takes concentration and time, resulting in nail-biting tension as you try to take them down before the machines tear you apart. This all lends a real sense of danger while moving across the world. If Zero Dawn was like playing in Jurassic Park, The Frozen Wilds is like playing through The Lost World: it\u2019s untamed and unregulated. Because even a Daemonic Watcher now proves as much of a threat as it did in the first few hours of the campaign, I was frequently spooked by rustling sounds in the bushes, or approaching roars, particularly while playing during one of its eerie night cycles. Let it Snow It helps that The Frozen Wild\u2019s far-north terrain is dauntingly beautiful. Its snow-blanketed mountains, ravines, and fields are peppered with day-glo lakes and framed by gorgeous blue-red sunsets. It may sound like a small thing, but considering how much time you\u2019ll spend in it if you play to the end, the it\u2019s important that the Frozen Wild\u2019s snow feels crunchy and real. When Aloy comments on how cold it is, I could feel it. The Frozen Wild\u2019s other major point of difference from Zero Dawn is the addition of a new branch to Aloy\u2019s skill tree, referred to as \u2018The Traveller.\u2019  With a focus on ease of movement while mounted on an overridden machine and making the most of your inventory, The Traveller doesn\u2019t feel vital to the expansion itself, but rather to the longevity of Horizon as a whole. Being able to pick up resources while on the back of a broadhead or learning to disassemble resources and mods into 50% of their metal shard values feel like no-brainer ideas, and I\u2019m glad Guerrilla finally included them.

        "Content": "You know how a joke can start funny, get annoying, then become funny again through sheer attrition? That\u2019s Cuphead\u2019s approach to enjoyment. With a beautiful, caustic, near-unceasing stream of boss battles, Studio MDHR\u2019s debut made me scream with joy and horror by turn, but I settled on joy by the end. The most obvious point to begin with is that Cuphead looks astonishing. Its 1930s animation style \u2013 all watercolour backgrounds and surreal, juddering, hand-drawn characters \u2013 pay peerless homage to Max Fleischer and his ilk, and are perfectly implemented. Somehow it manages to balance dozens of moving elements and a slight rear-projection blur without ever feeling unreadable in even the most frantic moments. There has never been a game that looks like this and there may never be again. Every scene is a masterwork \u2013 it\u2019s a near-unbelievable achievement for an art style. The sound work is an ideal match: a huge jumble of high-tempo ragtime, swing, big band, and jazz (the list of musicians is almost as long as the rest of the credits combined) pummels away wonderfully in the background of every fight. It makes Cuphead feel truly out of time, and its bizarre mix of \u201830s aesthetics and \u201880s design more heady than ever. I also feel duty-bound to point out that the way Porkrind the shopkeeper bellows \u201cwelcome\u201d made me laugh every single time I heard it. There\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s gorgeous, and many people will be drawn to that, but that veneer conceals a very niche, hardcore design. You may have gleaned by now that this game is really, really hard. It\u2019s absolutely uncompromising in its difficulty from the outset. No level includes checkpoints and, barring one late-game match-up, there is no way to regain lost health. You could hit levels that take hours to beat, and the finale is locked off until you beat every other level on \u201cRegular\u201d difficulty (i.e. extremely difficult). And don\u2019t think that local co-op will ease things up \u2013 dropping in a second player as Cuphead\u2019s pal Mugman makes events onscreen that much harder to follow. I find it actively harder with a second player, if anything. And so, as I played I gradually stopped noticing a lot of the glorious art, because actually interacting with Cuphead is so hectic, so stressful, that it just gets filed away by my right-brain as a distraction. That skyscraper-tall robot firing laser barriers is just three hovering hitboxes and a series of no-go zones. When one boxing glove-wearing frog eats another to turn itself into an evil slot machine, that\u2019s nothing more than a phase change. My favourite boss design \u2013 a giant bird wearing cuckoo clock armour and its tiny, ray gun-wielding chick \u2013 fires wads of garbage at you by literally turning its head into a bin, but I only noticed that detail when I watched someone else play it hours later. Cuphead's Story In (Beautiful) Pictures 12 Images In the moment it\u2019s frenetic, but Cuphead\u2019s structure is a linear sequence of three worlds filled with one-shot levels to complete, and a finale. Those levels can take one of three forms. The least common \u2013 and least interesting \u2013 is run \u2018n\u2019 gun, left-to-right platforming drawn directly from the likes of Contra. Barring one that has you regularly flipping gravity to get through, these are both the easiest and least inventive stages that Cuphead has to offer. They\u2019re meant to provide some breathing space from endless boss battles, but they end up feeling more like a lull. Thankfully, the other types are straight boss battles, and they are an entirely different sentient kettle of surreal, singing fish. Some take the form of bullet hell shooting, with Cuphead mounted in a free-flying plane. As much tests of dexterity as they are pattern learning, they\u2019re a throwback to the likes of classic Treasure games (just with fewer spaceships and more angry constellations), and slot comfortably alongside them for quality. Best of all, though, are the platforming battles. This is where MDHR flexes its imagination most, crafting weird, often hilarious bouts that have you interacting with the limited control scheme in more and more interesting ways. Taking on the workers on a ghost train has you not only shooting enemies, but also controlling the position of your rail trolley platform while stopping minions from moving you into dangerous positions. Battling an actress in her theatre takes you through the different stages of a play, and the combat feels almost like a fighting game as she divekicks and uses props as special moves. One of the final levels changes the structure entirely, turning a series of fights into a miniature board game \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute joy, and up there with the best boss battles I\u2019ve ever played. Perhaps Cuphead\u2019s smartest, most devilish addition is in how all these types of levels taunt you into playing more. No enemy has a health bar, nor an indication for when you\u2019re getting close to a knockout \u2013 instead, when you die you\u2019re shown a graph of how close you were to the KO or the next phase of the battle. It reduces screen clutter while also encouraging (or perhaps that should be \u201cberating\u201d) you into taking another crack at it. It\u2019s not just a matter of playing the same way over and over, however. Unlockable shot types, extra abilities, and a series of super moves offer you different solutions to difficult levels. Some are more useful than others \u2013 I only used the shot that fires backwards in a single fight, and I genuinely can\u2019t imagine playing without the ability that prevents you from taking damage during a dash \u2013 but they offer a splash of puzzle thinking to the mix. It can be vital to experiment with them, too; I only managed to beat the final boss because of a change in ammunition. Cuphead himself is perfectly responsive and, with never-ending shots and dashes at his disposal, genuinely powerful when compared to other platforming heroes. It just so happens that he\u2019s being pitted against extremely tough opposition. The controls are good enough to make mistakes feel like your fault, not his. The one real issue with Cuphead\u2019s abilities is the parry system. You can double-jump off of any object coloured pink, but will take damage if you get the timing wrong. Unfortunately, it feels flimsily implemented \u2013 sometimes very generous, sometimes requiring absolute precision. Even having finished the campaign, I still don\u2019t feel like I have a true handle on it. There are a few curious design choices that make Cuphead harder in a way that\u2019s less rewarding. The default gamepad control scheme, for instance, maps Cuphead\u2019s shoot and jump abilities to adjacent face buttons, making them far harder to press at the same time than they ever should be. It\u2019s an absurd choice for two actions you\u2019ll be using constantly \u2013 make sure you remap one to a trigger before you begin. Having to leave a fight entirely to change your ability loadout is also an unnecessary waste of time, and it stands out starkly because every other element of Cuphead is geared towards you getting to retry a failed bout almost instantly. But Cuphead\u2019s use of randomisation between different runs of the same battle is perhaps its worst decision. On the one hand, the fact that some bosses can spawn sets of randomised mini-bosses is legitimately exciting (not to mention a chance to cram in even more of MDHR\u2019s animation), and changes to attack patterns keep things fresh and challenging even after tens of retries. It\u2019s pushed too far, however. Certain combinations of attacks can feel legitimately unfair \u2013 being pushed to the edge of the screen, only to have exploding projectiles spawn offscreen behind you, for example \u2013 but, it must be said, most can be dealt with. Similarly, winning a long-fought battle simply because randomisation made one run much easier than the ones that came before can make your triumph feel a little limp. Worst of all, scrolling levels with randomly placed platforms can become all but impossible through no fault of your own. It is a shame that certain levels feel less like skill tests and more like luck of the draw, but that\u2019s thankfully a rare problem. One of Cuphead\u2019s greatest strengths is that no matter how long a boss takes to beat, I usually emerged feeling like a better player for the experience, and ready to bring that to the next fight."

The main difference, obviously, is that the Switch version can be taken on the road, which is nice. The same applies for PS4 owners with a Vita, mind you, thanks to cross-play functionality.]  In the cluttered landscape of fictional post-apocalyptic worlds, 2013\u2019s SteamWorld Dig was a breath of fresh air. A steampunk Western, it sends you digging deep into the earth, searching out precious resources to sell in the dusty, one-mechanical horse town above. It\u2019s a glorious a tale of robot cowboys, mutant humans and mysterious technology. SteamWorld Dig 2 is very much the sequel I was hoping for. It has the same core gameplay loop of digging for riches, but leans further into platforming, puzzle solving and RPG elements, while boasting a gorgeously detailed aesthetic.  In contrast to its predecessor, SteamWorld Dig 2\u2019s world is not procedurally generated, and you can feel the handcrafted quality as a result. Dungeon layouts take devious pride in enemy positioning and cleverly hidden secrets. You\u2019ll also come across cave entrances that take you to an impressive variety of self-contained challenges. These rooms make for a nice change of pace, as you go from literally carving out your own path through a massive sprawling world to being in a confined space with very specific solutions. These puzzles and platforming gauntlets aren\u2019t difficult, but they\u2019re satisfying, and net you cogs and artifacts \u2013 two of the most important collectables in Dig 2.   Dig 2\u2019s protagonist, Dorothy, doesn\u2019t have much to work with from a story perspective. But much more importantly, she\u2019s wonderfully nimble, and even the simple act of wall jumping to quickly ascend mine shafts feels great. New abilities unlock steadily, giving Dorothy more and more versatility. It\u2019s not long before you\u2019re shooting sticky bombs, pounding through previously unbreakable rocks with a jackhammer, and using a hookshot to grapple your way around the mines. And it doesn't stop there.  Everything you use can be levelled up, too, allowing you to mine faster, shoot further and expand your backpack. This provides a constant sense of progress, and feeds into the compulsion to harvest and cash-in resources for gold. Each upgrade you purchase or blueprint you acquire then unlocks a new cog mod. These are perks that are powered by the upgrade cogs hidden around the world and sit atop your core abilities, allowing you to spec (and re-spec \u2013 nothing is locked in) Dorothy to suit your play style. Like taking on enemies with your pickaxe? You should equip Hunter\u2019s Edge and Bounty Hunter, which give you extra XP and a cash reward for pickaxe kills, respectively. \u201c  Like taking on enemies with your pickaxe? You should equip Hunter\u2019s Edge and Bounty Hunter, which give you extra XP and a cash reward for pickaxe kills, respectively. You could also equip Healer, which adds a chance of netting a bonus health orb from enemies defeated using the pickaxe. And then later in the game you\u2019ll get Sharpened Edge, which deals extra damage with the pickaxe.  Then again, maybe you\u2019re all about the resources and want to carry more, find more and make harvested minerals and ores magically come to you, Ratchet & Clank-style. There are mods for all those. There\u2019s even a mod to highlight all the resource tiles on the mini-map. And one to make hidden areas easier to find. And one that means you\u2019ll lose less resources if you die.  There\u2019s a wealth of options, in other words, and the possibilities ramp up as you progress. This system really rewards players who are as thorough as possible, too. I loved systematically pillaging everything on the map; creating a maze of tunnels as I mined every resource tile, found every secret, and beat every puzzle. Plus, the more XP you earn, the higher Dorothy\u2019s level, which then gives you a percentage bonus whenever you sell resources back in town.  SteamWorld Dig 2 Screenshots 13 Images  Dig 2 is all about the explore, harvest, upgrade, explore loop. Like the last game it has a risk-reward dynamic at play, as you need to come back to the surface to sell off your loot regularly \u2013 your backpack can only carry so much \u2013 but how often you do that is about how far you want to push it. The longer you stay underground the dimmer your lamp gets, and the more you collect the greater the loss if you die. It gets easier as you progress, however, as you can equip cogs to help keep your lamp glowing and unlock more ways to safely take out enemies. Dig 2 throws some great curveballs at you, whether that\u2019s being pursued by hulking robots in a techno fever dream, or carefully navigating an acid swamp... \u201c  The fast-travel system also makes your health less important than it might be, as getting to a pneumatic tube entrance lets you hop back to town, instantly replenishing your health, water stores, and lamp. Thanks to that lifeline, I probably only died around a dozen times across ten or so hours of play. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t tense times, of course. You\u2019re not always close to a fast-travel point, so if the light is growing dim and your health is low you often have a choice: press on and hope to find one, or bail out and try to survive the long journey back to the last tube. Dig 2 also throws some great curveballs at you, whether that\u2019s being pursued by hulking robots in a techno fever dream, or carefully navigating an acid swamp, where seemingly everything either explodes or melts the ground away. After you beat the final boss you\u2019re able to hop back into your last save to continue scavenging and levelling up, but the incentive to do so isn't explicit, as you need to collect all the artifacts - no easy task - to unlock the post-game content. I'd have loved something more immediate. The original encouraged multiple playthroughs thanks to its procedural world, and while I prefer the more curated, content rich approach taken here, a New Game + mode would have been amazing, or perhaps a separate set of standalone challenges to test your abilities with different loadouts in different scenarios. As it is, Dig 2 is mostly one-and-done, but it's great there's a reason to see it all the way through."

        "Content": "What Remains of Edith Finch sits alongside Kentucky Route Zero as one of the finest magical-realism stories in all of video games. A first-person, story-driven experience akin to Gone Home and Firewatch, it tells the incredible, tragic, and constantly surprising multi-generational history of the Finch family. As you explore the the gorgeous labyrinthine home, you\u2019ll go on a guided history of each family member, delve into what may or may not be a familial curse, and ultimately learn how each one succumbed to it. Developer Giant Sparrow (known for The Unfinished Swan) has once again created something truly special.  In the two hours it took me to fully explore I ran the emotional gamut from feeling completely devastated to full of an energetic light to annoyed by noticeable performance dips, especially when I approached the house for the first time. The only challenge is finding a way into each locked room of the house, generally through the use of secret passages that make the whole thing exude the charm and imagination of a pop-up book. While exploring the house, the last living member of the Finch family, Edith, narrates with stories of the house, her family, and how the incredible lives they lived untimely came to an end.   While the whole thing is pretty much devoid of any friction preventing you from progressing (there are even fewer puzzles here than in the aforementioned Gone Home), the joy of Edith Finch is in fully immersing yourself in the final moments of each Finch\u2019s life. Once you find a specific momento in each of their rooms, you\u2019re treated to a story of their death, told through fantastical allegories. Each one is presented through a completely different gameplay experience that continually subverted my expectations. With each one, nothing is safe when it comes to art style, perspective, or gameplay genre. I don\u2019t want to spoil them because I got so much joy out of never knowing where the next memory would take me. With the exception of one awkward sequence where you control animals from a first-person perspective, there\u2019s a dreamlike nature to the way these sequences not only bend the rules, but completely obliterate them.  While each story is ultimately about death, it\u2019s wonderful how full of life each and every tale is. Even something as heart-wrenching as the death of a child is presented with such exuberant creativity and magic. While experiencing the final moments of their lives is unquestionably tragic, they way they embrace it and welcome whatever might come next filled each story with light. The eccentric family themselves reminded me from The Tenenbaums from Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums, or the Glass family from J.D. Salinger\u2019s various works. Learning how they they were all related and how the various deaths impacted each surviving member is something that I won\u2019t soon forget.  One thing I absolutely love about the house itself is how incredibly lived-in in feels. It doesn\u2019t come across as a set designed around the idea of a video game level, but rather a home that a dozen members of an impossibly creative family lived in over several generations. Part of this comes at the cost of interactivity \u2013 there\u2019s very little in the house you can actually touch or manipulate. Like a museum, there\u2019s a \u201clook, but don\u2019t touch\u201d policy here. But honestly, this didn\u2019t bother me given how much I enjoyed the act of meticulously looking at every beautiful detail of the world.",

As a spiritual successor to 1999's Planescape: Torment, one of the finest (and strangest) RPGs ever made, Torment: Tides of Numenera embraces its predecessor's isometric design with its use of the capable Pillars of Eternity engine. More importantly, it preserves Planescape: Torment's weird philosophical tone and aesthetic, filling the screen with everything from quasi-medieval markets to entire cities crafted out of meat.  Sometimes, admittedly, it clings too much to fantasy trappings despite its setting of a billion years in the future, and its mages and ax-wielding warriors leave it feeling like a take on Baldur's Gate with aliens in the place of elves. Fortunately, it's an attractive vision.

It's a world where headless men arouse about as much curiosity as a 3D printer today, where neon-green monoliths zap the unprepared, and where pods packed with demigods sometimes plummet from the sky.

You\u2019re the \"Last Castoff,\" the empty shell of a being called The Changing God who creates new bodies for himself and then dumps them like used Coke bottles once he's ready to move on to another. Others exist like you, and each assumes his or her own consciousness after being tossed aside. Through it all, a horrific entity known as The Sorrow mysteriously hunts down every castoff, and your main goal is never much more serious than keeping it at bay.  Fortunately, you're not such a nobody that no one wants to hang out with you. Torment: Tides of Numenera features several companions who can tag along with The Last Castoff three at a time, and I sometimes found their stories as fascinating as my character\u2019s. Take the wise Callistege, who walks around surrounded by flickering clones of herself glimpsed from alternate realities. Or consider Erritis, a warrior whose unstable personality channels Beauty and the Beast's Gaston. Strangely, a disproportionately large amount of his lines are voiced, while the bulk of the rest of Torment's dialogue remains disappointingly relegated to text. When you play Torment: Tides of Numenera, you might as well be reading a book. \u201c On that note, don't expect a bunch of pretty cutscenes to relay all this. Know that when you sit down to play Torment: Tides of Numenera, you might as well be reading a book. Aside from a quick tutorial, whole hours went by before I had to draw my sword. The voice acting, while excellent, shows up about as often as rain in the Sahara (unless, of course, you're around Erritis). It's tough to pull off this kind of text-heavy design \u2013 even Pillars of Eternity sometimes slips into drudgery because of it \u2013 but the quality of the writing here manages to sustain the story for nearly the entirety of its roughly 35 hours. (Completing all the many side quests would push this number far higher.) Unfortunately, it suffers a bit from one of the main drawbacks affecting the similar recent RPG Tyranny \u2013 when the end comes, it comes quickly, along with a multitude of revelations that leave the uncomfortable impression that additional content was condensed into a few conversation.  It still delivers a fantastic story, though, the power of which largely rests on the wealth and variety of its dialogue choices. Virtually every conversation and interaction triggers a cascade of dialogue options with skill checks, usually with text that sometimes sprawls into a dozen richly styled sentences. Tides allows for three combat classes \u2013 the warrior-like Glaive, the versatile Jack, and the mage-like Nano \u2013 and the latter opens even more dialogue options through the ability to read minds. In fact, conversations offer such a dizzying array of options that it's sometimes difficult to figure out how to end them (especially because the UI doesn\u2019t gray out options you\u2019ve already read through). The red tide doesn't necessarily mean you're evil. \u201c Fortunately, carefully choosing each one isn't just about being rewarded with another burst of well-crafted text: much the fun of Tides consists of discovering how each option affects the influence of the titular tides over you. Persist in asking multiple questions and you'll gain points in the blue tide, which favors inquisitiveness. Do a good deed and you'll gain favor with the gold tide, which champions self-sacrifice. It's tempting to brand these as simple D&D-style alignments, but the twist is that Tides is written in such a way that your self-sacrifice could come with an ulterior motive. The red tide doesn't necessarily mean you're evil, it merely means that you act on your first impulses. Mixed together, they decide how other people react to you, which sometimes even carries over into combat. It's a decent foundation for replay, as you could either talk your way through almost everything or try to stick a sword in everyone who looks at you funny.  I usually found the combat comparatively dull. \u201c I can't say I found the thought of the latter particularly appealing. Not because I'm opposed to hacking up a few digital bad dudes with digital swords \u2013 far from it \u2013 but because I usually found the combat comparatively dull. The problem lies in the number of enemies it tosses at you. Tides of Numenera delights in piling several enemies on the Last Castoff and his or her buds at once, and they hit hard, making it uncommonly tough to survive even with the use of ciphers or taking advantage of an option to kill the leader and cause their followers to go running. Most of the time, though, it's just kind of tedious. The problems revealed themselves in an early \"crisis\" (Tides' fancy name for a battle), in which I had to sneak past a gaggle of humanoid insects while distracting them with musical objects. I only had one companion at the time, and there were maybe seven of the other guys. So every time I'd move, I'd have to wait for all of them to move as well, thus forcing the incident to go on far longer than it needed to. I didn't even try to fight them. That's probably a good thing. When I later finally had to jump into a real fight after a poorly chosen response, I realized I barely knew what to do with all the combat skills I'd amassed from leveling. Even when I was prepared, my little band of four would themselves surrounded with, say, seven cultists. More often than not, though, combat comes off as a distraction \u2013 so it\u2019s a good thing you never really have to fight. At the same time, Tides\u2019 battles include some interesting ideas. For instance, the influence of the tides carries over into combat, and sometimes on your turn you can use your influence to possibly persuade or intimidate a foe into ending a fight that's already started. Another strength is that each combat scenario feels carefully crafted rather than a random load of trash mobs thrown into a room, and there's a decent variety of combat skills depending on class \u2013 such as \"Warp Dash,\" which lets Jacks teleport to enemies and slash everyone in sight \u2013 and one-use ciphers, which unleash devastating attacks (and sometimes explode in your face if you're carrying too many at once). The animations aren't that special, but one thing it does well is allow for smart positioning in combat on both PC and console. The battles disappoint overall, but that doesn't mean there's not some sense of strategy outside the squabbles peppered among the reams of dialogue boxes. One of Tides' better features in this regard is the \"effort\" system, which lets each character in the party draw from a pool of stat points every in-game day to add a little boost to the effectiveness of an action. Need to figure out how some eon-old gadget works? Pump a few effort points into the task and you'll have a greater chance to override it even if your class would fail the skill check in another RPG. It also works in combat, allowing you to land strikes that might have missed. Their limited design, much like the rest of Tides of Numenera, has the nice side effect of encouraging thoughtful play. Early on, it's hard to shake off the temptation of use effort points to their full effect at every opportunity, but I found greater reward in learning how to wait until I truly needed them."

        "id": "860311b6f9ca542cac2c189bd50ccd90",
        "Content": "\"Why do you think that birds fly?\" This riddle is posed in the first hour of Tales of Berseria, the emotionally ragged semi-prequel to Tales of Zestiria that ripped my heart out again and again with its cautionary tale of a woman so bent on vengeance that every road she follows leads to perdition. By the time the credits rolled on this 45-hour long action RPG I still wasn't sure what the answer was, but I knew this: Berseria is the best Tales game I've played, and my favorite to date. Berseria's greatest strength lies in its ability to tell a different kind of story from those of its predecessors. Instead of the cheery, can-do spirit I've come to expect from the series, Berseria fully explores the darkest parts of the human heart. There's no real sunny side to the anti-heroine Velvet Crowe, who drives the plot with her unquenchable thirst for bloody vengeance on the man who took everything from her. Nor is there much hope of redemption for the memorable company she keeps, which includes the enraged pirate Eizen, the mouthy and detached witch Magilou, and the fratricidal demon Rokurou. These characters reflect just how emotionally broken their world has become in the face of multiple calamities. Only the fragile Malak (spirit) Laphi and the earnest Exorcist Elenor keep this ragtag group anchored in hope and distinct from the actual villains. Even then, the ties that bind them threaten to come undone as their search for the truth behind the theo-political machinations of a tight group of elites collides with their need for personal vengeance. Berseria fully explores the darkest parts of the human heart. \u201c At first I had a hard time believing the people Velvet kidnapped, cajoled, or manipulated into following her had reason to stay by her side as long as they did. Then, as their personal tragedies unfurled and the characters indulged in the usual dialogue skits Tales is known for, I began to understand their growing camaraderie. I smiled whenever Rokurou and Eizen disagreed to agree, laughed at Magilou's tactless jokes, and held my breath nervously whenever Eizen and Velvet clashed over what to do next. (\"If you die, you die alone,\" the pirate growls ominously during one very tense scene.) Each character is given sufficient time in the spotlight and with each other, which allowed me to invest in their well being as individuals and as a group. I can barely remember the names of any Tales heroes that came before Berseria, but I feel like I'll remember this motley crew for a long time to come. While Berseria flips the script on Tales' normally sunshine-filled stories, the brawler-inspired combat stays pretty much the same, with a few welcome tweaks that make it feel smooth and responsive. A variation of the Linear Motion Battle System that lets you run around a 3D battlefield returns, but now instead of using a move-governing mechanic, each action is tied to a character's Soul Gauge, which depletes every time a party member performs a special skill (Arte) in battle. Depleting a character's Soul Gauge allows enemies to more easily deflect attacks, while maxing out a character's Soul Gauge allows you to activate Break Souls, a temporary state where a character's combo limits are ignored and they can use a unique set of skills \u2013 such as Velvet's hard-hitting Consuming Claw-to take a bite out of the enemy's health and inflict a status effect.  Although the Soul Gauge will replenish over time, I found it much more fun to hurry the process along by pounding souls out of an enemy while trying to avoid a similar beatdown. I really like this new system because it adds a bit of sensible strategy to the gameplay without feeling like I'm being forced to conserve or use up energy just for the sake of it. Battles have a more cohesive flow. \u201c A few other nice features include how Artes are conveniently hotkeyed to the Playstation 4's face buttons and can be swapped out at any time, more responsive blocking and dodging, and the ability to spend points tied to the Blast Gauge meter. These points either trigger a character's fun-to-watch Mystic Arte (My favorite is Magilou's Ascending Angel, where she stretches a paper doll to impossible lengths and then slaps the crap out of multiple enemies on the battlefield) or can be partially allocated to activate Switch Blast, where reserve characters gain a combat advantage-such as an extra soul-whenever they switch places with an active party member. These additions give battle a more cohesive flow, helped by a mostly well-behaved camera and enjoyable music. (For those who enjoy playing with friends, superfluous but serviceable multiplayer during battle is also available.) The only issue I had was learning the terms and conditions for when and how to effectively use Break Souls and Switch Blast. It was tricky, but once I deciphered Berseria's playbook I had a hellishly good time dishing out punishment to lizardmen and wolves, and I got immense satisfaction using the scraps of metal and ingredients they left behind to enhance equipment and whip up mouth-smacking, stat-boosting feasts between battles. I had a hellishly good time dishing out punishment to lizardmen and wolves. \u201c The one place where Berseria doesn't shine as brightly is the garden-variety locations and lack of deep exploration. Our ragtag adventurers travel across lovely but linear flower fields and dreary marshes connected by nodes, or via a ship that travels around a large archipelago on a 2D map.  While I appreciated the occasional ocean cliff to ascend or colorful puzzle dungeon to solve, for the most part I was pretty bored by the generic scenery. Lots of mandatory backtracking and limited fast-travel didn't help, even with the introduction of the \"geoboard,\" a clunky magical surfboard that let me get from point A to point B a little faster than normal. There were a few things that managed to keep my sense of exploration alive. One was the unlockable treasure chests containing collectible costumes scattered throughout the world. These cat-eared, bubble-gum pink \"Katz Boxes\" made me squeal with delight whenever I saw them, and I became obsessed with gathering magical orbs called Katz Spirits to try to open as many as I could. Minigames and battle arenas that helped sharpen my combat skills were also a welcome reprieve from the tedium of ping-ponging between the same areas, and I enjoyed sending a pirate ship around the world to collect new recipes and valuable treasure for me. Berseria gives you the choice  of hearing Japanese or English, and it\u2019s a good thing I went with English. Not because the Japanese cast failed to perform well, but rather because the subtitles are incredibly strange. Lines like \u201cThat\u2019s gruesome by any standards\u201d became a chuckle-worthy \u201cthat\u2019s goose by any standards,\u201d and \u201ceven death can be a kind of release\u201d became \u201ceven depth can be a kind of release,\u201d turning the adage into a riddle. Was this the devious doings of autocorrect? A clumsy translation?  Who knows, but it was a needless distraction. Luckily, the English voice cast hits it out of the park, and their strong deliveries were able to evoke a wide spectrum of emotions in me, including tears and belly laughter. It\u2019s proof that a good voice cast can make all the difference in how much I enjoy the story."

        "id": "f98923a9b56f1027d112e896442b0de1",
        "Content": "Crypt of the NecroDancer has one of the most ingenious game design twists I\u2019ve come across in some time. This dungeon-crawler\u2019s gameplay is fundamentally tied to its music. You move on the beat, and so too do your enemies, making every encounter an elaborate dance. Get the steps right and it\u2019s a thing of beauty.  Of course, being a roguelike, the penalties for getting them wrong can be severe, and you can very quickly find yourself starting again. The beauty of Crypt of the NecroDancer\u2019s central concept, however, is that every run is essentially a series of puzzles to be solved. Sure, there\u2019s plenty of randomness, and there\u2019s no denying that picking up a bad-ass weapon, some armour, a sweet charm and some health-restoring food can make a journey into the NecroDancer\u2019s lair a whole lot easier, but there\u2019s predictability within the randomness: enemy movements follow the same rules each time, so defeating them is all about knowing the steps.   You\u2019re actually doing more of a nervous jig than a dance as you hop from tile to tile, puzzle solving to the beat. As the music plays your enemies come ever closer, forcing you to find and exploit an opening before it\u2019s too late. The rules of engagement are pretty simple. If you and an enemy both try and hop onto the same tile on the same beat you\u2019ll take damage. Instead, you want to move so you\u2019re adjacent to an enemy, which then lets you attack. You\u2019ll only take damage if the enemy then tries to jump into your tile and doesn\u2019t die from your attack.  It\u2019s pretty cool working out how to outmanoeuvre NecroDancer's varied bestiary. The dirt walls within each dungeon can be dug out, for instance, which is great from an exploration/discovery perspective, but it also enables you to \u2018dig buffer\u2019 \u2013 to dig a dirt tile out and thus stay stationary for a beat. Need to let an enemy jump one tile closer while you stay in the same spot? This is the way to do that without losing your coin multiplier.  The gameplay, then, is entirely geared around manipulating enemy movement patterns so that you can safely attack. This might be about knowing that an enemy jumps forward one square every four beats, which enables you to jump in and attack twice before jumping away and having it follow so you then have three more beats to finish it off. Monkeys move on every beat, while red dragons can one-shot you from across the screen. Each failed run teaches you more about how each enemy moves, which then \u2013 hopefully \u2013 makes it easier to execute your dance of death next time. Cleverly, though, Crypt of the NecroDancer\u2019s randomly generated dungeons never let you get too complacent. The music changes with each floor you descend within a zone, for instance, forcing you to adjust to a new tempo. Each of the four zones also has its own set of enemies and its own gameplay tweaks, and ends in a randomly chosen boss fight, making it its own distinct challenge.  Every level in Zone 3, for instance, is divided into fire and ice sections, with music that shifts in tone depending on which one you\u2019re in. There are ice creatures that leave behind frozen tiles which you slip across, adding another wrinkle to kiting enemies correctly, while the lava tiles that appear in the wake of fire monsters will deal damage if you walk on more than one in a row. Ice tiles can also be melted to create water tiles, which are their own obstacle.  Zone 4, on the other hand, sees the digging mechanic change so that it\u2019s multiple tiles at a time, changing how buffering works but also allowing the player to knock down the scarabs that perch atop walls. Here you also have enemies that parry attacks, drop live bombs when defeated and teleport the player.  Each zone, then, requires its own approach and knowledge-base, but even when you\u2019ve got something of a handle on enemy movement patterns, Crypt of the NecroDancer still offers up a good challenge. No two games will ever be the same, and when the soundtrack is bumping along and you have to quickly appraise a room and execute a sequence with multiple enemies all moving to their own beat, it\u2019s all too easy to mess up. The fire and ice theme is great - particularly its impact on the soundtrack.  The right loot can really help, and can also drastically change the feel of the gameplay. Broadswords can do damage to adjacent tiles for instance, whereas the crossbow can fire up to four tiles ahead, but needs to be reloaded \u2013 on the beat. You can also expand your viewing range with torches, upgrade your shovel so it can dig through tougher walls, put on armour to raise your base defence stats, eat food to restore health, pick up a wide variety of spells, expand your health or carrying capacity, wear a number of charms and crowns, find dungeon maps and so on.  And of course, you\u2019re deciding what to pick up and what to buy while hopping back and forth, adding somewhat comical pressure to even the act of gearing up. Is an obsidian rapier better than a golden whip? Is it worth swapping my pick-axe for a glass shovel given it will shatter when I take damage? Is the Ring of Charisma better than the Ring of Luck?  There are just so many variables here, and like most roguelikes you\u2019re always in search of that dream run, where you get helpful gear that makes pushing through the area you\u2019re in more straightforward. It\u2019s entirely possible to get by with just the dagger, but what a difference a bit of reach and some armour makes. After all, death can come very very swiftly in Crypt of the NecroDancer. All it really takes is getting a single strong enemy\u2019s attack pattern wrong and you\u2019re dead. And starting all over again. Well, mostly.  NecroDancer does have a meta game, where you spend diamonds earned during runs on gear that directly upgrades you \u2013 like extra starting life \u2013 or on items that will then appear within the game. It helps keep the game evolving, but unlike a game like Rogue Legacy \u2013 where you have a long road of small incremental upgrades to make over the course of the game that gradually improve your chances - you\u2019ll run out of things to spend your diamonds on before too long here. Zone 4 is pure chaos.  That\u2019s a little disappointing given diamonds are a core collectable, but it does make sense given NecroDancer\u2019s overall design philosophy. This game, after all, is driven by the pursuit of tactical metronomic movement, and its longevity comes from twisting the core gameplay with the many unlockable characters.  There\u2019s the Monk, for instance, who is killed instantly if he picks up gold, but can choose one free item from the merchant each time he appears. There\u2019s the pacifist, Dove, who doesn\u2019t kill enemies \u2013 just confuses them with the flower she wields \u2013 and for whom the exits are always unlocked and there are no boss battles. There\u2019s Eli, who takes a page out of Bomberman\u2019s book, with no weapons, just infinite bombs, which he can kick at enemies. And then there\u2019s Melody, who wields a golden lute, which only does damage when she\u2019s adjacent to enemies, demanding a completely different approach to combat.  With ten playable characters in all, each offers up quite a unique challenge. The one I\u2019ve spent the most time using other than Cadence \u2013 the starter character \u2013 is actually the Bard, as he effectively makes the game turn-based. Global movement remains tied to the beat, but you no longer have to move in time with the backing track. What that means is that the music plays as per normal, but if you\u2019re not moving, the gameworld is effectively frozen. Move a tile and everything moves forward a step. Hop through the map at pace and everything else moves in fast motion. It\u2019s a cool twist because it means you can puzzle out how to defeat each level without the time pressure of having to move on every actual beat. It makes you a puppet master, in other words. And yet I still die\u2026 over and over.  There\u2019s more here too. Mod support is baked right in. There\u2019s a level editor. The final game has three versions of the soundtrack to switch between \u2013 and you can set the soundtrack on a character by character basis. Not only that, but you can allocate your own music as the soundtrack, which is every bit as cool as it sounds. You can play local co-op with a friend, you can take on a daily challenge, you can practice against every enemy and every boss using every weapon. Oh, and hey, you want to literally dance your way through the game? There\u2019s an easier mode for anyone with a dance mat. Bosses riff on the dancing theme, and aren't overly punishing."

        "Content": "Sprawling in both story and level design, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a more fleshed out, ambitious follow-up to its 2012 predecessor. There are a few truly frustrating moments, but that sense of flow is still here; it\u2019s a relentless, rhythmic, and brutal game of killing fast, and often dying even faster.  Hotline Miami 2\u2019s style is a smooth continuation of the first game. It moves the setting ahead into the grungy \u201890s, but also occasionally whips us back to the mid-\u201980s in a feverish rollercoaster ride that further unfolds the twisted story. This is a deep dive into an engaging alternate history full of masked fanatics, mobsters, drugs, war, and a few haunting figures from the past. The soundtrack, dripping with nervous synth and a pulsing bass, is even better than the last one; a moodier and more expansive set of tracks merges appropriately with the symphony of door-busting, skull-crunching, and gun firing you\u2019ll create yourself. Like the last game, the music is the fuel that drove me forward into each new challenge \u2013 and in Hotline Miami 2, there are plenty.  Hotline Miami 2 carries on the same top-down twitch-shooter gameplay and ultra-violent retro art style of the original, shifted only slightly to make things feel fresh. What\u2019s changed most is the scale of the levels. Where Hotline Miami 1 had you shooting, stabbing, and bludgeoning enemies in a series of small rooms and hallways, Hotline Miami 2 isn\u2019t afraid to drop you into vast, open areas, where danger lurks outside the boundaries of your screen. This is an interesting change of pace that demands a new, more cautious approach.  These large-levels can end up feeling a little too imposing for their own good. There were several points when clearing even half an area became a painstaking task, and in a game where all of that progress can be destroyed in an instant by an off-screen enemy with a shotgun, it\u2019s really tough.  What saves it from being overly frustrating are a few new ways of dealing with distant threats: most notably an improved lock-on system. Pushing the lock-on button instantly targets the enemy closest to your cursor; if the enemy is outside your range of vision, a red arrow appears to point you to him until you either undo lock-on or track him down.  It\u2019s a slightly unfair advantage, but serves to balance out the leap in difficulty that comes with Hotline Miami 2\u2019s more sizable maps.

It\u2019s less of an ambiguous mystery, but just as bizarre and fun to piece together. The more plot-driven approach means we don\u2019t get as much freedom to choose how we tackle each level, because most are tied to a specific character. The upside is that it also allows room for Hotline Miami 2 to present new situations, interesting characters, and unpredictable events that break away from the typical expectations of a sequel.  Hotline Miami has always been known for its mindless killing, but in Hotline Miami 2, the dozen playable characters are defined by their personal motivations. You can play as a soldier who kills because he\u2019s in a warzone, which is a very different reason from the copycat killers who recreate the crimes of the original Hotline Miami character. This saves it from falling into gross repetition or suffering from style over substance. It also means that Hotline Miami 2 can explore new scenarios, thanks to character-specific goals.  One character, in a shocking twist for Hotline Miami, can actually get through a level without killing anybody (unless you manage to send him into a murderous rage). Knocking someone down and picking up their guns results in an animation of you rendering the weapons non-lethal. Playing through these levels is very close to the lethal ones, mechanically speaking, but it\u2019s still an interesting example of a character\u2019s personality changing things up.  While many levels are bound to a particular character, there are a few that do offer some choice, either variations of a mask or other accessories that grant different abilities. The carnage wreaked by the chainsaw- and gun-wielding brother-sister duo in Swan masks was especially fun to play, but I also enjoyed the sequences featuring characters who don\u2019t even wear masks at all. In terms of story, a restraint like this makes sense and is a great way to get us closer to what\u2019s happening and why, but in terms of gameplay, it can feel limiting. It\u2019s a trade-off; a negotiation between some of Hotline Miami 2\u2019s more arcade-like aspects and a more fully fleshed-out story that allows for the exploration of several different tones and moods.  Fortunately, an unlockable Hard Mode prevents some loss in replay value. This new difficulty mode mirrors level layouts, adds more enemies, and removes the ability to lock on \u2013 all excellent tweaks if you love a challenge. An early version of the Hotline Miami map editor is also included, which is already easy to use and is a great way for the community to expand the life of Hotline Miami 2."

        "Content": "In a lot of ways, Grow Home is a delight. It\u2019s beautiful, original, fluid, and completely charming. It\u2019s a game about climbing, platforming, and exploration, but quickly became much more than that the moment I walked my adorably childlike robot character off a floating island and free-fell thousands of feet before swooping in to a safe landing on a leaf glider. Even though I have a personal discomfort with heights, this game made me feel happy as I climbed into its sky.  Its charm comes across immediately upon touching down in this gorgeous, vivid, polygonal new world. The flat but colorful look strikes a balance between memories of the Nintendo 64 adventures of yore and the emotive design of Pixar animation. Everything is bright, bold, and bursting with personality.  And B.U.D., (Botanical Utility Droid) is a fantastic example of how movement can speak volumes more than words, thanks to the procedurally generated animations that power his arms and legs. You\u2019ll push him one way, then change directions mid-stride and watch as he struggles to shift his course against momentum without losing balance, the same way a child might grapple with their own mass and motion.  Of course, those animations \u2013 like anything generated on the fly \u2013 come with their own quirks. The plucky robot\u2019s feet are in a constant state of motion, and more often than not, unnatural contortion. His many parts will sometimes knot themselves, turning the bipedal B.U.D. into more of a ball of scrap. It\u2019s never more than a minor annoyance, and usually occurs in tight spaces and snaps back shortly thereafter, but it does detract from the otherwise smooth, serene nature of Grow Home.  That childlike element is reinforced by the onboard counterpart M.O.M., which encourages you whether you reach new heights or shatter on the ground at the end of a lengthy freefall at terminal velocity and rematerialize at the last checkpoint. That maternal vein that runs through Grow Home adds to the sense of serenity. Though gravity and your own miscalculations are your greatest enemy, this world is a safe playground through which to climb and jump and soar and dive.  Climbing the giant plant that you must nurture into providing you a way to the heavens uses an unusual but quickly intuitive control setup. Each of B.U.D\u2019s arms is independently controlled with the corresponding mouse buttons or triggers, so climbing becomes a matter of holding onto the terrain with one hand, pushing yourself upward, gripping with the other hand, and repeat. While it\u2019s certainly reminiscent of games that are intentionally clumsy for comedy purposes (like I Am Bread and Octodad) I didn\u2019t feel like Grow Home wanted me to fail at this. Grabbing terrain and objects boils movement down to its most basic elements, and learning to use them was like experiencing the world as a child. Left hand, right hand.  Though in the beginning, scrambling up cliffsides might feel like a herculean feat, eventually it becomes second nature, and new elements like flower parachutes, leaf-gliders, and catapults create new ways to float and fall and frolick throughout the world. After a few hours I gathered enough of the scattered power crystals to unlock new powers ranging from a life-saving jetpack to an expanded camera view, allowing for a wider view of your surroundings and the hidden crystals therein, both of which changed the way I played and kept the steady upward climb from becoming too repetitive.

        "Content": "Great news! The first handheld installment of the excellent Super Smash Bros. series lives up to incredibly high standards. Like its console siblings, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS elegantly packages decades of Nintendo\u2019s best video game mascots into a pick-up-and-play portable game. But the real surprise here is the diverse modes of play that\u2019ve kept me playing feverishly for days. Smash 3DS builds a fast and fun four-player brawler out of prolific video game characters and universes. Each one uses the same inputs to activate their unique moves, so once you\u2019ve learned one, you can play all 48 of them. Winning is about knowing the right time to use Mario\u2019s fireball , which is different from Marth\u2019s Dancing Blade , in effort to knock everyone else out of the ring with a perfectly timed Smash attack. Characters , stages , items , and assist trophies pull inspiration from a diverse selection of games and showcase lots tiny details that highlight each one\u2019s special qualities. From the start, the variety of the 36-character roster impressed me, and 12 more fighters are unlocked over time . Newcomers like Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening, Rosalina & Luma from Super Mario Galaxy, Little Mac from Punch Out!!!, and more join the battle alongside mainstays like Mario, Link , Pikachu , and Samus . Even non-Nintendo characters like Pac-Man and Mega Man are embraced with genuine reverence to their source material. Wii Fit Trainer is a great example of the humor: This silly callout to the massively popular Wii Fit series transforms the peaceful art of Yoga into a fun fighting style. I love how she doles out helpful advice in between all the hits. That same attention to detail in all the characters meant I was constantly finding something new and fun for dozens of hours. All of the action in Smash 3DS moves at a solid 60 frames per second. I noticed that characters appear a little chunkier than their console counterparts, but that has the effect of making them easier to see. A helpful red or blue outline communicates which side you\u2019re playing for in Team versus mode, which is a big help in a crazy brawl. However, Nintendo hasn\u2019t managed to solve one significant issue when bringing Smash Bros. to the 3DS: Namely, it\u2019s difficult to keep track of characters whenever the camera zooms out in heated four-player matches. They\u2019re just too tiny! A targeting box activated via the 3DS touch screen helped a little, but it feels like a band-aid solution for a larger problem. Scaling down to three player free-for-alls makes things much easier to follow, but one-on-one play shows off this handheld version in the best environment possible. title=&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=smash-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article What really impresses me about Smash 3DS is the many ways to play, and its many layers of unique customization. Building custom fighters is an easy process, too. It lets you define layers of equipment that affect easy-to-understand parameters of power, defense, and speed. Improving one area decreases the value of another, so I could weigh out several options and settle on the fighter that works for me. Mii Fighter special moves are, thankfully, all unlocked from the start, but custom moves for main roster need to be unlocked. Menus feel a little scattered, but once I learned where everything is, it was easy to jump into solo, local, or online play. I can easily switch up rules before a match, and select from several different stage variations. There\u2019s even a helpful lobby to practice in before a host launches a local match. Online play is carefully separated, so you can jump between ranked matches, smashing with friends, spectating online bouts, or even a custom replay channel where you can watch one character to learn what attack combinations people are using. Of the eight modes Smash 3DS gives you to choose from, I spent a lot of time switching between regular matches, variations of Multi-man Smash, and online one-vs-one play the most. All-Star mode took me through a chronological history of Smash Bros. that started in the early \u201880s and ended in 2013. Classic mode resembles the single-player mode in GameCube\u2019s Smash Melee, but with a twist: I could choose my next challenge on a map and pick up trophies and gold to unlock even more stuff. Sadly, the random nature behind the exclusive 3DS mode, called Smash Run , make it the one part of Smash 3DS I had trouble enjoying. The core idea itself is a gluttonous stat grab where you have to spend five minutes at a time collecting power ups that increase speed, jump, attack, special, arms, and defense to prepare for a final battle or a randomized competition like a race. The AI enemies in Smash Run\u2019s generic sprawling area are unrelenting, which is fine, but the randomly selected final match could be something I\u2019m completely unprepared for because I didn\u2019t have the right stats needed to win that type of challenge. Being the slowest runner in a race just isn\u2019t fun. If Smash Run leveraged some insight into the final fight, it could be a lot more memorable than what it currently is. title=More%20Hot%20Reviews&type=articles&tags=review-recirc&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article"

        "Content": "Every time a new Monster Hunter games comes out, I think: surely, I must be done with this now. After several hundred hours over at least three versions, I\u2019m not going to get sucked in again. But I do, every time. It's because Monster Hunter\u2019s world is so absorbing, and the gentle rhythm of prepare, hunt, and collect is so innately satisfying. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the slickest game in the series to date, and it\u2019s an ideal introduction to the hugely enjoyable business of cooperative monster-slaying. The basic idea is to venture out into the wilds, find an impressive monster, kill it, and then make hats and swords out of its entrails \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. There are 12 weapons, hundreds of items, and more than 100 hours\u2019 worth of quests, but it\u2019s the thrill of the chase and the addictive rush of hard-earned victory that continually hooks me in. Monster Hunter has a reputation for being intimidating, but really it\u2019s a lot easier to get to grips with than it looks. It\u2019s challenging, sure \u2013 thrillingly challenging \u2013 but it\u2019s hardly Dark Souls. In Japan this is a game played by mums, little brothers, couples\u2026 something like five million people, going by Monster Hunter Portable 3rd\u2019s sales. All you need is someone to show you the ropes. There are a few new monsters, a rearranged single-player experience and a whole new multiplayer area, but the meat and bones are the same as 2010\u2019s Monster Hunter Tri \u2013 with updated graphics on Wii U, of course, and much better loading times. It\u2019s got the same finely-tuned selection of weapons, the same storyline, and many of the same single-player quests, though they have been reshuffled to incorporate new monsters and the difficulty curve is slightly gentler this time around - some of the toughest missions have been moved up a rank or two, evening out a few of Tri\u2019s difficulty spikes. Whether you\u2019re playing on 3DS or Wii U, you\u2019re getting the same experience, which is pretty remarkable in itself. You can transfer your save between the two platforms using a free app from the eShop. You can play online on Wii U, but not on 3DS \u2013 and if there\u2019s four of you in a room together, you can play locally on three handheld consoles and one Wii U, and the TV screen becomes an HD showcase for your battle - which is by far the most exciting way to play. Monster Hunter really comes alive in multiplayer, so you\u2019ll want to coerce some friends into playing with you. Show them a few of the best battles, though, and they probably won\u2019t need much persuasion. The graphical update is a touch disappointing for players of Tri, though. It\u2019s clear that Capcom has spent most of its time making the monsters themselves look better; the environments, by contrast, are still very sparse, with some textures that are noticeably out of place in HD. The smaller monsters and non-player characters in the single- and multiplayer towns also haven\u2019t been remodelled. Touchscreen features, though, are a valuable addition. The Wii U gamepad and 3DS touchscreen can be customised with panels, so you can put your map, health and stamina, item pouch, and whatever else on the bottom screen if you want, giving you an unobstructed view of the action. It unclutters the screen, it\u2019s customisable to your tastes, and it\u2019s more convenient to actually play. Monster Hunter quests come in three broad flavours: head out and gather some of this thing, kill a number of smaller monsters, or kill one big bad monster. The third flavour makes up about 75% of the quests on offer, and those are the ones that progress you through the ranks; Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate knows we don\u2019t want to spend hours collecting mushrooms before we\u2019re allowed to fight anything. That said, crafting is integral to Monster Hunter, and gathering materials out in the wilds to make the tools you need provides the slower-paced, more soothing counterpoint to the lengthy battles. You need ore and metals for armour, herbs for making potions, plants and animal parts to combine into useful things like performance-enhancers and, of course, weapons and armour. There are only six large areas, from desert to volcano to beautiful mountain to the obligatory frozen tundra, and one new area that looks like a mystical Chinese jungle. Almost all of the quests take place in these same six areas (excepting a few that have their own special arenas); it might seem stingy, but it forces you get to know them intimately, mentally mapping every shortcut and resource point. It\u2019s all preparation for the main event. Monster Hunter\u2019s battles are among those rare video game confrontations that truly qualify as epic: they last up to 50 minutes, and at their most gut-wrenching they are battles of attrition that go right down to the wire, as you launch your lance into the air with your last sliver of stamina just as a monster opens its jaws and miraculously kill it with seconds left on the clock. It\u2019s these tremendously rewarding struggles that deliver the most powerful adrenaline surge, and if the first one works on you, you\u2019ll be chasing that hit through the 200-odd quests in the game. Underpinning Monster Hunter\u2019s grand battles is a lovably quirky sense of humour. It\u2019s got eccentric gestures, ridiculous armour, talking cats that cook your dinner, pigs in Babygro onesies, a cheesy barbecuing mini-game, and wittily translated dialogue \u2013 and the sight of my hunter haplessly sprinting away from a monster before falling on her face still raises a smile 40 hours in. The best moments in Monster Hunter are when you meet a new beast for the first time. These creatures look incredible; aggressive, distinctive, and properly alive. They don\u2019t have anything so obvious as a health bar \u2013 you have to ascertain how close you are to victory by observing their behaviour, watching for a limp, a damaged wing, or signs of tiredness. This is one of the best things about Monster Hunter \u2013 you have to rely on your instincts and get to know your quarry. There's a lot to learn about here, too. Even 50-plus hours in you will be seeing new monsters \u2013 though you\u2019ll also be seeing a lot of the same ones, or a subspecies of a different colour. If you want to make a full set of armour out of a monster you\u2019ll have to hunt it a lot. It can start to feel like a grind; friends come in handy here to alleviate the repetition. Working together towards a common goal feels a lot less like grinding than hunting the same monster on your own to mine it for parts, and gives you more room to experiment with the different weapons. These different weapons are the key to Monster Hunter\u2019s lasting appeal \u2013 whenever your hunting style is starting to feel stale, you can just craft yourself something new, and combat transforms. Playing with a greatsword feels almost like a different game than playing with a bowgun. Each of 3 Ultimate\u2019s 12 weapons is easy to learn, but there are nuances to the combat system that reward those willing to dig deeper, and within a team the dynamic of each one changes. Ranged weapons can feel a little sterile playing on your own compared to the up-close thrill of a sword or switch-axe, but in a team the bowgunner\u2019s role is more exciting. The single-player sees you trying to save a quaint little fishing town called Moga Village from mysterious monster-related earthquakes. It\u2019s a place I already know and love from Tri, but if you\u2019re new, this is where you\u2019re taught how to hunt. It has a farm where you can enlist feline minions to grow useful items for you and a fishing fleet that can bring back treasure, whilst free-hunting in Moga Woods gains you resources that you can use to help the villagers out. Playing alone, you\u2019re gifted a little companion called Cha-Cha who comes in very handy on quests, distracting monsters for you whilst you land big hits. As this is a game designed for multiplayer, his help is invaluable. In MH3 Ultimate, there\u2019s a second companion called Shakalaka who unlocks towards the end of the single-player story, just in time to help you with the high-rank quests. There\u2019s some cute competitive interplay between the two sidekicks, but essentially he\u2019s extra monster bait; it\u2019s not exactly a game-changing addition. When it\u2019s time for real multiplayer, you head to Port Tanzia, where you can meet up with friends. Local multiplayer is easy to set up, but the online interface on Wii U is unfortunately still as archaic as it was in Tri; one connection error and you\u2019ll be booted aaaaall the way back to the start screen. Once you\u2019ve managed to connect to a lobby, though, it rarely stumbled in my experience. The player population will obviously ramp up post-release (and in April, a patch is coming that will let American and European friends play on the same servers), but it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the servers will be slammed. Monster Hunter has often been a series where you have to work around its quirks, whether it was the absurd claw-like hand position needed to operate the camera on the PSP versions or the inconvenient lack of online multiplayer. With 3 Ultimate, a lot of these frustrations are gone; both versions control well. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate wasn\u2019t made for the Wii U controller and it does feel a little awkward at first, but it never gets in the way of enjoying the game. On 3DS, even without the Circle Pad Pro attachment, controlling the camera using the touchscreen works surprisingly well. It\u2019s not quite perfect, but it\u2019s certainly a lot better than it ever was on the PSP; it\u2019s only noticeably slow when you\u2019re fighting underwater. Target Camera, meanwhile, lets you focus the camera on large monsters, which is a godsend for newer players."

        "Subtitle": "Come fly the not-so-friendly skies.",
        "Content": "When the tentacle reached out of the huge-even-by-medieval-standards tome \u2013 the first of Dragonborn\u2019s collection of magical Black Books \u2013 wrapped itself around my level-31 Redguard warrior\u2019s neck, and physically pulled me into the fantastical realm of Daedric prince Hermaeus Mora, I was hooked. And also a little bit nostalgic. Dragonborn \u2013 the second major expansion pack for the sublime Skyrim \u2013 takes many cues from Morrowind, the beloved third game in the Elder Scrolls role-playing series. That\u2019s largely because it\u2019s set on the island of Solstheim, a land last seen in the Bloodmoon expansion for Elder Scrolls III. While it\u2019s still very Skyrim-y overall, some of its dungeons and locales set it apart from the mainland you\u2019ve probably already spent dozens of hours living in. To the south, for instance, is Tel Mithryn, a gorgeous overgrown Smurf village dominated by gigantic mushroom homes and stacked with interesting quests, like chasing down a fledgling spellcaster\u2019s runaway magic summon-gone-wrong. Its discovery will be a complete and utter surprise for the uninitiated \u2013 odds are you\u2019ll stumble on it simply by making your way towards the massive erupting volcano to the south (sadly, you cannot actually get to it). Solstheim\u2019s dungeons are an equally fresh experience. The aforementioned Black Book realms \u2013 festooned with tentacles, acidic seas, and eyeballs in the sky \u2013 make for creepy hunting, and even the usual Dwemer or snowy dungeons throw new puzzle wrinkles into their otherwise familiar formula. You\u2019ll be fighting a handful of new enemies in them too, which helps. Disgusting Seekers float around and confuse you by cloning decoys of themselves, while the goblin-like Rieklings sometimes ride wild boars and always throw spears at you. Pro tip: be sure to visit the Trisk Mead Hall and talk to \u2013 do not attack \u2013 the pack of Rieklings out front. It will lead you on a hilarious sidequest. All that exploration, combat, and book collecting is in an effort to power yourself up and ultimately take down Miraak, the ancient, original Dragonborn \u2013 essentially the Bizarro World version of you \u2013 who\u2019s not pleased about you joining his exclusive Fus-Ro-Dah Club. Though simple and archetypal, it\u2019s actually an engaging tale that feels rushed despite taking between six and eight hours to complete (sidequests add a lot more playtime, however). The scale of the story, during which you\u2019ll search for Black Books and destroy Miraak\u2019s elemental shrines scattered about the world, feels like it needed more time and more quests in order to properly convey its scope. Dragonborn\u2019s biggest new feature is arguably the ability to ride dragons. You don\u2019t gain the skill to do so until you learn all three words of a new Dragon Shout, which happens at the end of the main quest. When you finally do, you\u2019re probably going to be a bit disappointed. It\u2019s not a completely passive experience, a la Grand Theft Auto IV\u2019s taxi rides, but it\u2019s only a step above that. You can command your winged, scaly beast to land, lock onto targets, and attack, but that\u2019s it. No airborne quests or other shenanigans. Any dreams you have of flying freely around Solstheim and Skyrim, snatching town NPCs in your dragon\u2019s clutches, then dropping them to their doom from a mile-high altitude are going to have to stay dreams for now.",

        "Subtitle": "Word is bond!",
        "Content": "A witch asked me to help her stop two pesky children from eating her house so I made it rotten and they ran away in disgust. An arsonist pleaded with me in desperation as his crippling penchant for destruction was ruining the world around him, so I gave him a therapist and they talked until he put his bad habits to rest. A lowly street peddler wept at his inability to make his way in the cold world around him so I introduced him to a teacher who taught him skills and inspired him to enter a life of gainful employment. A giant human heart began attacking a group of unsuspecting people so I threw some aspirin at it since that\u2019s a great way to prevent those types of things from happening in real life, I suppose. In a few short breaths I\u2019m a social worker, a baker, a doctor, a warrior, a savior of cities, and an inspirer of worlds. Flowers grow, birds flutter overhead, and newly remodeled buildings shimmer as jubilant citizens surround it with glee.  And then I unleashed a giant Minotaur holding a chainsaw upon them all, because f*ck it.  Scribblenauts Unlimited might be gaming\u2019s greatest toy box. Its Super Mario Paint meets Grand Theft Auto and whatever else your warped little mind decides to splash across its blank canvases at any given instant. It\u2019s a driven collection of hundreds of puzzles set in a sprawling open world spanning dozens of themes. It\u2019s a game where nearly every single word you type out on your keyboard becomes an object you can interact with on the fly. And it\u2019s a wonderful little bundle of joy.   The premise here is roughly the same elevator pitch we got back in 2009 with the original Scribblenauts, just with a bounty of added control tweaks and minor nuances added to smooth out the process. Type a word and a cartoon representation of that word appears on screen as something you can interact with. Add an attribute to that word and you can interact with it further. A character asks for a friend. You give him a gorilla. Or a giant gorilla. Or a dead gorilla, if you\u2019re feeling morbid. Voila. A Mario World inspired overworld connects lots of little puzzle hubs, meaning you can hop around and tackle everything the game has to offer instead of being trapped in the linearity of the \u201cfinish a puzzle to start the next\u201d sequential progression of the last few Scribblenauts titles. And aside from a few small snags, it works very well.  Old Scribblenauts\u2019 standbys still seem to rule over anything much more elaborate that your brain may conjure, though. A sleeping pill will incapacitate any man or animal that needs to be put down without death. A black hole does a better job at clearing away waste than a broom ever could. And invoking a deadly cartoon laser gun battle between God and Satan on a total whim never gets old. All in all the puzzles feel a bit easier and simpler this go around. But it\u2019s the rapid fire nature in which Unlimited presents each challenge (and the myriad ways to solve them) that really sets the experience apart from its previous iterations. Coupled with the nearly infinite combination of pretty much every non-nude, non-alcoholic and non-licensed noun you can summon and Unlimited nearly lives up to its name.  Scribblenauts looks beautiful on a big, shiny PC monitor. Inputting words via keyboard is quicker than tapping them out with a stylus on a Nintendo touch screen, but I found the overall experience of switching back and forth between that and a mouse (as to determine exactly where I wanted to drop my spawned items) a little bit cumbersome. With time I could see myself becoming well adjusted to this scheme, though, and unlike the Wii U version, all of the action takes place on one screen, making the PC a wonderful platform to enjoy the best Scribblenauts yet. Just don't expect to find any Nintendo themed characters in this version, obviously. Those remain exclusively over on the Wii U.",
