        "Content": "Continue?9876543210 is a game about symbolism and death. This isn't unique, as virtually every videogame makes heavy use of symbols \u2013 a red cross symbolizes health; a block of buildings with a star represents a capital city. What makes Continue? unique is that it embraces and understands the symbolism of games and abstract narrative, and constructs its story entirely around that understanding. The actual game side of Continue? occasionally interferes with the overall experience, but it is fascinating. Symbolic storytelling works because our brains fill in the blanks automatically when given incomplete information in every story. But when it's especially abstract, as Continue? is, the ambiguity is riskier. Its character design shows how this works: the piles of tiny blocks and stilted limbs approximate a human just well enough to represent most any videogame hero, without actually looking like any in particular. With every one of its components \u2013 visual style, dialogue, plot, music, and even styles of gameplay \u2013 Continue? creates an ambiguity using symbols, that works very well for it. The most immediate symbol is Continue?9876543210's title, a reference to the countdown encouraging you to put in more quarters in arcade games. (Back when those were a thing.) It's not common or necessary anymore, but it immediately points to death. That's the first thing you see starting it up: the main character keels over in a forest, and the Continue? countdown begins. This is followed by a touching and clever introduction showing a mixture of religious death imagery \u2013 going into the light, crossing the River Styx \u2013 with programming, like a set of .jsp \u201cfiles\u201d connected to the hero's limbs suddenly turning to \u201cnull.\u201d That mixture of the practical elements of the program with the metaphysical symbols of death and afterlife remains one of Continue?'s strongest aspects throughout. Your hero is unwilling to be erased, and is swept up by a program that cleans garbage from his \u201cgame's\u201d memory. So he or she moves through limbo, talking with people, figuring out a way to avoid the \u201cgarbage collector\u201d program. It all sounds very artsy, but there's a challenge behind it too: you have to play through six random levels, collecting \u201cshelter\u201d against a gathering storm, while also fighting off enemies trying to devour your \u201cRAM\u201d in arcade-style minigames based on Zelda or Space Invaders. The controls for these are too awkward for them to be the reason to play Continue? on their own, but they work in this context as an abstract meditation on videogame death \u2013 they're awkward and abstract in the same way that the characters are visually. Unlike similarly themed games (To The Moon, for example, which uses the structure of a game to tell an easily accessed story,) Continue? is challenging to complete, especially on the first run. Its overall structure of racing for shelter against deletion creates an interesting balance of time, resources, and future planning. But explaining all of that takes away from Continue?'s primary charm, which is its symbolic mystery. Much like 2012's Dear Esther or Journey, a huge amount of the \u201cgame\u201d is attempting to figure out what it\u2019s all about. For example, it uses the refrain of \u201cMy Lightning, My Prayer\u201d both as a core gameplay decision and a poetic contemplation on finding meaning in death. Death, when jsp files turn to null The writing continues in this vein. One of the first characters encountered explains that the software deletions have taken out chunks of language, making all the characters speak a broken English that veers between baby talk and poetry. Once again, this imbues Continue? with abstract meaning \u2013 whatever your brain thinks gives the symbolic dialogue the most meaning will work. On the other hand, the combination of the broken English with some of the level settings, like \u201cSlums\u201d or \u201cPrison,\u201d occasionally led me to the feeling that it\u2019s accidentally making fun of poor folk and minorities. (Likewise, one level that partially frames Juggalos as modern Native Americans due to tribal facepaint, shared songs, and ritual drinks doesn't work well.) If this sounds like Continue?9876543210 is a difficult game to grasp, that's because it is. Two components really define its core tension. First, its music glues Continue? together. Its sad, minor-key piano music for the directly death-related scenes may be a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it works well enough. It also nails the pounding danger of the battle sequences, as well as the desperate drone of the shelter levels. The artistic aspect of a game like this relies so much on mood, and the music consistently sets that mood in a way that supports the blocky graphics, broken/poetic English, and clumsy controls. My brother is also named Bort. On the other hand, the fact that there is a difficult game within Continue? serves to break that mood more than anything else. It can successfully instill a feeling of pensiveness about death in a cutscene between levels, but when you're more focused in making sure you have shelter and health, that cutscene or that poetic line of dialogue becomes an annoyance. The feeling of frustration that it sometimes instills trumps the feeling of sadness that it wants to consistently creates. In doing so, Continue?9876543210 inadvertently reveals why many games that take on difficult or emotional subjects tend to be \u201ceasy\u201d to finish: because that's the most effective way to convey the intended experience."

        "Content": "Marvel\u2019s interstellar, ragtag Guardians of the Galaxy prove a natural fit for the style of storytelling Telltale puts out these days - and it doesn\u2019t take long into Episode 1: Tangled Up in Blue to recognize why. It manages to pull together some of the best elements of the comic books, the Guardians film adaptations, and Telltale\u2019s ability to deploy well-paced and witty comedy with just enough interactivity to make you feel like a part of the action. Like Telltale\u2019s recent Batman game, this version of the Guardians doesn\u2019t seem to be ripped directly from either the comics or the movies but is rather a respectful pastiche that skews heavily toward the latter. Rocket, Groot, and Drax are almost indistinguishable from their cinematic incarnations, while Peter Quill, Gamora, and Yondu (the blue guy with the big red mohawk-thing on his head) incorporate a lot more traits from their paper-and-ink equivalents. There are also lots of small, clever easter eggs to find for devoted comics fans, which I definitely appreciated. The voice acting is applause-worthy, especially Nolan North as Rocket. Despite North\u2019s voice being heard in just about every video game ever, he turns it into something so energetic and over the top here that I wouldn\u2019t have known it was him if I hadn\u2019t been told ahead of time. It's a spot-on replication of Bradley Cooper\u2019s endearing and memorable performance from the film. Scott Porter\u2019s version of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, the primary hero, is a little lighter on the quippy delivery than Chris Pratt but brings a relatable, emotional depth to the character that fills in the gaps. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown early in the episode is a major highlight.Guardians\u2019 gameplay doesn\u2019t stray too far outside the Telltale formula we\u2019ve come to expect, with only minor but welcome additions like Peter\u2019s rocket boots allowing vertical exploration in some areas. There are semi-tedious detective segments where you wander around looking for the right thing to click on that make me long for the more difficult, puzzle-focused challenges of adventure games past. There are quippy, well-paced conversations with timed dialogue that affect various characters\u2019 impressions of you. And then there are the extended quick-time events which, while they don\u2019t involve any twists beyond hitting buttons really quickly at the right time, are some of the best Telltale has put together, presentation-wise. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown with one of Marvel\u2019s most iconic supervillains early in the episode is a major highlight. You get the joy of controlling each of the guardians and their unique abilities in an alternating fashion, becoming part of an exciting, well-choreographed brawl that looks like it could have come right off the pages of a comic. When Drax\u2019s fists aren\u2019t flying, and Rocket isn\u2019t pointing a firearm three times his size at anything that moves, Peter is forced to step in (with your guidance) to hold a group of big personalities together through a time that calls into question what their place in the galaxy really is. It\u2019s impossible to keep everyone happy all the time, and some of your friends will be almost literally at each other\u2019s throats by the episode\u2019s end, forcing you to take a side. We\u2019ll have to see how impactful these choices end up being in later episodes \u2013 it says Rocket will remember that I didn\u2019t want to do his crazy, dumb plan, but it\u2019s entirely possible everyone will be singing Kumbaya when the credits roll no matter how poor a leader I was. That would be unfortunate in terms of making our choices matter within the story, but for now at least Telltale has done a good job of making these decisions feel important and causing me plenty of enjoyable stress from trying to step up and do what a captain\u2019s gotta do amidst all the intra-team drama. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands.That mood is kept light by Guardians\u2019 comic relief. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands. There are at least a couple moments I laughed out loud at, and most of the dialogue writing is as clever and satisfying as the music choices, which delightfully echo the soundtrack of feelgood classic rock director James Gunn put together for the Guardians movies. Where the writing chops behind the episode really show, though, is in the more emotional and character-driven scenes. Intimate conversations between long-time friends experiencing big changes are authentic and moving. Particularly, a flashback scene between a young Peter and his mother felt all too real, injecting a grounded, well-executed B-plot about a kid who\u2019s still not over losing a parent into the swashbuckling space opera. One of my only other disappointments was how quickly it seemed like Tangled Up in Blue came and went. The bombastic, action-movie pacing worked well in some ways, but also prevented me from feeling like I really got to settle into and experience the world Telltale created as much as I did in the pilots for their take on Game of Thrones or any of the Walking Dead seasons. I look forward to returning and seeing the continued aftershocks of the multiple, major plot stingers (which are worth not spoiling for yourself!) as I chill with a likable, ably written and acted cast in future installments."

        "Content": "Life is Strange: True Colors has kept me more emotionally invested than any Life is Strange story since I played the original back in 2015. While every game in this adventure series is good in its own way, this one (from developer Deck Nine as opposed to the series\u2019 creators at Dontnod) addresses many consistent issues that have plagued the last three games. It proves to be the best in the series thanks to consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling mystery story with good pacing, useful supernatural abilities, and perhaps most importantly, dialogue choices that offer more depth and complexity with big and most small decisions that actually impact the story in meaningful ways throughout the course of five chapters. While you can certainly play each chapter in bits and pieces, they\u2019re all available immediately so you can binge its 14 hours of story in one sitting with no waiting. Every episode has good pacing, a clear goal, and plenty of suspense. Before writing this review, I played through True Colors multiple times and found no definitive way to experience the story. There\u2019s a notable difference from previous episodes in that there is no recap of the previous chapter when starting a new one or a teaser for the next after completing one, but in its defense, True Colors does not really need it.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You play as Alex Chen, a young woman with a troubled childhood who comes to the fictional mining town of Haven Springs, Colorado to live with her brother Gabe. After a mysterious accident, Alex uses her supernatural empathic abilities to bring the town\u2019s secrets to the surface. Personally, I wish that the trailers hadn\u2019t spoiled the nature of the central mystery for me, so if you haven\u2019t watched them yet, don\u2019t \u2013 I urge you to go in blind. Haven Springs is stunning thanks to its scenic Colorado views. From the snowy mountains in the far background to the wooden bridge that separates the bus stop from the main street filled with colorful flowers and a river stream, this is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date and a compelling and effective tourism ad for Colorado. Haven Springs is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date \u201c This is a small mountain town, and in typical small-town fashion, everyone knows their neighbors and their community is tight-knit. It comes across loud and clear that the residents genuinely care about each other. Some of this insight comes from Alex\u2019s phone, which shares details of her relationships with her friends with some text messages (the content of which varies depending on your in-game choices). Alex can also check out MyBlock, a Nextdoor-like social media platform where the townsfolk share local updates, Easter eggs, and local banter; some of which are pay-offs as a result of the choices Alex made around those characters. There\u2019s even a moment in which the entire town partakes in a LARP to cheer up a grieving kid. Seeing the townsfolk dress up in costumes in areas like the town\u2019s bar was by far my favorite moment of the entire story. There\u2019s even a light RPG element in that particular chapter that helps make the entire section a lot more fun to engage in. The people of Haven Springs also have a lot of life to them, which made me feel more emotionally invested in the community. Previous Life is Strange games have struggled with consistently giving NPCs compelling backstories and many of them were failed by poor writing. Alyssa Anderson in the original Life is Strange, Evan Harris in Before the Storm , Hank Stamper in the first episode of Life is Strange 2 all had a lack of depth that made them come off as stereotypes. But in True Colors, I can\u2019t name anybody who felt underserved. A lot of that comes from the excellent way in which you interact with them, which is enhanced by a supernatural phenomenon. Like Max Caufield in the original Life is Strange , Alex has an unexplained superpower: she can perceive strong emotions through colorful auras that outline people around her. It may not be as spectacular as turning back time, but it does go beyond just \u201creading\u201d people: if a person\u2019s feelings are strong enough, Alex will also begin to actually feel those emotions herself. It\u2019s almost like an out-of-body experience where she walks a mile in their shoes. What's the best Life is Strange game to date? Life is Strange Life is Strange: Before the Storm The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit Life is Strange 2 Answer See Results In some cases, both scripted and unscripted, Alex can interact with items that contain memories (basically audio logs) that share a bit more about certain characters. I found this to be a nice add-on to Alex\u2019s already robust empathic powers; not only can it help with dialogue choices big and small, it helps to add more perspective to Haven Springs\u2019 residents. In one instance after exploring the flower shop, I found a t-shirt memory that explained how Riley Lethe met her on-and-off-again boyfriend Mac Louden at a bot-fighting competition she participated in. And if you decide to go off the beaten path, you will be rewarded with an additional backstory for certain characters that Alex will write in her journal. Her journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character you\u2019re playing as \u2013 sometimes she will write new lyrics or share extensive detail on when she engages in another\u2019s strong emotions; you can even playback the optional memories you find. One of my favorite aspects of Deck Nine\u2019s handling of Life is Strange\u2019s story-driven format is that, unlike previous games in this series, there are so many choices \u2013 regardless of size \u2013 that impact Alex\u2019s journey and future. One example of True Colors maintains throughout the story involves a side plot with Eleanor Lethe who early on in the game you find out she is having health issues, in particular, she is suffering from memory loss. But no one in town, not even Riley, who sees Eleanor is a material figure knows of her illness. At one point late in the story just as Riley is about to leave for college, you can tell her about Eleanor\u2019s condition, but having previous conversations with both will leave you with the choice of whether to be honest and tell Riley the truth and risk violating Eleanor\u2019s trust or keep the secret and allow Riley to go away to school. Those consequences and reactions feel real and consistent thanks to the detailed facial animations and appropriate body language of NPCs. Sure, some of those reactions are emphasized and spelled out when an aura appears, but even without the aura I always had a good understanding of how a character was feeling after Alex interacted with them. Alex's journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character \u201c Because of the increased emphasis on the consequences of our actions, there were many times when I made a choice and had to second-guess whether that was what I wanted to do. No other Life is Strange game has made me reload a checkpoint save just to see a cutscene play out differently. There were times in previous games when I felt the writers would have dialogue options, you could have multiple options for a dialogue choice that is consistent with the overall protagonist, but another option felt \u201cforced\u201d or out of place. But Deck Nine\u2019s superb writing offers multiple dialogue options that all feel like something Alex would say and remain consistent with her personality. By the time you get to Chapter 5, the effects of most of the choices you\u2019ve made will play out in one way or another. It was a lovely surprise to see just how many decisions I made in earlier episodes metamorphosed into my own personal-feeling version of Chapter 5. Life is Strange has always been a series with high replayability, but this level of detail and variation in scenes makes True Colors even more rewarding for me to replay again and again. Like the previous installments, Life is Strange: True Colors has multiple endings that can result from the choices you make, none of which is a canonically \u201ctrue ending.\u201d While I initially thought I had a good idea of how the story would go, Deck Nine managed to keep me guessing \u2013 and by the time the plot twist came I was left in disbelief, eager to see how the final parts would play out. Yet each ending \u2013 and their variations \u2013 all felt natural to Alex, and she remained true to the character of someone who is happy and hopeful for the future that lay ahead. I also loved that even when Alex solves the main mystery, there are still plenty of secrets for her to discover around Haven Springs. The seeds of these side stories are planted through clever foreshadowing and hints for the curious among us, and their revelations always felt rewarding to me. There are even optional stories that happen in each episode where Alex can use her abilities to help people, such as helping a man guess how many jelly beans are in a jar so he can win the $100 gift card to take his mom out to a nice meal, boosting a runner\u2019s self-esteem, or helping pair up a couple of friends with a mutual attraction to one another but were too scared to make a move. Even among the core cast of characters, in my first few playthroughs, there was always something new I could learn about them that allowed me the opportunity to form a better bond with them. Here's what we thought of the final episode of Life is Strange: Life Is Strange \u2014 Episode 5: Polarized is a fascinating exploration of a teenager deeply affected by loss, trauma, suffering, and failure. This is not the coming-of-age story Life Is Strange pretended to be early on, though. Polarized is destructive, unquestionably the bleak climax of the murder mystery that\u2019s been dormant during most episodes, and it only somewhat works by the time Max Caulfield arrives to her ending. It\u2019s disappointing to see Life Is Strange lean into its angrier story threads to complete its otherwise-touching human story, but its emotional closure and character resolutions make this a more memorable ending than its unnecessarily dark plot twists. - Mitch Dyer, October 21, 2015 Score: 6.5 Read the Life is Strange Episode 5: Polarized Review Deck Nine also far outshines Dontnod in the romance department, with two strong options that Alex can pursue in Ryan and Steph. In previous Life is Strange games, especially Dontnod\u2019s (Life is Strange 1 & 2), you had the option to romance either a male or female character and choose the protagonist\u2019s sexuality, but I found those games to have lackluster options. Yes, that decision is a small piece of a much larger puzzle, but when I look back at them, Dontod\u2019s poor writing always offered a strong bias towards one potential partner over the other. By comparison, Deck Nine offers an equal playing field to both Ryan and Steph, and when I played the first four chapters for the first time I was unsure who I wanted Alex to be with \u2013 or whether to choose one of them at all since you\u2019re given the ability to opt-out of romance altogether. Both characters have their pros and cons and it\u2019s quite clear Deck Nine is placing the ball in your court, and neither feels like they are getting the short end of the stick."

        "Content": "The first thing we see in Virginia\u2019s opening shot is a woman sliding a key into a locked box. The camera cuts away before we get to see what\u2019s inside, gracefully setting the tone for the haunting, enigmatic tale to follow. What\u2019s most impressive about the interactive story that unfolds across Virginia\u2019s emotionally compelling two hours is the depth of character and absorbing mystery it builds without a single line of dialogue. While there were times I wished I could break away from my limited role in its story, Virginia\u2019s soaring symphonic score and brisk cinematic pace are so dense with drama that I was usually happy to play my part just to get the next piece of this beautifully crafted narrative puzzle. Virginia is full of small, emotionally substantial moments. \u201c Virginia is told from the perspective of newly minted FBI Agent Anne Tarver, an ambitious rookie plagued by nightmares about her career and a recent loss in the family. Tarver is easily controlled in the first-person, with either a typical keyboard and mouse setup or just the mouse, with left-click to interact and right-click to conveniently walk forward. This is the extent of your control in this interactive story, which essentially has you acting out linear roles in scenes punctuated by clean cinematic cuts. It\u2019s easy to pick up and dive right into, though there\u2019s a strange motion blur effect that my GTX 760 didn\u2019t like, creating some annoying input lag. Reducing settings to medium resolved that (without much sacrifice considering the low-poly art style still looks good on medium settings), as did playing on a GTX 980. But even with the lag, I soon found myself so engrossed by Tarver\u2019s journey to the small town of Kingdom, Virginia that I hardly noticed. On her first day at the FBI, Tarver is partnered up with the secretive, stone-faced Maria Halperin to investigate a missing persons case, but also given a confidential directive from Internal Affairs to monitor Agent Halperin on the side. This sets Tarver and Halperin\u2019s tense partnership into motion, giving every subtle, wordless gesture and awkward interaction between the two an exciting importance. Details carry so much weight that missing a single second can be like skipping an entire cutscene. \u201c Virginia is full of small, emotionally substantial moments like this; scenes that illustrate the tone of every action through smart body language and music rather than dialogue or exposition. Something as small as a sideways glance speaks volumes, heightening my awareness of its story\u2019s most minute details and demanding my attention in a way that made investigating the tiny, secretive town of Kingdom that much more engaging. The music (performed beautifully by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra) is gorgeous, memorable, and often enough to carry or accompany the emotional weight of a scene in combination with its quieter elements. In one scene, you wander into the dark, cobwebbed hallways of the FBI\u2019s headquarters trying to find Halperin\u2019s office, only to be greeted with an unimpressed glare and the cold shoulder from your strange new partner. Halperin will impatiently switch off the radio in her car if you try to turn it on, and make a prominent display of dining and dashing at a small-town cafe, leaving you, the pitiful rookie, with the bill. But despite her coldness towards you she also has a lot going on inside that makes her more than the cool, uncaring partner \u2014 she wears a cherished locket with an unidentified woman\u2019s photo inside, entrusts you with her wedding ring during a mid-week visit to a bar, and lets you crash on her couch after a night of drinking beers on the water tower overlooking the town. In the morning, she cooks you two eggs and herself just one. Watching Tarver and Halperin\u2019s friendship develop under the strain of an unsolved mystery and the looming possibility of your betrayal is one of the more riveting stories I\u2019ve experienced in a game this year. I\u2019m still reflecting on its haunting conclusion a week later. \u201c Virginia\u2019s nuanced storytelling extends beyond just the relationship between Halperin and Tarver. A stick of lipstick tossed bitterly into the trash, two separate beds in a married couple\u2019s bedroom, a father refusing to hug his son \u2014 details carry so much weight that missing a single second can be like skipping an entire cutscene or tearing a page from a book. Every little thing is deliberate and demands contemplation. This all culminates in an emotionally climactic ending that delivers satisfying answers to some questions, but also raises a few new ones, demanding I return to it twice as observant as before. Three complete playthroughs later I find myself still dwelling on even its most unassuming mysteries as I try to fully piece together the latter half of its increasingly surreal story. Multiple playthroughs is easy thanks to Virginia\u2019s brisk pace and option to skip ahead to any one of its 41 chapters. It\u2019s a story you can complete in under two hours if you don\u2019t take it slow, though if you do choose to there are a number of collectable feathers and flowers scattered around certain scenes that give additional incentive to replay. While I had fun collecting them, I found that the frantic pixel-hunting required to track them down felt at odds with the somber tone or carefully crafted flow of most scenes. The story itself is enough of a reward for making a return visit. Despite each scene being very carefully put together and paced out, there were a few times where I wished I\u2019d had just a bit more freedom as Agent Tarver. Left-clicking the right objects or simply navigating to the correct location at the right time moves each scene forward in a strictly linear fashion, similar to interactive stories like Firewatch or Thirty Flights of Loving. This suits its snappier scenes well, where Tarver is fixed in place in a car or sifting through records in an FBI database. Virginia shows instead of tells. \u201c But in sections without this pre-existing momentum or urgency, where I was given time and space to wander and explore on my own accord, I found myself gravitating to things I couldn\u2019t do anything with. I wanted to put my hand on the shoulder of the mother whose son was missing. I wanted to explore my messy apartment \u2014 still full of moving boxes and adorned with beer bottle vases for the flowers I\u2019d collected around town \u2014 and see if there was something I could learn about Tarver that wasn\u2019t of immediate importance. In the end, though, my impact or interference in the story Virginia wanted to tell mattered less to me than the beautiful, ambiguous, and haunting conclusion it builds up to, which I\u2019m still left reflecting on almost a week later."

        "Content": "Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII takes the kitchen-sink approach in its attempt to cap off Square\u2019s trilogy on a strong note. It wisely throws away the battle system and locations of the previous games in favor of fresh and more interesting mechanics and settings. It also presents a slew of new ideas to the series that call back to everything from classic JRPGs to Skyrim and Majora\u2019s Mask, and even Assassin\u2019s Creed. But in its attempt to kick things up for the final act, Lightning Returns stumbles in its storytelling. Instead of going out with a bang, it sadly ends the trilogy with an muddled and tonally inconsistent whimper.  The best thing about my 30-hour odyssey with Lightning is its refreshing new take on the battle system. Any fears I had that having only one party member and a newfound emphasis on action would diminish the experience were completely gone in the first 30 minutes. Though Lightning stands alone front and center in most fights, Square wisely captures the spirit of classic RPGs by allowing you to equip and customize a trio of Schemata, which each act like a different party member. Each form has its own unique look, attacks, and ATB meter, all of which are incredibly customizable.   Every hour or so I\u2019d find myself sifting through my new loot, creating new Schemata, and experimenting with all sorts of different combinations of roles. As someone who loves tweaking minutia and comparing stats, Lightning Returns did a great job of empowering me to create a battle trio that felt unique and personal.  But despite great battles, they're arguably less important than they've ever been in the series. You don't earn XP and level up through combat, only by completing quests. These range from story-based encounters with classic characters, to countless boring fetch-quests that make me feel like I was stuck in the opening hours of an MMO. If a quest's goal wasn\u2019t combat-related, I found myself avoiding combat, the thing I enjoyed most about Lightning Returns, in favor of making a beeline for the goal that would level me up faster.  The monotony of many of these objectives is counteracted partially by just how visually interesting and varied everything is. Lightning Returns almost immediately lets you off the leash and lets you visit pretty much any of the great-looking and varied locations in the entire world. There are sprawling deserts filled with monsters that will squash low-level characters; Lush greenlands rife for exploration on Chocobo-back; and massive cities brimming with life in the midst of an End of the World party. The world cycles through day and night, and the environments genuinely feel different at different times of the day. Streets are filled with shopkeepers during the day, stronger enemies appear at night, and certain quests can only be discovered close to dawn. There's a sense of urgency in the world of Lightning Returns that I really enjoy.   Sadly, the urgency of the world doesn't quite transfer over to the characters themselves. Lightning has always been a rather stoic cypher, but this time around she\u2019s downright unlikable. Her religious crusade has caused her to lose touch with humanity, which is evident through her interactions with other characters on both a narrative and technical level. The writing for main story quests is drenched in uninteresting pathos that failed to give me a reason to care about these characters that I\u2019ve spent well over 100 hours with. Lightning\u2019s trip around the world tries to provide closure to every single one of her prior relationships, but fails to do any of it in an interesting or rewarding manner.  It generally follows this pattern: you meet an old friend who\u2019s become evil for some reason or another, either fight them or complete a fetch quest in their honor, and then kiss and make up. Any life or levity that once existed in characters like Snow or Sazh is nowhere to be found. Lightning Returns seems to have forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place. What\u2019s even worse is that most of the many hours of dialogue are technically flawed in their staging and editing. Characters are often seen facing away from the person they\u2019re talking to, back and forths feel disjointed, and every NPC feels like they got dressed in the dark. The levity here is found in ample side quests such as this. Sadly, most of Lightning Returns\u2019 attempts at humor or anything light-spirited fall flat and just come off as weird. There\u2019s also a really strange disconnect between the randomness of the side quests and the emotional desolation of the main story that makes the act of playing feel sort of jarring. I guess it makes sense when you factor in how different each part of the trilogy feels compared to the others, but I was never able to quite grasp what tone Lightning Returns was going for."

        "Content": "It would be obvious to refer to Observation as \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey: The Game\u201d. In fact, that's how developer No Code has described it itself. But in truth, this sci-fi thriller melds so much more than that together: Alien\u2019s constant sense of dread and labyrinth of claustrophobic corridors; Solaris\u2019 emotional core and haunting ethereality; and Interstellar\u2019s sheer desperation and explosive moments. All of these combine to create a gripping story that\u2019s threaded around a series of cleverly designed puzzles to create a truly unique gaming experience. Observation casts you as SAM (Systems Administration and Maintenance), the omnipresent AI of the titular space station. First impressions suggest that the station is abandoned apart from its lone occupant, Dr. Emma Fisher. It quickly becomes apparent something extraterrestrial has been at work, and figuring out what has happened is your first step. It\u2019s a captivating setup, as you endeavour to find out how your mission has taken a turn for the worse. Almost every meaningful interaction comes through the UI. Doors aren\u2019t unlocked by hand, but in system menus. Extractor fans aren\u2019t flicked on at a switch, but operated by creating a system link from a nearby camera. This is perhaps unsurprising as Jon McKellan, Observation\u2019s director, was the chief UI designer for Alien: Isolation, but those concepts have been expanded upon here, with slick text displays where many of the objectives are tackled. Almost every meaningful interaction comes through the UI. \u201c The method for solving each puzzle is provided as a scanned document or analysed schematics obtained while exploring the environment. It\u2019s then up to you to work out the specific solution to the task, using everything you\u2019ve learned while steadily drip-feeding new ideas into your memory, in many ways mimicking how an AI learns over time. It\u2019s a storytelling mechanic, too: as you find new technical information around the space station, gaps in SAM\u2019s memory core start to fill. While the plot is intriguing, and drives Observation along on at a good pace, there\u2019s plenty of calm amid the chaos. You are encouraged to explore each of the station\u2019s former inhabitants\u2019 living spaces to find out more about them and their lives, leading to quiet moments of smaller scale drama. Imagine being able to hit the pause button on the Nostromo and comb through Kane\u2019s diary \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of backstory insight you get from these documents and voice recordings. All of these intertwining personal stories and relationships layer on top of each other to help build atmosphere, which is something Observation offers in abundance.  No Code\u2019s previous outing, Stories Untold is rooted in atmosphere and Observation is no different, stepping things up in the visual department to aid that feeling. The snaking corridors are dressed in glistening metal and glossy plastics. Designs and blueprints of the ISS (International Space Station) currently orbiting our Earth have been pored over in the creation of the Observation, and it really shows. The level of detail is astounding, managing to balance the hard-edged, clinical nature of the vessel with lived-in human touches. Clothing and equipment float against the pearly white walls that mirror the central clash of man versus machine. The level of detail is astounding, managing to balance the hard-edged, clinical nature of the vessel with lived-in human touches. \u201c The sound design is exquisite. The clanging of distant metal and perpetual hum of machinery is punctuated with stabbing moments of bruising, electronic cacophony. The title credits are soundtracked by a superb pulsating score composed by Nine Inch Nail\u2019s Robin Finck. The cast of characters are voiced solidly as a whole, but the leads are truly the standouts. Kezia Burrows\u2019 believable and emotive performance as Emma Fisher contrasts beautifully with the voice of SAM - Anthony Howell\u2019s performance is deeply (and purposefully) reminiscent of 2001\u2019s H.A.L - and I found myself triggering extra voice lines just to hear interactions between them. One area of presentation that doesn\u2019t quite stand up to the standard of fidelity Observation sets elsewhere is the human character modelling. Lip syncing isn\u2019t quite up to scratch and looking into Dr. Fisher\u2019s eyes occasionally feels like staring into a black hole. It\u2019s a shame the fear and desperation so often conveyed in her dialogue are rarely, if ever, displayed on her face. Similarly, characters can look stiff moving through the environment, clashing with the polished look of the station\u2019s interior design. Thankfully, it\u2019s an issue that doesn\u2019t occur too often - you interact far more with the station\u2019s systems than the human life that occupies the spaces in between. There are a variety of observation tools at your disposal, from dozens of CCTV-like cameras placed around each of the station\u2019s many modules to the more liberating drone spheres SAM can possess. These enable you to explore more freely, even outside of the ship, and to float around its expansive exterior. The space station is an overwhelming beast at first, especially when it first opens up after the tutorial, but it soon becomes familiar and I found I wasn\u2019t relying on the map as much as I progressed through the six-hour campaign. However, there were times when found myself getting a little disoriented, especially when probing around the outside of the vessel, where no map is available. An early moment took me far longer than it probably should as I spun myself in the wrong direction and lost my bearings while trying find a damaged part of the station. Think of it more like building a piece of furniture as opposed to completing a crossword. \u201c While the scope of infinite space provides its backdrop, the focus of Observation\u2019s puzzles is relatively small in scale, but they are nevertheless engaging. It brilliantly succeeds at morphing what could easily be dull, scientifically grounded tasks into cerebrally pleasing puzzles. These range from testing your memory when attempting communication to racing against the clock to input all of the correct commands when dealing with a fire. Although few present much of a challenge, they\u2019re undoubtedly effective at making you feel a participant in the story as opposed to an onlooker. Think of it more like building a piece of furniture as opposed to completing a crossword. But what\u2019s clever about Observation is the thought process for even a simple task is more complex than you\u2019ll find in most games. Take operating a hatch. As SAM, you must first find a laptop before creating a connection to it. Next, you must obtain the hatch schematic for that specific part of the station before interacting with the hatch controls. This isn\u2019t straightforward either - each action you\u2019re able to perform has a corresponding pattern, which you must input on a 10x10 grid to execute. It\u2019s drawn out but consistently captivating, transforming what could otherwise be a simple gameplay process into something more involved. Observation Screenshots 8 Images You\u2019re encouraged to explore SAM\u2019s OS and become familiar with how to tackle each of these simple problems, and I found myself becoming more efficient each time I encountered one. A minor gripe is the complexity of puzzles never really scaled with the heightened stakes of the story as it progressed towards its conclusion. I never really got stuck on a problem for any length of time, and it\u2019s a little underwhelming to find yourself doing puzzles at the end that are so similar to what you did at the start. This isn\u2019t necessarily to the detriment of Observation overall, though, as it\u2019s the compelling storytelling that ultimately shines through. So many high-concept science-fiction stories stumble trying to provide a satisfying ending to an ever-changing plot. While some thought Stories Untold, suffered from a rather heavy-handed conclusion, Observation\u2019s finale is elegant. The last 20 minutes bring together everything you\u2019ve seen and learned in an emotionally grounded, visually spectacular denouement."

        "Content": "Mass Effect is one of my favorite games of the past decade. Despite its technical shortcomings, BioWare's first in what it promised to be a trilogy took the role-playing genre to new cinematic heights. Mass Effect 2 is a better game in near every way. From the very first scene, you will be hooked. And the farther you dive into this epic action role-playing game, the better it gets. It fulfills the promise of its predecessor while continuing to push the boundaries of what we should expect in a videogame. This is the continued saga of Commander Shepard. It's the future, and all sentient life across the galaxy is in peril. An advanced race of machines known as Reapers is intent on wiping the slate clean. Shepard, a distinguished soldier, has faced this threat and emerged triumphant once, but victory is far from assured. Now Shepard must take the fight to the enemy -- a mission that is dubbed suicidal from the outset. Things don't look very promising, but Shepard has a plan. It involves recruiting the best and brightest from around the galaxy and somehow convincing them their lives are worth sacrificing for the greater good.  Watch the video review. These heroes are what drive the story. Their motivations become yours as the experience continues to get better with each addition to the cast. Shepard's compatriots are fascinating and flawed; captivating and occasionally despicable. The arc of the main tale isn't in itself exceptional, but the characters BioWare has crafted most definitely are. These are some of the most compelling players I've ever seen in a videogame -- the Drell named Thane is a particular favorite of mine -- and the great design and writing isn't limited to the main cast. The citizens of the galaxy are extraordinary and offer more than enough reason to explore every location and talk to everybody. All of this is made even better by Mass Effect's trademark cinematic and interactive approach to conversations. With Mass Effect 1, BioWare introduced a conversation wheel that allowed for fast-moving, intriguing, and player driven cutscenes. Rather than slowly moving through conversations by selecting dialogue from a list, Mass Effect allows the player to quickly choose an emotional response, which generally include an honorable paragon reaction and a snappy renegade remark. The result is that every little dialogue snippet is about as engaging as they come. It was innovative when Mass Effect 1 first came out, and it's still so far ahead of the curve, backed up by further refinements, including a quick-time interrupt system,  and powerful voice acting. Mordin Solus, a Salarian scientist played by Michael Beattie, and Martin Sheen as the Illusive Man, are high points in an all-star cast of voices.  Watch our video roundtable for other opinions. The true strength of Mass Effect 2's story, however, is in how personal BioWare has made it. If you played Mass Effect 1 through to the end and still have your save data, this game will import your character and all the decisions you made. The central plot will not drastically change, but the experience most certainly will. Some old friends and acquaintances will return \u2013 and others won't \u2013 based on decisions you made in the last game. Even the opening moments of Mass Effect 2 can be slightly different. The actions you take in the sequel only compound this feeling of personalization. By the finale you'll have made so many decisions \u2013 ranging from simple things like whether you play as a male or female all the way up to those governing life or death \u2013 that the result is a game that is yours and yours alone. Choices you made in Mass Effect 1 come back to remind you of past good deeds or injustices. Decisions made here affect the final outcome. Reminders that everything you do will be reflected in Mass Effect 3 are everywhere, adding further drama to every conversation. Things you say and do actually matter, and that's an incredible sensation to get from a videogame. Starting New?  Whether you're new to Mass Effect or simply don't like the look of your Shepard, Mass Effect 2 gives you the opportunity to start anew. Those imported saves can change how Shepard looks. You can even pick a new character class. And everybody will start from level one.  Even if you didn't play Mass Effect 1, this game is worth playing. If you're not importing a character, BioWare simply makes some of the decisions from Mass Effect 1 for you. It's slightly less dramatic and the story here is often references events in the first game, which might make some bits less thrilling for novices. There are revelations and tantalizing plot twists that Mass Effect veterans will go crazy for. These same moments simply won't carry the same weight with those hopping in for part two. It's a bit of a Catch-22 for the designers tasked with the impossible job of pleasing newcomers while still pushing the limits. Speaking of pleasing people, BioWare listened to every last bit of criticism leveled at Mass Effect 1. That game, particularly on Xbox 360, suffered from a few technical and presentational issues. This sequel is a much, much cleaner experience. Long elevator rides and slow-loading textures are gone, replaced with (occasionally lengthy) loading screens. Generic cut-and-paste side quests and empty planets to explore have been totally ripped out. Pretty much everything that anybody took even the slightest issue with in Mass Effect 1 has been axed or rebuilt entirely.. Even though it's a cleaner production, Mass Effect 2 isn't a perfectly polished game. I've played through the game twice and during that time experienced sound cutting out, my character getting stuck in the environment and full game crashes. Thankfully, these miscues are infrequent, which allows the art style to shine. Mass Effect 2 is a visual treat, filled with breathtaking landscapes and an awesome attention to detail. If you're playing on PC and have a powerful rig (I took Shepard for a spin on an Alienware Intel Core 2 Quad 2.00 GHz prcoessor, dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260M cards, and 6 GB of memory), it will look even better.  The improvements aren't only technical. The inventory and skill systems have been made more manageable, streamlined to the point that they might initially appear too thin for a role-playing game. Keep playing, however, and you'll begin to see strength and depth emerge as you further customize your squad.  Thane is one of my favorite characters in any game. One of the biggest reasons why this streamlined approach to character customization works is the retooled character classes. The same six specialization options are back, ranging from the Jedi-inspired biotic users to the technically inclined engineer. This time, however, they've been defined and differentiated much more clearly, each getting its own set of weapon specializations and unique skills. Playing as a soldier is a vastly different combat experience compared to the vanguard or infiltrator. Each class has its own approach to battle, which is then further defined by how you choose to outfit your squad and where you assign skill points. By the end of the game, everything about Mass Effect 2 will be shaped by your choices \u2013 from the story to the ebb and flow of combat. Mass Effect 2 Guide  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Character Classes  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Game Walkthrough  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Side Quests  Of course, none of this would matter if it isn't fun to play. Good news. Mass Effect 2 is a lot of fun. The action has been refined to the point that even general fans of shooters will find a lot to like here. It's not perfect , but the game handles quite well. It doesn't take long to master simultaneously ripping off rounds from an assault rifle, tossing out a few biotic skills, and directing the two AI driven squad mates to combine raw power with smart tactics. And when things get really rough -- and they will, Mass Effect 2 is no cake walk -- you can always pull out a heavy weapon and tear the enemy a new one.  Subject Zero is one twisted hero. Add in fantastic level design and awesome skills like the vanguard's charge or the infiltrator's cloaking ability and you have one spectacular virtual playground. Mass Effect 1 toed the line by offering some of the action elements that shooter fans enjoy with some of the role-playing tactics that the hardcore fans of the genre want. The sequel improves both areas for a through-and-through satisfying battle system. On PC, the heads-up display is a bit different, custom built to work with a keyboard and mouse. Both versions are largely identical, though you will get a few more options for customizing hot keys and skill usage on the PC. Which works better for you will be a matter of personal preference. An emphasis has clearly been put on ensuring that the combat in Mass Effect 2 never grows stale. Side quests each have their own unique areas to explore -- and you'll have to explore the galactic map, talk to random characters, and find key items to even trigger many of them. The combat zones themselves, however, have been cleaned up to be more straightforward and compelling, rather than repetitive labyrinths. New gameplay twists are introduced frequently with some large quests eschewing combat entirely. There's a great focus on exploration and discovery here and BioWare has made sure that the reward for doing so is worth the effort. I love the vangaurd. "

        "Content": "Capturing the complexity of the Iranian revolution is hard to do in just two hours, but 1979 Revolution: Black Friday makes a noble and ultimately effective attempt. Thanks to an interesting cast of characters, impressive performances, and a respectful mix of drama and Telltale Games-style quick-time event action, 1979 Revolution kept me hooked all the way through and even managed to deliver an engaging history lesson along the way.  The hope, passion, danger, secrecy, and tragedy of the real Iranian revolution makes it a fascinating time and place to set a story and 1979 Revolution manages to hit on all these points in its short, but sweet two hours. It\u2019s set just days before the tragic turning point in the revolution known as the Black Friday massacre, which left several dozens of civilians dead in Tehran\u2019s Jaleh Square after the army opened fire on a crowd.  A period as tragic as it is severely misunderstood. \u201c As dissatisfaction with the Western-backed Pahlavi dynasty grew, more and more Iranians had begun taking to the streets in protest. People from all walks of life and political backgrounds joined in street demonstrations: leftists and communists, nationalists, Mujahideen, students, and more. All had different ideas for the future of Iran, but most agreed on one thing: the Shah must go. The eventual declaration of martial law and several other factors made for a period in Iran\u2019s history that was as tragic as it is severely misunderstood in the present day.   By placing such a bloody fate just over the horizon, 1979 Revolution maintained a constant sense of dread as I navigated Reza, a likable young photographer, through the streets of Tehran. Roped into a diverse circle of revolutionaries by his close friend, Babak, Reza finds himself in the midst of the revolution\u2019s most impassioned demonstrations and the sharp men and women at the forefront. His initial caution and confusion is your own as you learn to diligently navigate the heated politics and dangers of the country\u2019s civil unrest, an adventure that drew me in with the amount of careful detail put into the people and places.  I loved seeing the heart and soul of Iran, even during this tumultuous time, on full display. \u201c From the lone, banner-waving protester atop the pedestal where the Shah\u2019s statue once stood, to the mass of praying figures in the middle of a deserted street, the spirit of the revolution is rendered with much-appreciated respect for the time and place. That\u2019s true even when certain elements were clearly condensed down for the sake of encompassing as much of the historical event as possible, like representing every prominent political party with a single character, or packing a single city street with examples of protest both pacifistic and more riotous.  The Future of Iran  Despite that, I loved seeing the heart and soul of Iran, even during this tumultuous time, on full display. Half my family hails from Iran and experienced the revolution first hand, so my personal attachment to the events represented in 1979 Revolution is strong. I felt chills watching the opening credits, which juxtaposes live-action footage from the revolution against innocent home movies and in-game footage. In an opening chapter, I even recognized the bank where my grandfather used to work in Tehran \u2013 to see that kind of representation, no matter how mundane, in a medium where my culture and the Middle East at large are usually portrayed as desert war zones, was touching. But 1979 Revolution doesn\u2019t just get credit for exploring uncommon subject matter. It\u2019s the care and respect with which it treats its subjects that truly make it shine. Protesters deliver a speech during a crowded demonstration.  A personal connection to or prior knowledge of the events explored here aren\u2019t required to appreciate 1979 Revolution\u2019s story or historical backdrop, thanks to the way we\u2019re introduced to it. The photographer role is an obvious, but smart way to drop us into the middle of a complicated conflict without demanding we brush up on our history first, and that\u2019s a convenience 1979 Revolution uses to great effect.  1979 isn\u2019t afraid to dive deep into the heart of the revolution\u2019s most emotional and horrific aspects. \u201c From a city rooftop I used my camera to zoom in on a crowded street, tracing my shot over the dense gathering of civilians until the focus ring turned green. Some points of interest were less clear than others, which made locating some key photo opportunities feel like pixel hunting. But because of the amount going on in each scene, I felt compelled to look at and zoom in on as much as I could anyway, stumbling upon most of these shots incidentally. After snapping my first picture, a similar photo \u2013 a real one this time \u2013 appeared next to mine, accompanied by a caption explaining how half a million protesters marched through Tehran in September 1978. 1979 Revolution brings up real-world photos based on your in-game snapshots.  I shot more photos of striking oil workers, a homeless mother, people waving signs in support of a pro-democratic Ayatollah \u2013 each with some interesting historical or cultural fact to go along with it. Key encounters with certain characters or points of interest, from people distributing political speeches on the streets to posters of Iranian pop stars, also add extra bits of information to a handy booklet in the pause menu. If you take a few moments to read it, 1979 can deliver loads of enriching material without bombarding you with it.  Truth in Fiction  This documentary-style game doesn\u2019t just seek to educate, though. 1979 isn\u2019t afraid to dive deep into the heart of the revolution\u2019s most emotional and horrific aspects, making for a great story lead by even greater characters. But as you navigate the spirited protests, secret political meetups, and unpredictable military interventions of the revolution, 1979 maintains a respectful blend of drama and action. Even with gruesome first aid mini-games, quick-time events that depict Reza fleeing from tear gas in a crowded street, and harsh interrogation sequences set in Iran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison, the violence of the revolution is never glorified or sensationalized. A demonstration turns into a riot after the army roughs up a group of student protesters.  Smart, nuanced writing, along with some powerful performances bring even the most minor characters to life. \u201c During all of this excitement (good and bad), you also get to make plenty of choices, ranging in importance from mundane to life or death. In an early chapter, I was given the option to fight or talk down a pro-communist revolutionary, angered by the prospect of a religious Mullah leading Iran. In another chapter, I had to choose whether to throw a rock at the soldiers violently arresting Babak\u2019s friends or go the pacifist route. Later, I could confront or avoid questioning from student revolutionaries on whether or not Reza\u2019s brother was really part of the SAVAK, the Shah\u2019s infamous secret police. While compelling in the moment, many of these seemingly important decisions end up feeling inconsequential in the long run, especially in light of the rather abrupt cliffhanger ending. If 1979 Revolution receives a follow-up game, I look forward to seeing some of its loose ends tied up. Dialogue options in 1979 Revolution.  The linearity of its tale isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. 1979 has a story it wants to tell, and while it doesn\u2019t let you stray too far from the path, it does tell its story well, successfully building drama and tension in other ways. Smart, nuanced writing, along with some powerful performances bring even the most minor characters to life. 1979 can look visually rough at times, with awkwardly animated background NPCs and too many duplicate character models, threatening to pull me out of the moment as I explored this digital replication of Tehran\u2019s streets.  ...a ton of heart and surprising amounts of honesty. \u201c It ended up being the strong performances that carried the story, allowing me to look past some of 1979\u2019s more unpolished elements and indulge in what it does well, one of which is bringing a ton of heart and surprising amounts of honesty to each character. From the optimistic revolutionaries who believe in peaceful protest to an ex-Mujahideen with more violent tendencies, 1979 never once shies away from showing the good, the bad, and the ugly in everyone. It might never go too deep into the specific politics of each party, but the web of clashing character motivations and distinct personalities on display were enough to illustrate how complex and multilayered the revolution really was. This is an event that reshaped Iran forever, one with effects still being felt today, worldwide, and 1979 Revolution does it justice both on a fictional storytelling level and an educational one."

        "Content": "Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s fifth and final act launches on PC on January 28 alongside its TV Edition, which brings the entire story to PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. This review is taking a fresh look at Kentucky Route Zero as a whole now that all five acts are complete.  I couldn\u2019t stop taking screenshots as I played Kentucky Route Zero. Almost every location in this surreal adventure game could be printed out and framed on the wall as a work of art all its own, but it\u2019s the strange and twisting story that fans have been following for nearly seven years that ties them all together. That mystical story can feel appropriately mysterious at times and confusingly arbitrary at others, but it\u2019s a heartwarming journey I\u2019m very glad to have taken.  Kentucky Route Zero is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure game, but to call it that can be misleading. It\u2019s only tangentially in the same realm as classics like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango, replacing item collection and puzzle solving with reams of intimate dialogue and an impressive amount of choice in how your characters navigate every conversation.  40 of My Favorite Screenshots From Kentucky Route Zero (Visual Spoilers!) 40 Images  You begin Act 1 as Conway, a delivery truck driver trying to get to an address that seemingly doesn\u2019t exist on any map, apparently only accessible through a peculiar hidden highway called the Zero. While that simple delivery goal is your motivation through Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s five acts, Conway slowly accumulates companions along the way, each an interesting character in their own right. Their presence lets you further shape the conversations they are faced with.  Through the Eyes of Another  One of my favorite things about Kentucky Route Zero is how frequently it shakes up the way its dialogue is delivered, constantly adding to its bag of tricks. Some scenes may be straightforward conversations from a classic point-and-click side view, while others are entirely from the perspective of security guards watching your characters through security footage and discussing the scene in the past tense.  Two of my favorite scenes include an Interlude between Acts 2 and 3 where you\u2019re watching a play from the perspective of a silent actor on stage, and another later on where you control a cat as they run around and listen to your characters\u2019 conversations instead of moving those characters directly. Since Kentucky Route Zero is almost entirely about finding and then clicking through dialogue options, this endless creativity is a vital reason the roughly eight hours it took me to reach the credits stayed fresh.   That said, things certainly start simpler, with the creative storytelling increasing greatly as the campaign progresses. While Kentucky Route Zero was initially released episodically, I had never played any of it until now, and the age of its first acts is abundantly clear. Act 1 and 2 were released in 2013, and their presentation and structure can pale in comparison to the latter acts at \u2013 especially when played in 2020 after games like Night in the Woods, which clearly took a page out of this book. (It also doesn\u2019t help that Conway\u2019s leg is broken for most of both acts, causing you to move at a frustratingly slow pace.)  In a very real sense, playing Kentucky Route Zero is like taking a walk through time. \u201c  In a very real sense, playing Kentucky Route Zero is like taking a walk through time, each episode growing more ambitious and unexpected than the last. As a result, every act is delightfully surprising even when played back to back \u2013 fully hooking me around Act 3 when it starts diverging further from a standard point-and-click structure. Still, the charming characters and captivating writing kept me interested the whole time, broken leg and all.  RPG \u2013 Random Poetry Generator  One of the first tasks you are given in Kentucky Route Zero is to unlock a computer, but this simple activity sets the stage for what you\u2019ll be doing essentially the entire game. The computer\u2019s owner tells Conway the password is some poem he enters through muscle memory, comically suggesting Conway just starts typing to see what happens. No matter what lines you pick from the pre-written options, you\u2019ll always enter the right password \u2013 that\u2019s the basis of this entire adventure.   As you travel the Zero and hunt for your MacGuffin delivery address, you\u2019ll constantly be picking dialogue options for your characters, not knowing the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to any of them \u2013 as soon as you choose, your answer becomes fact and, narratively, has always been fact. These choices can be as mundane as the name of Conway\u2019s dog (my sweet old girl was named Blue) or as deep as if a character has siblings and what the context of their relationship is to them. A particularly magical moment in Act 3 has you picking the lyrics to a gorgeous song as it\u2019s sung back to you in real time, coupled with more beautiful visuals. It easily stands as one of my favorite scenes in a game in a long time.  The choices you make never really change the outcome of the plot, but they do drastically shift what story you\u2019ll hear as you progress. And once your group of weary travelers grows and offers more perspectives for you to inhabit, dialogue can change even more. Instead of just choosing Conway\u2019s responses, you can often decide which character replies \u2013 whether its Conway himself, the more forthright Shannon (your other lead protagonist and the first to join his journey), or a whimsically imaginative child named Ezra. Either option generally locks off the other responses entirely \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole novel\u2019s worth of dialogue I didn\u2019t see.  By the final act, you\u2019ll control so many people that you\u2019re effectively just having conversations with yourself. \u201c  By the final act, you\u2019ll control so many people that you\u2019re effectively just having conversations with yourself. But, somehow, Kentucky Route Zero trained me up to that point so that, miraculously, it felt entirely natural. Besides, the discussions were so often engaging and interesting that I loved picking conversation paths and marching merrily down them of my own volition \u2013 it\u2019s the same as writing poetry for a computer password without ever knowing the \u201cright\u201d answer, just on a significantly more elaborate scale.  Rocky Roads  But while Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s writing is consistently strong, the way in which it\u2019s delivered sometimes isn\u2019t \u2013 the biggest problem being an overabundance of exposition. I adored that this is a strange and mysterious tale that doesn\u2019t outright explain much of its world, but then random characters you meet briefly in a gas station would abruptly launch into their life\u2019s story in direct opposition of that style. These dumps of backstory are always well-written, just hamfistedly presented, which caused Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s already slow and deliberate pacing to stutter at times   While Kentucky Route Zero often focuses on smaller story moments like this, the larger meat of its tale is a touching one, too. I ultimately took it as a story about home, both what home actually means and how people find it, either intentionally or unexpectedly. That theme recurs throughout without being shoved in your face, and I was fully invested in Conway and Shannon\u2019s journey whether I tried to read deeper into it or not.  The folk that join them along the way are worth getting attached to, as well, particularly Junebug and Johnny the musical duo \u2013 who are robots, I guess? \u2013 even if how or why any of these people start following you is never really justified. A couple of the big character moments were similarly under-explained and seemed frustratingly avoidable from the perspective of an onlooker \u2013 this certainly didn\u2019t happen often, but sometimes I wished for the level of control Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s constant dialogue choices make it feel like you have. Without spoiling anything, a few of the threads of key characters are left unsatisfyingly hanging by the time the credits roll, too.  The end of this seven-year story is really quite lovely. \u201c  This isn\u2019t really a story that wants (or even needs) to tie up all of those threads, and thankfully for the most part that works in its favor. Apart from that handful of incongruous disappointments, the end of this seven-year story was really quite lovely, leaning into many of Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s strengths without ruining the wonder at its heart with over explanation \u2013 a fate likely worse than the smaller missteps it did make along the way."

        "Content": "If the first episode of Telltale\u2019s Batman series introduced us to the different sides of Bruce Wayne - the brutal vigilante, the billionaire socialite, and the soon-to-be World\u2019s Greatest Detective - then Episode Two, titled Children of Arkham, explores how these parts come together. In doing so it delivers some wonderfully shocking moments and sets up an intriguing new adventure for the Dark Knight.  Despite being roughly half an hour shorter than the first episode (which is two hours long) Episode Two surpasses its predecessor Realm of Shadows in terms of character development and storytelling. While the new antagonists, the eponymous Children of Arkham, are an intriguing new foil to the Caped Crusader, they don't appear until late in the episode and won't be truly captivating until more of their plan is revealed in future episodes. As with any good Batman story, it's ultimately the ghosts of Bruce Wayne\u2019s past that make this installment a compelling continuation of the Telltale series. Keeping things vague to avoid too many spoilers, this installment focuses on whether Bruce can accept what may or may not be a disturbing truth about his family, which leads to iconic figures from the Batman lore being shown in very different, much more interesting light.   The way Children of Arkham\u2019s story confounds my expectations of events as a long-time Bat-fan is its most alluring quality. While I still fully expect certain aspects of the Batman canon to exist in this new version of Gotham \u2013 Harvey Dent and Selina Kyle are main characters, after all \u2013 the alterations to established lore we\u2019ve already seen inspire confidence in Telltale\u2019s ability to offer new takes on DC\u2019s well-known characters and stories. The writers do a stellar job of taking the Bat-truths I hold to be self-evident, crumpling them up, and tossing them into a flaming dumpster in favor of something potentially just as interesting. It\u2019s much easier to empathize with Bruce\u2019s shock, anger, or sorrow since I, too, was left stunned when a familiar character is cast aside, or revealed to be anything but familiar.  The only downside to this is that I feel that if I had no previous knowledge of the Caped Crusader and his gallery of sidekicks and rogues, these moments might fall somewhat flat. The writing is smart and the entire episode avoids the somewhat sluggish pacing of the series\u2019 previous installment, but if you strip away the Batman mythos from the plot, some of its moments become fairly predictable. Telltale is clearly banking on our pre-existing knowledge of BatLore to let the full impact of its story land, but considering that there have been four number-one box office movies in the past decade and some version of him on TV since the early \u201890s, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to assume that we would have a basic understanding of the source material. And if, by some modern miracle one doesn\u2019t have the slightest clue who Bruce Wayne is, the best moments of this episode revolve around his relationships with his friends and family \u2013 things that anyone can relate to.   It\u2019s these more intimate moments \u2013 and how they affect our larger decisions throughout the episode \u2013 that reinforce the idea of Wayne and his alter-ego as one cohesive character, as opposed to two sides to the same coin. Instead, the two personas are reconciled as different tools at one man\u2019s disposal, and we\u2019re given a choice of using either Bruce\u2019s political savvy and personal touch or Batman\u2019s heavy-handed intimidation tactics to uncover the next piece of the puzzle. While we\u2019re only offered one such scenario in this particular episode, that option offers two distinctly different experiences, and each one provides different information depending on how each sequence plays out. As the Dark Knight I bashed down the doors and pummeled some basic information out of my target before security showed up, but Bruce Wayne was able to coax extra helpful contextual details out of his quarry with some old-fashioned, non-violent charm.  When you do choose the vigilante route, however, this episode features some of Telltale\u2019s best action yet, even if it does suffer from the same noticeable framerate drops or audio hiccups that seem to plague the their more intricate cinematic sequences. Still, the QTE sequences are an enjoyable break from conversation, and one bar fight in particular reminded me just how satisfying completing a well-directed quick-time sequence can be.    What\u2019s even more impressive is that while most modern Batman stories lean on the idea that the Dark Knight only wears Bruce Wayne\u2019s persona as a mask to carry on his vigilante crusade under cover of daylight, this episode had me thinking of the man inside the cowl only as \u201cBruce\u201d rather than Batman \u2013 a first in recent memory \u2013 and this sentiment carries over into some unexpectedly poignant interactions between Bruce and the supporting cast. Exploring how the allegations against his family affects his relationship with Alfred, or how the ensuing scandal \u2013 and Bruce\u2019s budding infatuation with Selina Kyle \u2013 could potentially redefine or ruin his friendship with Harvey Dent, puts all of the focus on Bruce instead of the Bat. Given the hallmark Batman moments that may (or may not, depending on how you play) be yet to come, adding these extra levels of emotional investment makes for a more compelling tale. Even though I\u2019m familiar with how certain events could play out, I\u2019m genuinely eager for the next episode to arrive and continue it\u2019s unique blend of old and new.

        "Content": "[Editor's Note: This review was written prior to the announcement that the developer, Telltale Games, has effectively closed down as of Friday, September 21, 2018. While there is no official confirmation as of this writing, it is highly likely that this will be the final episode of Telltale's The Walking Dead, even though a four-episode run had initially been announced.]  Halfway through the second episode of The Walking Dead\u2019s final season, I found myself frustrated. I had been playing for about an hour but still struggled to care about any character other than Clementine or AJ, any actions I took, or any dialogue choice I was presented with. It all felt hollow and lifeless, a formulaic Mad Libs-esque construction in which story elements were strung together in a repetitive, predictable sequence. If anything can be said for Episode Two, it\u2019s this: the seams of this series are showing, and they\u2019re beginning to wear thin.  As in previous episodes and seasons of The Walking Dead, Clementine and her relationship with AJ continues to be the strongest and most compelling part of the story. After dealing with a particularly traumatic incident at the end of the previous episode, Clementine is left to put the pieces back together and teach AJ more difficult lessons about the subtleties and nuances of life from a time when manners and niceties were socially relevant.   The blunt and confused nature of AJ\u2019s dialog feels very authentic to the way children normally speak in its ability to withhold nothing and bluntly address a topic on their immature minds. He asks Clementine why people bother having funerals, why people should care about remembering the lives of so-called \u201cmonsters,\u201d why it\u2019s okay to kill in some instances but not in others, and, in one particularly wrenching moment, whether or not they\u2019ll even continue to survive.  The rest of the supporting cast struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. \u201c Clementine\u2019s reactions are mostly genuine and well-executed. His questions hit a note deeper in her, forcing her to reconsider her beliefs and whether or not they\u2019re still necessary in this deceased world. It\u2019s a familiar sensation for anyone who has been asked an unintentionally devastating existential question by a child, and Clementine and AJ\u2019s interactions and reliance on each other remain a very solid backbone on which this season is built.  However, the rest of the supporting cast and storyline struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. This entire episode made one jarring logical leap after another, relying on the emotions and interactions of characters I barely knew to carry the drama and tension throughout, and that simply didn\u2019t work.   One particularly egregious moment happened when the other kids grew upset with AJ for an action that seemed to be reasonable and appropriate given the circumstance. Despite monumental evidence to support AJ\u2019s decision, a handful of characters instead doubled down on their irrational hatred of him, which made them even harder to identify with.  Telltale hasn\u2019t done the work of establishing motivations. \u201c It\u2019s in moments like this where the formulaic nature of The Walking Dead\u2019s storytelling begins to show. It feels templatized; time and time again, one character is inserted as the antagonist, while another stands up for Clem and AJ. Then Clementine has to choose how she reacts and is either rewarded or punished, depending on how that dialogue choice is received. That can work when characters have rational reasons to believe what they do, but here Telltale hasn\u2019t done the work of establishing their motivations, so characters instead feel like they\u2019re going through the motions for the sake of continuing the plot.  At a pivotal moment, AJ and Clementine are forced to take to the road by themselves. This goes predictably poorly and results in a contrived reunion between Clementine and a familiar face from seasons past, but their behavior here feels wildly out of character. Drama ensues, and AJ and Clem return to the compound as though they\u2019d never left, which makes no sense given the circumstances of their departure earlier in this same episode.   Moments like these were especially jarring because they don\u2019t line up with the logic the series has established (namely \u201cThis person will remember that\u201d), and they negate all of the decisions and consequences made up to this point. More characters materialized who, prior to these moments, had not been an important focus for the story but suddenly became relevant to serve as plot vehicles in their very specific place within the plot\u2019s formula.  One strong moment in the episode focused on Clementine\u2019s romance with either a female or male character in the gang of kids. This kind of interaction is a first for the Walking Dead series, and the scene in which it plays out is sweet and well-executed. It\u2019s exactly what a story like this needs: a moment of true levity in which characters have an organic interaction not tethered to the typical hopeless tropes and cliches often found within end-of-the-world stories.  Gameplay felt especially slow and plodding, with brief moments of very basic action sequences mixed in with pixel-hunting around washed-out environments to collect items. Some of it works, and some of it feels frustratingly laggy and not at all satisfying. Ranged weapons are unsatisfying to use, the precise timing of quick-time events doesn\u2019t always feel clear, and even moving around in environments is laborious. It feels old and stale, like many of the mechanics have been placed merely out of obligation to The Walking Dead\u2019s broader established formula instead of enhancing the overall experience."

        "Content": "In a video game industry that often feels like it\u2019s bloating into a monolithic, unsustainable beast propped up by annual staples and once every generation blockbusters, a small silver lining is that it\u2019s still big enough for games like The Thaumaturge to exist. This mid-size RPG may not match the jaw-dropping scale of a game like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 , but it\u2019s still packed with atmosphere and good ideas that are mostly well executed. Aside from some buggy movement and odd voices, the turn-based combat is full of interesting strategic choices, and its great writing and story manage to punch up tried and true point-and-click clue finding and lore gathering. You play as the eponymous Thaumaturge, a sort of Witcher / John Constantine mash up of a supernaturally gifted human and an extraplanar detective named Wiktor. His journey to uncover the circumstances of his father\u2019s death often finds him plying his esoteric trade both in service of this goal, and as a distraction from it. The various intertwining stories of a Poland at the brink of revolution, as well as Wiktor discovering all the ways things have changed at home in his fifteen year absence, tie a compelling narrative knot across its 20 hour run time. The Thaumaturge Gameplay Screenshots 55 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Though I found a lot of its main and side stories to be interesting, the slow pace does mean you\u2019ll spend long stretches of time reading and listening before being given a chance to act. When you do, usually through dialogue options that can vary based on past choices or your own abilities, sometimes The Thaumaturge asked me to make assumptions about Wiktor\u2019s life and old relationships that I had no context for. For instance, it regularly asks you to either be nice or a jerk to people who apparently know him, but doesn\u2019t give you adequate reason to decide one way or the other. The voice acting can also be a bit shaky, with accents that are all over the place \u2013 more than one person that is supposed to be a native to the region sounded like I could have met them in a Wawa here in the great state of New Jersey. That said, I did like that dialogue options regularly felt risky, and limitations imposed by previous encounters or Wiktor\u2019s current stats made chatting people up feel like a challenge. I can\u2019t speak to how differently any of these exchanges would go if I chose some other option, or how long it would take to reach the consequences of those choices, but The Thaumaturge at least puts on a convincing show of giving you meaningful control over its events. The good writing that accompanies clues adds some heightened drama. \u201c Quests involve a lot of snooping around, investigating objects both mundane and magical in private and in public, all to earn \u201cobservations,\u201d which are clues you can draw about the people who interacted with them based on any lingering emotional residue. The lingering lust on bedsheets or wily chaos on a stray bullet stuck in a wall can help you draw conclusions about the people who were involved with these things. Even though this largely means using your perception to investigate glowing objects in a more mystical version of Batman\u2019s detective mode, the particularly good writing that accompanies the clues does add some heightened drama as you work to put all the pieces together in your head before The Thaumaturge puts a giant neon sign on the right answers for you. Turn of the 20th century Europe is a comfortable setting for all this political drama and magical intrigue. The Russian imperial expansion into Poland, and the latter\u2019s revolution against the intruders, is thick with the kind of tension only a ghost skeleton with a Cavalry saber can cut. The constant push and pull between the occupiers and the increasingly more disgruntled citizens is something Wiktor\u2019s supernatural adventure is constantly butting up against, and it really helps keep this story grounded and relatable even when things get dense with lore and macguffins, which is a hallmark of good science fiction.

Answer See Results I\u2019m not an expert in the period, so when I say everything looks the part \u2013 from the hairstyles to the clothing to the architecture \u2013 just know it\u2019s coming from a guy who\u2019s seen Doctor Zhivago once and thought it was fine. It\u2019s not groundbreaking in its fidelity, but colors, textures, and lighting are pretty good looking at their best. Moving around Poland is sometimes a little glitchy , but it\u2019s a city that is dense with people to speak to and stuff to find that I was excited to explore. Warsaw is filled to the brim with folk who\u2019d rather you and your brethren be dead or maimed than in their business, and luckily when combat does break out, you aren\u2019t alone. Salutors, the spiritual beings that haunt the people and places of the world, can be tamed to assist you. Each has their own strengths and types, which can be used against certain kinds of enemy weaknesses, Pokemon -style. Among my go-tos were Bukavac, a snarling beast who is great at applying negative states to enemies, or Lelek, a chaotic bird demon who can drive enemies mad. Combat is never boring, but it\u2019s not particularly challenging, either. \u201c Weaving Wiktor and your chosen salutor\u2019s attacks together to most optimally synergize your offense never felt boring, though it\u2019s not particularly challenging, either \u2013 even on the highest difficulty, it wasn\u2019t until the very end of my adventure that the fights truly tested my brain. This is partially because all of your currently captured Salutors are available at any time to switch back and forth between, so you always have access to your enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities, but also because you get so much information about the goings on of every turn. You\u2019ll be able to plan around who\u2019s up next, what kind of attack they are going to use, and how close to death everyone is when queuing up your attacks, and while getting near perfect information in battle is a great thing, the enemies don\u2019t seem to have the same ability to make good decisions with it that I did. Enemies are 90% regular guys reskinned in different clothing or uniforms, wielding knives, clubs, guns, or even their fists. They may not be visually compelling, but most of their attacks do things more than straight damage, like adding detrimental status effects or draining your focus to open you up to big damage. Wiktor, combined with all of the potential spirits he can wrestle under his control, have quite a menu of offensive options themselves. Though many fights with these random goons seem to happen out of nowhere and for what should be easily avoidable reasons, it doesn\u2019t hurt to gain as many opportunities as possible to practice all of your potential options, as well as gain points to level up your thaumaturgy skills, which boost your stats, give you access to even more attacks, and potentially unlocks new discovery and dialogue opportunities.

Besides usually being more visually striking fights, with the added twist of having an untargetable character afflicting the battle in some way, they play out largely the same as other encounters. They do tend to be more challenging and provide satisfying punctuations to some of the campaign\u2019s more interesting side missions, but I also wish they got a little spicier, tactically, considering the enemies you get to face off against."

        "Content": "A doggedly traditional Japanese RPG in many respects, Bravely Second: End Layer is almost exactly as they used to make them in the old days. If you're of the mind that publisher Square Enix hit its peak during the 90s with the likes of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, then this is very much aimed at you. However, Bravely Second\u2019s charming sense of nostalgia can\u2019t fully make up for its failings. Whilst its turn-based battles are still engaging, and its art just as visually arresting, it tells a ridiculous and often patronizing story with lifeless, even frequently irritating voice work. It\u2019s a game that swings from providing great joy to deep disappointment without any warning and, as such, falls short of the bar set by Bravely Default. The setup is predictably straightforward, and lacks any nuance whatsoever. Pose Agnes, one of the previous game's protagonists, is kidnapped by the villainous (and subtly named) Kaiser Oblivion. It's up to you, as idealistic young knight Yew Geneolgia, to assemble a team capable of rescuing Agnes and, in the process, realign the forces of good and evil. Given that it's based in the same world, with some of the same characters and even returning locations, it does pay to have played through Bravely Default before starting the journey here. Honestly, though, even with the foundation of the first game embedded in your memory, it's a terrible plot. We've seen this all before and you've likely already got a pretty good idea in your mind about how, in general terms, it all plays out. Things are not helped by some questionable voice acting and a script that tries too hard to be funny, and fails in the process. Combat to the Rescue And yet, Bravely Second\u2019s gameplay manages to pull it out of these holes to become a mostly rewarding JRPG. The strategic and highly adaptable battle system from Bravely Default returns essentially in unaltered form, with the 'Brave' and 'Default' options setting it apart from other turn-based approaches. If you decide to Brave then you can spend multiple future turns in a single move, whilst the Default option sees you go defensive by opting to miss a turn in return for building up spare attacks to use in future. Having your healer Default regularly during boss battles, for example, tends to be a smart option as it allows you to unleash four healing spells in a single turn. Many of Bravely Second's more difficult opponents possess a single devastating attack that is capable of crippling the health of your entire party, so keeping health regeneration spells fully loaded is a good habit to fall into as quickly as possible. This system heavily rewards long-term planning, and properly punishes tactical short-sightedness. Only in a JRPG could feeding someone a poisoned treat in the heat of battle bring success. \u201c Bravely Second\u2019s contribution to the system comes from layering on further complexity with a huge number of Jobs (read: classes) to select from and use. These include classes typical of the Final Fantasy series - such as the Thief, Monk, Dark Knight, and Black and White Mages - and range to more exotic ones like the Performer and Patisserie. The former is dressed in Elvis-style threads and sings to bestow stat buffs to allies, whilst the latter can create desserts that deal negative status effects. Only in a JRPG can feeding someone a poisoned treat, in the heat of battle, bring success. Theoretically, the volume of Job opportunities should provide a sense of exhaustive diversity and limitless potential, but in reality I only ever bothered with a small handful of them. While there is an obvious advantage to having a single character become proficient in multiple areas, leveling them up requires such a big time investment that fixing each party member with a single job for life is the only way to play without Bravely Second practically taking over your entire existence. Yes, this approach means you miss out on seeing everything it has to offer, but it\u2019s easily preferable to grinding the same areas for hours to get your new Job level to a point where you can take on the next area's enemies. Wonderful World And I always wanted to get to the next area sooner rather than later, because one of Bravely Second's primary joys is found in entering a new location for the first time.  Despite the story woes, there\u2019s some excellent world-building here, with environments that allude to an engrossing history, and a potential future. The moments immediately following the game's opening narrative twist, for instance, are indicative of the developers\u2019 ability to bake a sense of drama right into the environment. The towering, pastel-shaded spires of Yew's home city punch themselves into the sky in powerful defiance against nature, their presence standing as evidence of the civilisation's power - a power undermined by evidence of an enemy infiltration and the realization that Yew and his people have been defenceless all along. If the writing were as sophisticated as the visual storytelling, then there would be far less to complain about. In 3D, these beautiful environments look even better, making this one of the few games for Nintendo's 3DS that is unquestionably improved by playing in 3D throughout. To say that the visual design is worth the price of admission alone would be a gross overstatement, but it goes a very long way towards overcoming the bland plot and characters."

        "Content": "Clementine is damaged. Emotional scarring is starting to wear on The Walking Dead\u2019s young heroine. She deals with loss, loneliness, and violence in different ways, and Season 2\u2019s premiere, \u201cAll That Remains,\u201d makes it abundantly clear that her innocence is lost. How you play determines whether or not it\u2019s forgotten, allowing you to forge an incredible new version of someone you thought you understood. The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 1 - \u201cAll That Remains\u201d centers on how you, as Clementine, survive the savagery of humanity and the ceaseless danger of the undead. More than this, \u201cAll That Remains\u201d examines how a strong, independent Clementine survives the sorrow of losing everything.  Developer Telltale Games describes The Walking Dead an \u201cinteractive adventure,\u201d as it prioritizes cinematic storytelling while deemphasizing gameplay. It handles its point-and-click formula here similarly to last time, adapting minimal visual elements from the developer\u2019s other series, The Wolf Among Us, to clean up its interface. Walking Dead also brings back its typically unstable frame rate and camera transitions, particularly on iOS devices and PlayStation Vita, as well as awkward animations and a handful of minor visual bugs. The mobile and Vita versions also feature a distracting brown border at the edge of the screen, which fades in and out during conversation. It obscures the scene and draws attention away from the characters -- a cardinal sin in a game of this nature. I still enjoy the frantic button-prompt-powered battles with zombies, exploring environments at my own pace, interacting with mundane objects, and engaging in human conversations as Clementine. Everything I\u2019m doing feels important. I just don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. The overarching story here is empty and vague, and your decisions from last season don't appear to matter much two years later. Clementine ends up in the company of an untrusting new group that finds her stranded and alone, but because everyone exists to question Clementine, we\u2019re left not knowing what anybody but Clementine wants. Pete, the group\u2019s sympathetic leader, has potential as an interesting father-figure type, but we\u2019ve seen that story before. Clementine gravitates toward Luke, a young man she can confide in about Lee, but he\u2019s never presented as anything more than a nice guy . The most interesting opportunity for potential is another young girl, oblivious to the brutality beyond her bedroom door, who wants to pal around with Clementine.  This new group of survivors \u2014 whose fascinating, strained relationships will inevitably lead to surprising conflict \u2014 don\u2019t explain much about themselves or their motivation. The main plot thread of the season is clearly a threatening character to come, but they keep their fears fairly secret right up until the abrupt ending. Whether by design or indecision, the grand scheme of where this story is going seems as lost and confused as Clementine. It\u2019s her story, though, that defines Season 2. The Walking Dead\u2019s limited objectives and light puzzle elements -- collecting supplies to treat a wound, or scavenging for food, for example -- intelligently correlate to Clementine\u2019s motivations. It affects how she handles a situation, what this group of survivors thinks of her, and which of them she\u2019ll trust. Your decisions dictate the direction of Clementine\u2019s story, and the kind of young woman she\u2019s become in Everett\u2019s absence.  From scene to scene, as Clementine\u2019s pushed farther from safety and those she trusts, \u201cAll That Remains\u201d often reaches the same impressive levels of tension and stress as any Season 1 highlight. Season 2 has already created emotionally resonant, haunting scenes powered by disturbing imagery. Brace yourself if you have a sensitive stomach. At times, the violence and gore around her borders on exploitative. The displeasure of a throat-cutting mercy kill, and seeing the detail of a screaming child\u2019s bleeding injury, are some of the most appalling moments in any of The Walking Dead\u2019s many forms. Certain scenes strike a difficult balance of effectiveness and excess, but they\u2019re eventually justifiable. The consequences of Clementine\u2019s harrowing experiences rank among the series\u2019 most remarkable, engaging character moments. It\u2019s tempting to treat Clementine as a hardened badass in moments of distress. She\u2019s growing up in a world that\u2019s wrong. She\u2019s alone, stewing in her own angst and anguish. This leads to many irresistible dialogue decisions. Some of her most satisfying conversation choices are arrogant or flat-out mean. She can also appeal to a person\u2019s humanity. It\u2019s difficult not to give someone the sad eyes to get what you want when given the option \u2014 but it begs the ethical question about which form of emotional manipulation makes you feel the least bad . Not enough games are willing to pose provocative, contemplative questions like this, and it remains what makes The Walking Dead special. Lee Everett choosing whether or not to amputate his infected arm, execute Larry, or let Ben die stand out as some of Season 1\u2019s strongest scenes. When Season 2 finishes, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll look back on \u201cAll That Remains\u201d and remember Clementine delivering cold, callous threats to a pregnant woman she\u2019s blackmailing. As a character study, \u201cAll That Remains\u201d is an exceptional exploration of a young woman\u2019s struggle to stay strong in unforgiving circumstances. I\u2019m more invested in Clementine now than I\u2019ve ever been, and I admire her believable independence and resolve. I just wish I knew what I was supposed to care about next."

        "Content": "Just as Endwalker opened with you and the crew setting sail for the distant city of Old Sharlayan, Final Fantasy XIV\u2019s Dawntrail expansion kicks off with a long cruise to a place we\u2019ve never been before. But instead of connecting with a long-referenced society, you step into an entire region no one from Eorzea knows very much about. From the outset, venturing into the Mesoamerican and Latin American-inspired land of Tural might lead you to believe that this is a summer vacation for a band of heroes that has saved entire realms from calamity. However, I can assure you that whatever you thought Dawntrail was, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the start of a new era for the MMO, and the growing pains of that transition can be apparent at times \u2013 but Dawntrail manages to prove once again why FFXIV is the standard-bearer for the Final Fantasy series. Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots 22 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask This latest expansion explores culture, family, and legacy in ways FFXIV hasn\u2019t in the past \u2013 and before long, it begins to ask questions about the lengths we\u2019ll go to preserve the things we hold dearest. On the surface, that will sound familiar to anyone who has stuck around all these years, but Dawntrail takes its own angle on these themes as to not retread well-worn territory. Instead, it offers new perspectives that, at times, hit just as hard as anything in the MMO\u2019s 14-year history. The main scenario quest (MSQ) takes you in unpredictable directions, blending its deep real-world influences with high-tech sci-fi that incorporates concepts seen in the cyberpunk genre, and then manages to weave in the Final Fantasies of yore and have it all still make sense. It takes some work to get there, however. I appreciate the groundwork Dawntrail lays in the first half of the main questline, painting such a vivid picture of Tural with all its cultural context at the forefront. Deep cuts are tucked underneath the more obvious references to the inspirations it draws from \u2013 we all know what tacos and mezcal are, but having a quest focus on the in-world cochinita pibil recipe is one example of several nice touches. From the architecture of the hub city of Tuliyollal to the vibrant environmental design of its early zones, Dawntrail wears its influences on its sleeve, naturally fitting those societies and the peoples who embody them into an already-rich fantasy world. At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise. \u201c But for as fascinating as the cultural exploration is, there\u2019s a noticeable lack of momentum in the way you experience the story, which doesn\u2019t surprise me given the nature of establishing a whole new story arc. For roughly the first half of MSQ, you travel across the lands of Tural alongside a new character named Wuk Lamat, a naive but always-optimistic female Hrothgar who has a heart of gold. She\u2019s in the middle of an anime-like tournament arc against her siblings in hopes of becoming the new Dawnservant, or ruler, of Tural. This leads you to gain an intimate connection with the region\u2019s people and bridge gaps between the seemingly disparate societies of each zone. It's structured so that you go through similar motions for very long stretches, and the story itself in the early goings is written in a way that\u2019s uncharacteristically surface-level. Not everything needs to be poetic and profound (and Dawntrail eventually gets there), but conflicts are brought up and resolved in a rather simplistic manner that isn\u2019t as powerful as the story seems to want you to feel they are. Instead, I found unraveling the complicated relationships between the siblings to be one of the highlights in the front half, which is an interesting dynamic that remains consistent throughout. Initially, I was quite surprised that Wuk Lamat is essentially the main character of Dawntrail while you, as the Warrior of Light, and your Scion friends are put in supporting roles. However, she is the link that connects you to the new region and having her as your lens while being part of her traveling band provides the necessary context as for why you\u2019re involved in the first place (other than not having much to do back in Eorzea and seeking adventure for the sake of it). I like Wuk Lamat as a character since she has the heart to carry Dawntrail\u2019s themes, but she isn\u2019t really given the depth needed to be a de facto protagonist. FFXIV hasn\u2019t really used this kind of approach to its characters before \u2013 even as the Warrior of Light, the supporting cast has always played their part in uplifting the story as a whole. The closest thing in past expansions is the Crystal Exarch from Shadowbringers , but his personality immediately shined and his impact was unmistakable whether he was on-screen or not. So, when Wuk Lamat extolls the virtues of peace without fully grasping the nuances that come with that, it tends to ring hollow. Which is your favorite Final Fantasy XIV expansion? Heavensward Stormblood Shadowbringers Endwalker Dawntrail Answer See Results With a tinge of shonen-style \u201cpower of friendship\u201d energy, Dawntrail has its heart in the right place \u2013 and although it sometimes seems superficial, it\u2019s nice to have a story that outright says that embracing our differences and engaging in an honest cultural exchange would make the world a better place, which Wuk Lamat does represents admirably. Its quest structure can sometimes be unexciting, but I\u2019m hesitant to say that FFXIV is finally showing its limitations or anything because I\u2019ve seen quests (main and optional) be truly creative within the confines of its MMO bounds over the years. Rather, it\u2019s apparent that Dawntrail\u2019s storytelling priorities mean it has a lot to get through while moving you along at a pace that tries not to drag on too much. There were a few times where I began to question what Dawntrail was really building towards. Every expansion has a sense of momentum to it right from the beginning, and this one\u2019s new start presents a challenge that FFXIV hasn\u2019t really had to face since A Realm Reborn . However, some well-designed dungeons, engaging boss fights with fresh battle mechanics, and hype moments in story-based solo instances kept me engaged and invested \u2013 and if anything, I was just happy to be along for the ride. That\u2019s also because I knew I would inevitably hit a turning point in Dawntrail, like all of FFXIV expansions tend to have \u2013 and when I got there, it left me floored with revelations that ripple throughout the MMO\u2019s long history. Michael Higham's Personal Final Fantasy Rankings To be clear, I do like every entry listed in here. See All 1 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Shadowbringers Square Enix 2 Final Fantasy VI Square 3 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Endwalker Square Enix 4 Final Fantasy VII Square 5 Final Fantasy Tactics Square 6 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Heavensward Square Enix 7 Final Fantasy VII Remake Square Enix 8 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Stormblood Square Enix 9 Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Square Enix 10 Final Fantasy IV Square The switch flipped in the second half, which ushers you into FFXIV\u2019s version of the old-timey American West. Hearing a Texan accent, let alone an American one, in FFXIV for the first time gave me whiplash on the same level as any plot twist. It\u2019s charming as hell how another piece of the real world effortlessly blends into the rest of the expansion\u2019s personality. That\u2019s also to say that what it has up its sleeve deeper in creates a stark contrast that is both conceptually and aesthetically superb. The high-tech sci-fi aspect of Dawntrail is pretty well-known in the lead up to its release \u2013 the main city of Solution Nine was revealed well beforehand, but it\u2019s the reasons for bringing you there that make for quintessential FFXIV storytelling. It goes for some wild swings, and in this second half, contains truly stunning moments I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around. It fills me with joy to be genuinely surprised by a game I thought I\u2019d known so well. Having been so invested in FFXIV for all these years and carrying many of my favorite story moments into my own life, I can\u2019t always expect it to keep reaching those highs. Yet, Dawntrail does it again \u2013 perhaps not as consistently or elegantly, but it has left a significant impact nonetheless. It questions what makes family important, asks why we harbor such resentment for those different from us, and shows what\u2019s possible when we work together. More effectively, it also builds on the questions posed in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, about how we handle loss, mortality, and the inevitable passage of time sweeping away the things we hold dear \u2013 and the uncomfortable truth that we ascribe value to life because it will end. This expansion is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities. \u201c At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise. Much of that can be attributed to the fact that certain characters I\u2019ve loved continue to grow and be voices of reason to give clarity when everything else in my life feels like utter chaos. Yes, you are venturing into new and compelling beginnings in a land foreign to the characters you\u2019ve been with for years, but Dawntrail is made stronger for the way it remembers where it came from. Part of me feels like Dawntrail conjoins two very different halves, and I often imagine the depth to which FFXIV could have explored its larger themes had it dedicated more time to one or the other. But with just enough connective tissue for its hard-hitting moments to not ring hollow, it\u2019s able to land with the same kind of impact that previous expansions have, and for its own reasons. If there\u2019s one particular theme to point toward, it\u2019s that peace isn\u2019t just the absence of war but a two-way street that must be worked for \u2013 whether that be peace in the world or the struggle for inner peace amid indelible heartbreak and tragedy. For all its shortcomings in the earlier hours, it certainly makes good on the ideas it tries to build. The way Dawntrail wields its final zone as a storytelling device, conceptually and visually, left me shocked and with my stomach in knots. The absolute onslaught of its last few dungeons had me on the edge of my seat frantically executing my attack rotation. The creative battle mechanics that even surprised me as a long-time Savage raider left me grinning as I took those Damage Down debuffs like a champ. And to have fought almost all those battles alongside my favorite characters through the Duty Support system let these gameplay sequences also shine as peaks in its storytelling. The emotional core that always ushers FFXIV\u2019s best moments is found in its music. Composer Masayoshi Soken alongside the sound team has broken new ground for the MMO, and for Final Fantasy as a series, here in Dawntrail. The Spanish and Latin American influences have been effortlessly woven into the songs that fill the new zones and towns with wonder and excitement, and the Flamenco-style battle theme is stuck in my head as I write this. The wistful melodies of the old western guitar riffs in Xak Tural standout as catchy tunes that set an unmistakable mood. Then you have synth-infused metal and trance tracks for pivotal battles that pack a punch unlike anything else in Dawntrail\u2019s eclectic soundtrack. And yes, there are some really sweet lo-fi beats to chill or study to. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the jazzy swing theme of the new hub city of Tuliyollal. Regardless of style, Soken and company create incredible music that bends, fuses, and elevates genres while consistently incorporating the classical musical themes that naturally become part of the storytelling experience \u2013 just another common W for FFXIV. Story may be at the forefront of Dawntrail\u2019s launch, but with a new expansion comes tons of new content on top \u2013 most notably the two new Jobs: Pictomancer and Viper. After leveling Pictomancer and perfecting its attack rotation full of adorable painting abilities turned destructive, it\u2019s become one of my all-time favorite expansion Jobs. Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as. It finds a middle ground between its magic DPS counterparts Black Mage and Summoner; not so complex that you\u2019ll struggle to learn but not so simple that you\u2019ll mindlessly cycle through your rotation. Popping your paintings pre-pull is an adorable visual, as is dropping Moogle poms before whipping out a magic hammer to crush your foes. It\u2019s satisfying when you line up all the cooldowns and casts while bouncing between the different spells you\u2019re expected to execute, and as of now, it sits pretty high on the DPS charts (although some tweaks are planned to mitigate certain exploits). Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as. \u201c Viper on the other hand isn\u2019t quite as exciting as I\u2019d hoped \u2013 maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve played melee DPS for most of my time in FFXIV and have stuck with Ninja through every raid tier. But in contrast to Pictomancer, it lacks that rewarding buildup and burst window, or even a distinct personality to make it stand out within a crowded field of DPS Jobs. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks cool as hell to see a Viper swap between dual swords and the double-sided blade, but when compared to Reaper (which shares similarities), the dynamic of Viper\u2019s branching attack rotation doesn\u2019t quite reach those satisfying heights. At launch, the development team even said that it\u2019ll be reworking Viper, and although it\u2019s impossible to say how that might change the core concept of the Job, there is certainly potential for it to grow into a better one. As per usual, there are two Expert-level dungeons in the post-game, both of which make good use of the more whimsical settings of Dawntrail and experiment with a few new battle mechanics. And although I\u2019m still progressing through them as of writing this, the Extreme trials currently available stretch the base-level boss fights into wild and chaotic battles. The other important piece of content worth mentioning are the role quests, which carry on the tradition of providing additional backstory based on the Jobs you have leveled up. They\u2019re not quite as defining as the ones seen in Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but they are worth seeing through and add a nice touch to tie in other parts of FFXIV. The lasting legacy of Dawntrail also lies in future patch content \u2013 the Arcadion raid series, the Beastmaster special Job, Cosmic Exploration, and all the new things the FFXIV team will roll out over the next two years. I\u2019ll be sat ready for them when they arrive, but for now, Dawntrail has earned its place in the pantheon of great expansions."

        "Content": "When the credits rolled at the end of Borderlands 2, I knew I loved it. Its exceptional writing, fun combat, constant stream of loot, fun quests and the sense of place sucked me into Pandora for hours and left me hankering for more story content. Now that we finally have more, though, in the form of Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate\u2019s Booty, it\u2019s obvious the original campaign set a high bar that\u2019ll be tough to clear. Pirate\u2019s Booty provides hours of fun for people longing for more Borderlands 2 gameplay, but the story, characters and quests feel flat compared to the core campaign. As soon as you hit level 15 you can instantly fast travel to Oasis, the starting point for the Pirate\u2019s Booty content. Doing so triggers an awesome cinematic intro where you learn about a long-lost treasure. You\u2019ll also meet Captain Scarlett, a sand pirate who you\u2019ll help in an epic quest to uncover a host of loot. The story starts off great, with hilarious and well-written characters like Shade, but quickly stumbles into mediocrity. A few quests for Shade and you basically never see him again, leaving you with a slew of other characters which, despite having occasionally witty or charming dialogue, largely never come all that close to being as engrossing or great as I\u2019ve come to expect from Borderlands. Likewise the narrative just doesn\u2019t develop into anything especially good. Captain\u2019s Booty doesn\u2019t have a lead protagonist or antagonist binding it together in the way, Handsome Jack, Angel or Lilith do in the mainline story. As such it suffers, resulting in a story that\u2019s almost entirely predictable (and at times downright boring). Archetypal stories don\u2019t need to be boring (see Star Wars, Lord of the Rings), but Captain\u2019s Booty doesn\u2019t have interesting enough characters or plot twists to make it engrossing. That being said, the last part of Pirate\u2019s Booty is almost enough to redeem it, as the final zones\u2019 story and loot payoff makes the experience feel rewarding. If all you want is a reason to get more loot, levels (assuming you haven\u2019t maxed out), and to shoot your way through more of Pandora, Captain\u2019s Booty mostly succeeds. Combat encounters remain interesting and fun despite mostly putting you up against re-skinned enemies in pirate get ups, if only because your characters abilities and weapons feel like playing with toys. The occasional unique enemy like the Anchorman helps mix things up, as his ability to yank you to him from far away kills camping strategies. I think it\u2019s good to establish a sense of place, something the DLC does as well as the original campaign with its visual design, but it\u2019d be nice to see more creativity taken with the pirate theme than just putting a captain\u2019s hat or cutlass on the host of familiar foes. Likewise there\u2019s plenty of loot to collect and quests to fulfill, though the latter doesn\u2019t live up to the quality established by core Borderlands 2 experience. You won\u2019t find any weapons or other gear in the main quest that\u2019ll blow you away, but new level 50 raid bosses, including one you can kill for a new currency called Seraph Crystals, give the most dedicated of us something to chase long after the many hours of Pirate\u2019s Booty quests run out. Not that most of the quests are particularly interesting \u2013 most of them boil down to typical MMO-like fetch and kill quests. The main campaign of Borderlands 2 had its fair share of these objectives as well, but they were peppered throughout a lengthy narrative that also had a large number of inventive and inspired quests, even better writing and a slew of fantastic characters. If you\u2019re susceptible to the more typical and generically structured quests (and I\u2019ll admit, I am), then you\u2019ll find plenty to get sucked into, even if it\u2019s a bit boring and makes you retread environments a lot more when compared to what we\u2019ve seen before.",

        "Content": "Undone by its ambitious attempt to pack four game experiences into one, Resident Evil 6 suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. At times it very much embraces its old school heritage, pitting its heroes against horrific creatures in the darkest, filthiest locales imaginable. Tension is palpable thanks to production values that reach new heights for the franchise. Yet it simultaneously attempts to be the largest, most action-packed entry in its history, betraying the aforementioned strengths. Lengthy firefights, driving sequences and other ill-conceived ideas grind the game's incredible moments to a halt. The result is something erratic and never sure of itself, delivering brilliance one moment and something far less interesting the next. At the heart of Resident Evil 6 are the game\u2019s four campaigns and seven lead characters. Rather than weaving these characters and stories along a singular campaign, Capcom diffuses them across four individual threads, each with its own beginning and end. This singular choice defines everything about this game, highlighting both its greatest accomplishments and remarkable shortcomings. Resident Evil 6\u2019s over-the-top world is built piece-by-piece through its four storylines, which cleverly integrate with each other. Questions aren\u2019t necessarily answered until the entire plot emerges through different perspectives, and the realization that the game\u2019s designers deliberately held something back to unleash it during a later campaign makes the effort of pushing through four individual campaigns worth it. It\u2019s remarkable to enter a scene, realize its place in the larger timeline, and get a payoff for something that was merely hinted at during an entirely different character arc. There\u2019s a cumulative narrative effect that occurs here, one that wouldn\u2019t be possible if Capcom chose a different path. Resident Evil 6\u2019s over-the-top world is fundamentally built through its many storylines, which cleverly integrate with each other. \u201c Every storyline in this game, through a combination of great environments, great enemies and a carefully cultivated sense of wide-eyed, B-movie horror, has situations so memorable that they\u2019ll be seared into your brain. It\u2019s hard to forget the first time you\u2019re crushed by the relentless, beastly Ustanak, or watch a creature spew out C-virus gas in a crowded area, turning dozens of trapped human survivors into flesh-eating zombies. These moments come frequently, often serving as vivid, gory reminders of the game\u2019s tense storytelling prowess. Yet the layered narrative sometimes works against the gameplay. As the campaigns cross paths, the game forces players to replay sequences - including some lengthy encounters that really ought to be played once and only once. There is nothing gained from this repetition, as the only story revelations come from cutscenes and dialogue - not in-game action. A game that thrives on the stacked benefit of multiple perspectives manages to forget how that negatively impacts the actual experience of playing through encounters repeatedly. That notion of repetition shines light on the most basic element of Resident Evil 6\u2019s biggest shortcomings \u2013 it\u2019s actually too big. Each campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. Chris\u2019s spectacular confrontation with a massive snake in a shabby Chinese apartment is preceded and interrupted by lengthy, monotonous gunfights on rooftops and a rather uninteresting fight against a helicopter. Jake and Sherry escape and engage threats by riding motorcycles and snow mobiles, making their thrilling, futile attempts to stop the Nemesis-like Ustanak significantly less rewarding. This mix of highs and lows is not only confusing, it\u2019s downright frustrating. Each campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. \u201c Early on, different types of gameplay and tones of horror are established for each campaign. When the game\u2019s design works within these core competencies, it is absolutely a great experience. The elimination of Chris\u2019s team by an overwhelming, reptilian threat. Jake and Sherry repeatedly fleeing from the Ustanak. Leon and Helena surviving the ravaged Tall Oaks or uncovering the twisted secrets of an underground laboratory. Ada attempting to solve elaborate, convoluted puzzles in the belly of a submarine. These experiences stand apart from each other while remaining true to the beating heart of the Resident Evil franchise in their own unique way. Capcom would have done itself a world of good by simply understanding these individual storylines do not exist in a vacuum and don\u2019t need to be the same in terms of volume or length. Rather than trying to force diversity into each campaign through blatantly protracted action sequences, the development teams should have understood the campaigns feel freshest if they maintain a sense of purpose. This is not the first title in the franchise to attempt \u201cnon-traditional experiences,\u201d like taking the helm of a vehicle, but by virtue of its scope, it becomes the most excessive offender. Over the past 15 years, Resident Evil has created its fear through one central tenant - you have guns and possibly allies, but the creatures you face are so powerful that none of these odd-eveners matter. The mutant and militant J\u2019avo creatures more or less throw that out the window. Suddenly you\u2019re engaging in firefights with soldiers that have machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket launchers - plus helicopters and tanks. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen some of these in a Resident Evil game, but it\u2019s never been so pervasive. The implementation of a cover system and move-and-shoot controls add to this overall shift for the franchise, making it less about its core principles and more about trying to be something it\u2019s not. This time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. \u201c The game does offer vast improvements in terms of cooperative experience - online or off. Resident Evil 5 was notorious for its vacuous AI partner system. This time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. That\u2019s not to say the system is perfect. It\u2019s not uncommon for you to issue an order only to have it ignored, or to stand waiting at a door for what feels like an eternity while your partner is seemingly missing in action. Playing with a friend, who can now drop in and out of your game at any time, will solve some of this, but once again exposes the weaknesses of Capcom\u2019s buddy-focused direction for the Resident Evil franchise. Tense or terrifying moments give way to a feeling of safety with the added company. It\u2019s hard to worry about a threat when your buddy is just around the corner to save you. Other online additions feel superficial, particularly compared to the vast scope of the core campaign. Mercenaries Mode returns, allowing \u2018skill points\u2019 earned in its time- and score-based gameplay to be applied to its own unique upgrades, or to the core campaign\u2019s. Tying the two experiences together will certainly provide some incentive to some. Agent Hunt Mode, meanwhile, allows you to take on the role of an enemy in a random online player\u2019s game, but the implementation of enemy combat and camera control is so haphazard there\u2019s little point in indulging. Some of Capcom\u2019s greatest successes are more immediately noticeable thanks to some incredibly strong world, lighting, and creature design. Outside of the return of the franchise\u2019s iconic zombies, which are a bit faster and more capable than in past iterations, Resident Evil 6 features an all-new roster of monsters. This was a bold move, one that adds a much-needed element of unpredictability to the campaigns. In fact, some of these creations - like the zombie-spawning Lepotitsa, or relentless Rasklapanje - rank among some of the best designs and concepts in the history of the franchise - no small feat for a series famous for the quality of its enemies. Atmosphere is the essence of the Resident Evil series. A powerful environment, full of detail and depth, pulls you in, creating a sense of history and life while also amplifying the emotional reaction. There\u2019s a reason settings like the Spencer Mansion from the first Resident Evil or Rapture from Bioshock prove so memorable. Those games wouldn\u2019t be nearly as powerful without those locales. In fact much of their experience relies upon them. Resident Evil 6 has no shortage of these types of great set pieces, ranging from cities under siege to dark, vast catacombs to cramped, cluttered high-rises. These aesthetics mostly succeed thanks to an emphasis on strong lighting effects. Serving as a stark contrast to Resident Evil 5\u2019s sun-soaked locales, this sequel often opts for much darker scenery, pushing the overall visual fidelity through an increased emphasis on shadows and moody illumination. The result is an experience that has an immediate impact on the player, but the increased lighting design does have some unfortunate consequences. Background objects, textures and NPCs often take a noticeable dip in quality, sometimes to the point of distraction. Yet as a whole, Resident Evil has rarely felt so alive."

        "Content": "I\u2019ve never beaten him in a fiddle contest, but I\u2019m sure glad I got to challenge Lucifer to a drinking competition in Night School Studio\u2019s second adventure game, Afterparty. The Oxenfree developers\u2019 descent into the underworld retains its formula of 2D exploration with near-constant conversation and Telltale-like dialogue choices while introducing a world of neon-soaked demonic alleyways and dive bars that look... well, like most do on Earth. But inside that over-the-top demonic shell is a deeply human, cuttingly honest, and frequently funny story about two best friends making it through one hell of a night. Afterparty\u2019s tightly knit cast allows for more personal and affecting storytelling than what we saw in Oxenfree. Milo and Lola have, surprisingly, found themselves in Hell. Believing they\u2019ve wrongly ended up surrounded by fire and brimstone for eternity, the duo ventures off to win a trip back to Earth by beating Satan in a drinking game. Should be easy enough, right? Afterparty Images 20 Images Well, nothing on Earth or in Hell is that simple, and Milo and Lola\u2019s winding night takes them through several bar-filled districts of the underworld and turns into an emotionally trying, morally complex adventure. There\u2019s an emphasis on dialogue options, as the continuous chatter often involves giving input on everything from small-scale character moments to larger, story-impacting choices. An early decision I made to help a demon instead of a human woman completely cut off a later quest for me, though thankfully Afterparty\u2019s roughly seven-hour length makes replaying to see that mission, and plenty of other paths locked behind your choices, less of a chore and more of an intriguing alternate cut. Night School\u2019s vision of Hell is bright and colorful \u2013 and not just thanks to all the lava oozing around \u2013 and each bar and district of the Underworld is intriguing to explore. From the chain sports bar\u2019s interior being garishly lit by all the HDTVs on the walls to a dingy pool hall to some surprising clubs, every interior is distinct and breathes life into the land of the dead.For a location that has been mined in plenty of pop culture, Night School\u2019s Hell feels unique, and completely like the post-bar, 2 am, dingy cityscape it\u2019s often supposed to evoke. I did run into some occasional slowdowns in the more open areas and a few infrequent clipped lines of dialogue, but never to the detriment of Afterparty\u2019s most powerful moments. And it\u2019s all backed by another impressive score by scntfc, the EDM artist who composed Oxenfree\u2019s haunting score. Balancing both thumping party beats and slow dirges, the music almost always sets the appropriate mood. Night School\u2019s Hell feels completely like the post-bar, 2 am, dingy cityscape it\u2019s often supposed to evoke. \u201c  This Is the Bad Place! Night School has done an impressive job of making its stars, Milo and Lola, clearly defined people while also allowing you to take on a level of meaningful control in their dialogue choices. Part of that is thanks to the biting, fun writing, which rolls as smoothly as if Aaron Sorkin added fast-talking kids to his repertoire. Milo and Lola are endearingly played by Khoi Dao (Detective Pikachu\u2019s Tim Goodman) and Janina Gavankar (Star Wars: Battlefront II\u2019s Iden Versio), respectively, and they quickly find a rhythm and chemistry that makes their friendship feel as lived-in as intended. They\u2019re also both great at playing with the many turns the story does and can take, depending on both planned story events and optional dialogue choices. Moments as disparate as Lola lovingly throwing jabs at her friend or Milo trying to bury his worries about where their friendship was (platonically) heading back on Earth add depth and realism to a world involving a bunch of drunk demons. Afterparty Voice Cast 9 Images And though Afterparty has a certain story to play out, the dialogue options frequently felt like they had meaningful emotional implications, and occasionally important story ones, too. It smartly plays with its sense of choice, often proving that maybe life in Hell has no purely right or purely wrong answers, especially when considering how those choices affect side characters. They may have been nice to you but they are, after all, demons.  A Lively Afterlife Afterparty plays with the notion of Hell as both a religiously informed location and one that has to operate with some sort of day-to-day society. I won\u2019t ruin any of its jokes here, but the ways it finds to add the mundanities of real life make a hellish lifestyle seem not far off from our own on Earth. And, as someone who sat through 12 years of Catholic school classes, I laughed out loud at more than a few passing religious references and subversions. Sorry, Sister Mary. Dave Fennoy's Satan is one of my favorite devils in awhile. \u201c Night School has littered the blood and rum-soaked streets of Hell with hilarious characters who show often surprising depth as the story progresses. How cabbie Sam and personal demon Wormhorn play into the story is better left as a surprise, but actors Ashley Burch and Erin Yvette, respectively, deliver both hilarious and gutting moments that had me caring for demons in a way I never would have expected to. And the less said about Dave Fennoy\u2019s wonderful portrayal of Satan the better \u2013 it\u2019s best left to be discovered. He\u2019s easily one of my favorite devils in awhile.  Pick Your Poison Night School hasn\u2019t revolutionized Oxenfree\u2019s gameplay formula with Afterparty so much as evolved it, and as a lover of story-focused adventures I enjoyed navigating Milo and Lola through Hell, while almost in constant conversation with either one another or supporting characters. Afterparty switches throughout its story to either character depending on who is the most integral to the current chapter, and constant dialogue options that appear as thought bubbles above their heads allowed me to take some sense of ownership as the story progressed. Aftaerparty often found emotionally devasting ways to tell me how I morally messed up. \u201c Twisting that formula around this time, though, is the introduction of a selection of very unfine and horrifying cocktails. Each bar in Hell \u2013 you\u2019ll visit a distinct handful \u2013 has its own menu, with drinks that liberate Milo and Lola from their inhibitions in different ways. The Literally Acid drink might allow you to say something more energetic, while a Bloody Stool will have you acting like a hopeless romantic. As in life, insightful or awkward comments can be helpful or harmful depending on who you\u2019re trying to charm, strongarm, or impress. Often, the story places you at a specific bar for a specific reason, and so the handful of drink selections provide different options for emotional states \u2013 some more obviously helpful in a given situation than others. But they almost always offer a fun alternative dialogue line. Afterparty throws a couple of minigames into the fray, with \u201cvictory\u201d just one beer pong match or dance competition away. I say \u201cvictory\u201d in quotes, though, because almost every choice in Afterparty comes with some moral complicating factors. Even when picking what I thought would give me the best outcome, or be the most honorable thing to do \u2013 which were not always the same thing \u2013 Afterparty would find devastating ways to tell me how I had messed up. Thinking I made the right choice by saving the soul of an innocent man from eternal damnation actually proved to make my, and much of the supporting cast\u2019s predicament more difficult in the endgame. Though even when it felt like I \u201cmessed up\u201d an encounter, Afterparty didn\u2019t throw me to a Game Over screen. The party keeps moving whatever choice I made, and I had to live with the consequences of that, all the way through to a satisfying ending that made my decisions feel like they had some weight to them. It has me itching to return to the world to see how else these characters\u2019 lives may have played out if I\u2019d been better at reading the room, but my first run felt like an honest and true ending to the path I often pushed Milo and Lola down. Oh, and it has one of the best cut-to-credits scenes in a game I can remember."

        "Content": "Mass Effect is one of my favorite games of the past decade. Despite its technical shortcomings, BioWare's first in what it promised to be a trilogy took the role-playing genre to new cinematic heights. Mass Effect 2 is a better game in near every way. From the very first scene, you will be hooked. And the farther you dive into this epic action role-playing game, the better it gets. It fulfills the promise of its predecessor while continuing to push the boundaries of what we should expect in a videogame. This is the continued saga of Commander Shepard. It's the future, and all sentient life across the galaxy is in peril. An advanced race of machines known as Reapers is intent on wiping the slate clean. Shepard, a distinguished soldier, has faced this threat and emerged triumphant once, but victory is far from assured. Now Shepard must take the fight to the enemy -- a mission that is dubbed suicidal from the outset. Things don't look very promising, but Shepard has a plan. It involves recruiting the best and brightest from around the galaxy and somehow convincing them their lives are worth sacrificing for the greater good.  Watch the video review. These heroes are what drive the story. Their motivations become yours as the experience continues to get better with each addition to the cast. Shepard's compatriots are fascinating and flawed; captivating and occasionally despicable. The arc of the main tale itself isn't in itself exceptional, but the characters BioWare has crafted most definitely are. These are some of the most compelling players I've ever seen in a videogame -- the Drell named Thane is a particular favorite of mine -- and the great design and writing isn't limited to the main cast. The citizens of the galaxy are extraordinary and offer more than enough reason to explore every location and talk to everybody. Collector's Edition EA and BioWare didn't stray too far from the beaten path when deciding what to include in the Collector's Edition for Mass Effect 2. At just a $10 USD premium over the standard edition, you shouldn't be expecting anything extraordinary here. If you go in with modest expectations, however, you will find a deluxe edition that contains quite a few collectible goodies. Here's a full list of what you get: Full standard edition of Mass Effect 2. 48 page hardcover mini-art book. Mass Effect Redemption #1 comic book. In-game special weapon and armor set. Making-of DVD. The package also contains a Cerberus Network activation code, as do all new copies of Mass Effect 2, which grants the owner access to a few bits of free downloadable content. So how does it all stack up? The package contains a few hits and a few misses. The special armor set includes a helmet that makes it so you can't see Shepard's face, even during cutscenes and conversations, which makes it a bit disappointing. The comic book does a good job of explaining why exactly Liara is behaving the way she is in Mass Effect 2, but you can also get a digital copy on iTunes if you'd like. The big items that fans will appreciate the most are the Making-of DVD and the art book. Since the box isn't any taller than a traditional DVD box, the art-book is relatively small. Still, fans will appreciate the high-quality concept art. The Collector's Edition DVD contains a few standard-definition behind-the-scenes videos, some trailers that you can probably find in 10 seconds on the Internet, and some nifty wallpapers that you can access by tossing the DVD into your home PC. Perhaps the nicest part of the package is the package itself. The discs come in a shiny metal case that looks quite slick. And the cover art on the Collector's Edition is far better than the standard edition box art. All told, this isn't the greatest Collector's Edition ever created, but it certainly isn't the worst. Fans with tempered expectations will find a satisfying package.  All of this is made even better by Mass Effect's trademark cinematic and interactive approach to conversations. With Mass Effect 1, BioWare introduced a conversation wheel that allowed for fast-moving, intriguing, and player driven cutscenes. Rather than slowly moving through conversations by selecting dialogue from a list, Mass Effect allows the player to quickly choose an emotional response, which generally include an honorable paragon reaction and a snappy renegade remark. The result is that every little dialogue snippet is about as engaging as they come. It was innovative when Mass Effect 1 first came out, and it's still so far ahead of the curve, backed up by further refinements, including a quick-time interrupt system,  and powerful voice acting. Mordin Solus, a Salarian scientist played by Michael Beattie, and Martin Sheen as the Illusive Man, are high points in an all-star cast of voices.  Watch our video roundtable for other opinions. The true strength of Mass Effect 2's story, however, is in how personal BioWare has made it. If you played Mass Effect 1 through to the end and still have your save data, this game will import your character and all the decisions you made. The central plot will not drastically change, but the experience most certainly will. Some old friends and acquaintances will return \u2013 and others won't \u2013 based on decisions you made in the last game. Even the opening moments of Mass Effect 2 can be slightly different. The actions you take in the sequel only compound this feeling of personalization. By the finale you'll have made so many decisions \u2013 ranging from simple things like whether you play as a male or female all the way up to those governing life or death \u2013 that the result is a game that is yours and yours alone. Choices you made in Mass Effect 1 come back to remind you of past good deeds or injustices. Decisions made here affect the final outcome. Reminders that everything you do will be reflected in Mass Effect 3 are everywhere, adding further drama to every conversation. Things you say and do actually matter, and that's an incredible sensation to get from a videogame. Starting New?  Whether you're new to Mass Effect or simply don't like the look of your Shepard, Mass Effect 2 gives you the opportunity to start anew. Those imported saves can change how Shepard looks. You can even pick a new character class. And everybody will start from level one.  Even if you didn't play Mass Effect 1, this game is worth playing. If you're not importing a character, BioWare simply makes some of the decisions from Mass Effect 1 for you. It's slightly less dramatic and the story here is often references events in the first game, which might make some bits less thrilling for novices. There are revelations and tantalizing plot twists that Mass Effect veterans will go crazy for. These same moments simply won't carry the same weight with those hopping in for part two. It's a bit of a Catch-22 for the designers tasked with the impossible job of pleasing newcomers while still pushing the limits. Speaking of pleasing people, BioWare listened to every last bit of criticism leveled at Mass Effect 1. That game, particularly on Xbox 360, suffered from a few technical and presentational issues. This sequel is a much, much cleaner experience. Long elevator rides and slow-loading textures are gone, replaced with (occasionally lengthy) loading screens. Generic cut-and-paste side quests and empty planets to explore have been totally ripped out. Pretty much everything that anybody took even the slightest issue with in Mass Effect 1 has been axed or rebuilt entirely.. Even though it's a cleaner production, Mass Effect 2 isn't a perfectly polished game. I've played through the game twice and during that time experienced sound cutting out, my character getting stuck in the environment and full game crashes. Thankfully, these miscues are infrequent, which allows the art style to shine. Mass Effect 2 is a visual treat, filled with breathtaking landscapes and an awesome attention to detail. If you're playing on PC and have a powerful rig (I took Shepard for a spin on an Alienware Intel Core 2 Quad 2.00 GHz prcoessor, dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260M cards, and 6 GB of memory), it will look even better.  The improvements aren't only technical. The inventory and skill systems have been made more manageable, streamlined to the point that they might initially appear too thin for a role-playing game. Keep playing, however, and you'll begin to see strength and depth emerge as you further customize your squad.  Thane is one of my favorite characters in any game. One of the biggest reasons why this streamlined approach to character customization works is the retooled character classes. The same six specialization options are back, ranging from the Jedi-inspired biotic users to the technically inclined engineer. This time, however, they've been defined and differentiated much more clearly, each getting its own set of weapon specializations and unique skills. Playing as a soldier is a vastly different combat experience compared to the vanguard or infiltrator. Each class has its own approach to battle, which is then further defined by how you choose to outfit your squad and where you assign skill points. By the end of the game, everything about Mass Effect 2 will be shaped by your choices \u2013 from the story to the ebb and flow of combat. Mass Effect 2 Guide  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Character Classes  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Game Walkthrough  \u00bb Mass Effect 2 Side Quests  Of course, none of this would matter if it isn't fun to play. Good news. Mass Effect 2 is a lot of fun. The action has been refined to the point that even general fans of shooters will find a lot to like here. It's not perfect , but the game handles quite well. It doesn't take long to master simultaneously ripping off rounds from an assault rifle, tossing out a few biotic skills, and directing the two AI driven squad mates to combine raw power with smart tactics. And when things get really rough -- and they will, Mass Effect 2 is no cake walk -- you can always pull out a heavy weapon and tear the enemy a new one.  Subject Zero is one twisted hero. Add in fantastic level design and awesome skills like the vanguard's charge or the infiltrator's cloaking ability and you have one spectacular virtual playground. Mass Effect 1 toed the line by offering some of the action elements that shooter fans enjoy with some of the role-playing tactics that the hardcore fans of the genre want. The sequel improves both areas for a through-and-through satisfying battle system. On PC, the heads-up display is a bit different, custom built to work with a keyboard and mouse. Both versions are largely identical, though you will get a few more options for customizing hot keys and skill usage on the PC. Which works better for you will be a matter of personal preference. An emphasis has clearly been put on ensuring that the combat in Mass Effect 2 never grows stale. Side quests each have their own unique areas to explore -- and you'll have to explore the galactic map, talk to random characters, and find key items to even trigger many of them. The combat zones themselves, however, have been cleaned up to be more straightforward and compelling, rather than repetitive labyrinths. New gameplay twists are introduced frequently with some large quests eschewing combat entirely. There's a great focus on exploration and discovery here and BioWare has made sure that the reward for doing so is worth the effort. I love the vangaurd. "

        "Content": "Kentucky Route Zero: Act 4 opens with a giant, robotic woolly mammoth perched on a boat, and gets stranger from there. The weirdness serves as a valuable storytelling tool, not a gimmick, and is tactfully employed to offset presuppositions we don\u2019t even know we have. Though the imagery is fanciful, it opens the door to this short but excellent adventure game episode\u2019s exploration of truly serious themes: the desperation of poverty, the nature of friendship, and the impending threat of death. A giant mammoth on a boat. In previous Acts, the subterranean journey down Route Zero has felt intrinsically rooted in the hill-and-cave country legacy of the Kentucky highlands: coal mines, distilleries, bad jobs, gospel music, poverty, apocalyptic spirituality, and mystical backwoods folklore wrapped in the twilight of magical realism. These elements are all still present, but Act 4 broadens the scope of the storytelling and embraces the rich, esteemed legacy of literature\u2019s river stories. The journey down the Echo and the striking, somber encounters along the way seem inspired by an Americana as old as Mark Twain. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery and a renewed understanding of their purpose. Though I appreciated the tranquil and maudlin tones of Act 4, it\u2019s the first episode in the series that didn\u2019t scare me. It\u2019s deeply consequential, but the de-emphasis on menace took a little away from the shadowy mystique that penetrates every aspect of the gloriously realized artistic vision. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery \u201c Playing Kentucky Route Zero is more like writing a novel than reading one. Character background stories are composed on the fly, chosen from a series of wildly divergent dialogue options that define the protagonists\u2019 histories. When someone asked the orphaned boy Ezra if he\u2019d ever been on a boat, I had the choice to define a deep, emotional memory of boats connected to his lost parents, relate a cursory tale about boats in cartoons, or decide that he\u2019d never even been on a boat before. When playing Route Zero, you\u2019re not just choosing where you\u2019re going, you\u2019re also deciding where you\u2019ve come from. This tremendous flexibility feels just as empowering as any climactic action scene or iconic puzzle. There are no bosses to beat or puzzles to solve, but there are very high stakes. The Mucky Mammoth Like previous episodes in Kentucky Route Zero, Act 4 regularly places you in control of multiple characters in the same conversations, constantly shifting your perspective and control in discussions. There\u2019s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene. The clean and simple interface kept this unusual dynamic from becoming confusing, and thanks to a clever script the constantly changing perspectives built up my empathy for the characters. There\u2019s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene \u201c The carefully crafted dialogue alternates between things people might actually say and a tone more reminiscent of things they\u2019re more likely to think. The effect fits the dreamworld state of the setting very well, but the thickness and constant existential awareness of the text might turn some players off. And then came wonderful, surprising moments where I suddenly lost control of a character and they stepped out (quite literally) on their own, autonomously making decisions that, whether coincidentally or by design, usually lined up with a behavior I would have chosen for them. These moments are few and far between, but when they happened they always made sense and added an air of comedic shock and genuine tragedy to the story. I happily discovered the sparks of independence made Conway and the other characters feel more like people and less like avatars and instruments of my will. Even when I disagreed with their choices, I respected them. Characters standing in the shadows. Act 4 is a short affair, easily completed in a couple of hours, but there\u2019s a surprising amount of variety in the storytelling method during that time. Route Zero is mostly a game about people talking, and Act 4 keeps finding ways to reframe that mechanic. One creative party encounter was experienced entirely as a series of security camera video tapes viewed by people I\u2019d never met, long after my party had passed by. Another was played out in a haunting, beautifully written river-raft tour through a subterranean wildlife preserve, and a third through the playful and thoughtful journeys of a wandering child capturing sounds on a handheld tape recorder. There\u2019s plenty of standard walk and talk, but Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale. Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale \u201c Every stop along the river has something thoughtful or delightful to offer, but not every encounter is an absolute home run. The concert sequence offered me a chance to get dynamically involved in creating music, but much like Act 3\u2019s interactive song sequence, the musical experiment here feels like it could have come together better with a little more tweaking. All these scenarios and portrayed in a lovely, minimalist graphical style that makes tremendous use of carefully chosen muted colors and shadowing to create a sense of surreality. The camera work is especially well implemented, with constant subtle zooming and panning that brings a sense of life and motion that\u2019s unusual in adventure games. The simulated flatness of the art is so well executed it lulls me into forgetting the characters are moving through a 3D space, and more than once this is startlingly exploited as the perspective twists or zooms to reveal the layered reality of the setting. A roaring prehistoric beast. Thematically, the transition comes at a perfect point in the broader Kentucky Route Zero story, as our heroes begin the chapter in a meandering, listless wandering, and through their encounters along the river, their way toward surrendering to who they are, or changing to become who they want to be. As one character observes: \u201cAll people need is enough to pretend they\u2019re home, and we can make it anywhere.\u201d"

As a parent, the prospect of engaging with a compelling, interactive story-telling experience was one I couldn\u2019t wait to try out; as a book lover I was intrigued to see if Wonderbook was capable of pushing the medium in a new and exciting direction. Unfortunately, the reality doesn\u2019t quite live up to expectations. Wonderbook \u2013 or more specifically Book of Spells, because I still believe the actual concept has potential \u2013 isn\u2019t quite interactive enough to make it an enjoyable game, and doesn\u2019t have the compelling narrative of a great book. Book of Spells is pitched as the must-read companion for every pupil at Hogwarts, a magical tome filled with every spell and incantation you could possibly wish to learn as a wannabe witch or wizard. It\u2019s split into five initial chapters, with freshers taking their first steps into the wizarding world by learning how to levitate and shooting water from the tip of their wand. By the time you reach the closing pages you\u2019ll have mastered summoning a Patronus to scare off Dementors. While the idea of following in Harry Potter\u2019s footsteps and conjuring a magnificent, shimmering beast to fight the worst Azkaban has to offer sounds interesting, perhaps Wonderbook\u2019s biggest misstep is that you don\u2019t actually get to use the spells that much once you\u2019ve learned then. Instead, the focus is very much on the gestures needed to cast them, using the Move to flick shapes and fire off spells. You open the book, learn a new spell, try it out and then rinse and repeat until you reach the final page. Of course, there\u2019s more to Book of Spells and one of its highlights is the way it brings each spell to life. When you discover a new spell you\u2019re treated to a tale explaining its origins, told either by the narrator or through a puppet show in a paper theatre that pops up from the pages of Wonderbook. It\u2019s a nice touch and helps bring the wizarding world to life, especially when it asks you to interact with the Wonderbook itself, turning it around to get an alternative view or picking it up to discover something that otherwise you couldn\u2019t see. The problem is, of the 20 spells there are to learn, only a handful actually make really good use of what Wonderbook is capable of. Mostly, the stories are presented in much the same way with little variation and while the paper theatre tales are charming they do grow tiresome by the time you reach the end of the book. If there more ways of unravelling the story, rather than just a couple of ways, the whole experience would\u2019ve been far more compelling. The same criticism can be aimed at the practice areas you\u2019re dropped in after learning the spells. The world of Harry Potter is rich and varied, yet in the game you\u2019re constantly forced to revisit the same Hogwarts hall or herbology room, zapping gnomes and imps, time and again. It\u2019s fun to begin it doesn\u2019t take long before it feels like your retreading old ground. Book of Spells does get some things right. The presentation is fantastic; the way the book springs to life and monsters crawl from its pages is exactly what Wonderbook excels at, and the idea of a proper storybook that incorporates these elements is something I\u2019m still holding out for. The narrative, too, is very good and the delivery of the dialogue is easily on par with what you\u2019d expect from an audio book, only here you\u2019re interacting with the story. And then there\u2019s the orchestral score, which is both fantastical and mischievous, and captures the Harry Potter vibe perfectly. However, those looking for a fully-fledged Potter experience will be disappointed. Yes, you\u2019ll learn many of the spells and interact with creatures ripped straight out of the world JK Rowling created. But, considering the source material it\u2019s based on, it doesn\u2019t go quite far enough. Additionally, while much of the narrative maintains the charm and character of the books and will most definitely appeal to Potter fans, because there\u2019s no overarching story pulling it together, it\u2019s more like a series of disjointed limericks than a true addition to the Potter canon."

        "Subtitle": "Inexorable",
        "Content": "The ending of Life is Strange: Episode 2 - Out of Time took the wind out of me. It\u2019s an episode wounded by character inconsistencies, frequently terrible dialogue, and tedious puzzles, but the finale brings the series\u2019 strongest story moments together in a heartbreaking way -- and you can't do anything to undo it. Main character Max Caulfield\u2019s choices from both Episodes 1 and 2 come to a head and really have substantial meaning to the people around her. In turn, suddenly Life is Strange has meaning to me. I criticized Life is Strange: Episode 1 - Chrysalis , for failing to create convincing, compelling characters, and developer Dontnod has almost entirely rectified this issue in Out of Time. The writing and character performances remain problematic, but the humanity hidden beneath the awkward delivery of out-of-place lines bursts free in Episode 2. For the first time, I\u2019m interested in character arcs and mysteries that aren\u2019t directly about Max Caulfield. Characters that didn\u2019t work before now have more meaningful time in the spotlight, and they have a huge effect on Max\u2019s future. All of this feeds back into a likable, relatable protagonist I continue to enjoy playing. The figure at the front of this is Kate Marsh, a devout Catholic with no memory of certain humiliating events that have gone viral. In Episode 2, which is ultimately her story, Kate\u2019s position as the school\u2019s least-liked student grows into something more dramatic. I was receptive to that. I did everything in my power to support Kate because Life is Strange creates brutal situations that made me want to. Hints of drugs, mental illness, and potential sexual abuse make for a nasty combo. Still, I would understand why a player may not pick up on these subtle, quiet elements of Kate\u2019s story, and prioritize other characters and choices instead. After all, Max has other problems (and closer friends) to worry about, too. Chloe, Max\u2019s old friend who became a rebellious troublemaker, brings us closer to the mystery of Rachel Amber, a fellow student who\u2019s been missing for a concerning amount of time. Exploring the junkyard where Rachel and Chloe spent time together showed a sad, almost jealous side of Max I didn\u2019t know existed. We also get a look at what Rachel meant to Chloe, who felt abandoned when she and Max lost touch in the years before the series started. Life is Strange succeeds most with meaningful moments like this. Episode 1 dabbled in creating an effective relationship, and tapping into the volatility of teenage emotion, but Episode 2 makes it count. These great scenes happen despite (and partially because of) weak puzzle-solving sections. Life is Strange: Episode 2 has a couple scenarios that rely on more conventional video game design than its story-centric sequences. By the end, though, I really appreciated what these limp scenarios led to. A tedious sequence meant to expose Chloe to Max\u2019s time-rewinding powers has unexpected meaning later on, as does the time-consuming fetch-quest that follows. It just isn\u2019t clear until you\u2019re blindsided by its significance. Everything in Out of Time just feels important in a way Chrysalis didn\u2019t. I would rewind time to undo choices, regret it, rewind again, regret it, and eventually settle on something I wasn\u2019t sure about. When circumstances prevented rewinding at one point, the series' heaviest scene so far carried that much more weight. By Episode 3, it\u2019ll be too late to change what I did in Episode 2, and I can\u2019t wait to see what mess I made for myself during its stressful finale. The emotional gravity of those moments also leads into a great cliffhanger, and I\u2019m genuinely upset I can\u2019t see the rest of the story through right now. If the rest of the series capitalizes on the strengths of Episode 2, and abandons the failures of the premiere, it could really be something special after all.

        "Content": "An immediate follow-up to episode 1, The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Episode 2: \"Ties That Bind Part II\u201d takes Part I\u2019s solid start and runs with it much faster than a walker ever could. The episode feels more tied to both the familiar trappings of Walking Dead and Telltale Games' plot structures. Yet by building on the foundation of the last episode and the two seasons before it, the conclusion of this two-part opener sets up an intriguing rest of the season \u2014 one that makes me feel like my choices actually matter (even if that\u2019s likely an illusion).  Picking up from Part I\u2019s dramatic final moments, \u201cTies That Bind\u2019s\u201d second half forces Javi to learn the true cost of surviving in this world for the first time since his introductory flashback in the season premiere. It\u2019s easy to see how many dialogue choices and actions only matter in the moment, but I continued to care deeply about how Javi reacted to every blow to his family and his world. I fought to keep Javi\u2019s hope and determination alive, even as the world around him actively worked to shake him of that resilience. And some of those choices paid off within the episode itself as it deepened our understanding of Javi\u2019s relationships. Picking up an item in the environment leads to a kind gesture later in the episode, and the long-term work Javi puts in with Kate and the kids over these two episodes feels important, even if it isn\u2019t drastically altering the plot just yet. Without spoiling anything, however, I was excited to begin to notice how choices I made during Javi\u2019s flashbacks are helping to define relationships in the present. Even if it's just in passing conversations, it's reassuring to see my influence actually carrying some narrative weight. \u201c The same can be said of Clementine, whose flashback in Part II feels much more important than in the premiere. The episode thankfully gives us some more details about the title of the season\u2019s meaning (other than its obvious metaphorical idea), and the New Frontier\u2019s role in things is surprisingly malleable. They have an impact on Clementine\u2019s backstory, but it seems that we have some welcome input on that very impact, which imbues some of the moments in the present-day story with some nice additional emotional heft. And reaching even further back into Clementine\u2019s history, choices made with her and even Lee in previous seasons will shift the tone of some side interactions with her. How they will continue to impact the season remains to be seen \u2014 I\u2019m not prepared to say just how much the overarching story will actually change this season because of those choices, because based on Telltale\u2019s history it\u2019s unlikely that a season\u2019s plot would branch in a significant way this early on \u2014 but this far into the series it's reassuring to see my influence actually carrying some narrative weight. Outside of those choices, however, Part II offers some sadly familiar events. After a tense standoff early in the episode, the remaining survivors head off to a supposed safe haven for medical attention, only to predictably find trouble along the way. Any Walking Dead fan will certainly find something repetitive in that idea, and the fun appearance of a familiar franchise character didn\u2019t make the overused plot ideas any less disappointing. But I was kept engaged by the continued strong character work, even if Part II lacks some of the cinematic flourishes that felt so special in Part I. And even when the episode's scenes fell into recognizable territory, the quicktime event action scenes were often executed with tense, well-paced scenarios.",

        "Content": "As statements of intent go, thrusting a man's damp, naked bottom centre-stage, in full lingering view, a mere 90 seconds into Heavy Rain pretty much says all you need to know. It's practically a finger to gaming's hyper-sexualised nymphos and instant gratification and it's clear Quantic Dreams has no bones about doing things differently.  With its methodical build-up, it's not a game that feels obliged to dazzle from the off and your first hour or so is a deliberately-paced procession of humdrum domesticity and mild dramatic jolts that slowly, insidiously draw you into the game's astonishingly bleak atmosphere. It might make for a slow start but, once you're invested in its universe, Heavy Rain's extraordinary moments and emotional pay-offs are all the more powerful.    Undoubtedly, Heavy Rain resonates thanks to its strikingly realistic presentation, compelling narrative and rounded, likeable cast of characters, but Quantic Dreams' wilfully idiosyncratic - and likely divisive - game mechanics play an equally crucial part in your investment in the game.  If you're at all familiar with Quantic Dreams' previous Fahrenheit, you'll instantly be at home here. The developer has taken its previous innovations and infused them with subtle refinements. Split roughly into two distinct play types, Heavy Rain features third-person exploration and interactive QTE-style cut-scenes.    Giving absolutely nothing of the story away, the game readily switches from character to character between chapters, each with their own specific motives for uncovering the titular Origami Killer. As these separate tales intersect, you spend much of your time methodically probing environments for clues to the killer's identity. You've direct control during these segments, shifting one of the game's four main protagonists around gloriously desolate locations, experimenting with a huge variety of incidental objects until something significant happens.  Object interaction employs the right analogue stick to perform movements designed to mimic actions you'd use in real life - as denoted by translucent arrows hovering over key items. It's a bit silly at first, seeming almost unnecessarily elaborate. Ultimately though - clunky SIXAXIS integration aside - it adds a subtle layer of immersion to the experience. Again, no spoilers, but as the game really starts to bare its teeth with some agonisingly brutal moral quandaries, it's amazing how effectively these simple directional choices take on truly sickening significance. It's just a shame that the peculiar movement mechanism makes characters look so stilted, particularly in a game that strives so hard for naturalism.   Interactive cut-scenes meanwhile adopt a similar set-up, using an intuitive combination of button presses to reflect your on-screen options and, while many might complain about the lack of interaction in these often superbly-choreographed moments, the fact you're able to almost subliminally influence the outcome of events is quite a feat. Thankfully too, Heavy Rain's new prompt system is nowhere near as intrusive as that seen in Fahrenheit, meaning you're actually able to sit back and enjoy the action unfold without jarring icons spoiling your view.  For all the illusion of freedom in the world though, each chapter has a very definite beginning and end, with Quantic Dreams' rubber-band approach to story-telling frequently proving disappointingly restrictive. Essentially - at least during the first half of the game - you're only able to influence proceedings in largely superfluous ways. For instance, a fight might end prematurely if you take too long to respond, or a conversation might take a slightly different route before drawing to the same conclusion. Sure, it's fun to experiment with different possibilities, but they're generally so superficial as to be ultimately meaningless - something that's likely to severely limit promised replay potential.    It's in the game's latter half where your decisions really start to matter and it's here that the game impresses with its sense of consequence. Whether the result of genuine deliberation or simple carelessness, your actions start to have significant ramifications for the story's outcome - certainly, don't expect all, or indeed any, of your characters to make it through to the finale.  While the myriad deviations available in the latter stages mean some scenes fall foul of gaping plot holes, it's still a remarkably fluid experience. Admittedly, the game's episodic denouement does tend to feel slightly cheap in its blatantly mechanical construction but there's such a wide range of outcomes - from resolutely bleak to grudgingly optimistic - that it's a small price to pay.    As an overall experience then, it's not always successful, with limited freedom and interaction the most frustrating issues to highlight. What stops Heavy Rain from feeling like a dreary slog though is the compelling construction of individual chapters. Overall, it's a fairly traditional murder-mystery yarn but individual sequences twist and turn with such recklessly inventive bravado - effortlessly shifting from downbeat stoicism to dazzling action - that it's thoroughly captivating."

Dustborn is tackling big ideas, and it's doing it with robots in bunny hats, broken-hearted biker queens, and science-fiction squid things. This mash-up of comic books, Telltale-inspired narrative adventures, and rhythm games is like a buffet of styles, story, and action, and it works better than it has any right to. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You play as Pax, an aloof conwoman transporting secret cargo to Canada with a gang of fellow superpowered smugglers posing as a punk band. It's set in an intriguing alternate version of America where JFK was never assassinated, Marilyn Monroe is referred to as Lady Justice, and a blast of concentrated information has gifted some people with powers. Not laser eyes or flying \u2013 think more gaslighting, controlling minds with your voice, illusion magic, and more. Dustborn is primarily about making choices through dialogue and actions that drive your character toward a specific end to that road trip. Will you snuggle up with your ex? Will you tell the rest of the crew about your plan? Will you eavesdrop on their calls? (I mean that last one, obviously.) When you're not talking to your allies through cute conversations that sound like they should come with a mental health TikTok hashtag, there is some action too. Your punk songs at gigs will play out as timed rhythm games, you\u2019ll capture floating entities called Echos by dragging them into place with a modded handheld, and you'll even fight various people and robots by swinging around a boomerang baseball bat and using your commanding powers to push, freeze, or confuse enemies. I can never resist a bit of button-mashing music action, and while the combat is simplistic, it looks dope. I'd have liked more of these sections to balance out all the talking, but there's a good chance I'm just impatient and emotionally stunted. Which guitar game do you want to make a triumphant return? Rock Band Guitar Hero Gitaroo Man GuitarFreaks Er... BandFuse: Rock Legends? Answer See Results Either way, the pacing is Dustborn's biggest flaw. This campaign has a slow start with enough exposition to choke a donkey, leading with a seemingly endless amount of angsty conversations before you get a chance to do anything fun with these characters. It's particularly easy to get irritated when everything you're doing seems to involve people getting kind of mad at you. Eventually you learn more about each band member and how to navigate your conversations, and there's an emotional payoff to all the chit-chat, but at first Pax and the people she's dealing with just seem a bit lame. Turns out nothing brings people together like hitting robots with a baseball bat in combat combos or rocking out as a band, and it won me over too. To make Dustborn worthwhile, you need to embrace the whole package. \u201c Those action sequences aren\u2019t the deepest on their own, either, so to make Dustborn a worthwhile investment you're going to need to embrace the whole package. If you're in it for just one mechanic, say the music, you'll likely lose patience waiting for your next chance to jam out. Similarly, there's no way to speed run all the emotional stuff \u2013 even if you don't care about being a stone-cold bitch to your buddies and decide to cut them off whenever possible, you're still going to need to analyze those decisions to move a chapter forward. I stuck with it because every time I was ready to bow out some part of a narrative thread gently pulled me back in, and I'm a sucker for robots and relationship drama. Whether it's in the story setup, the variety of its characters, or the way its conflicts are approached in conversations, Dustborn has clearly made a conscious effort to be as inclusive as possible. It\u2019s to a degree that felt performative at first, and I say that as someone who is neither straight nor entirely mentally healthy, but that philosophy eventually becomes the driving force behind what makes both these characters and your decisions concerning them far more complicated and interesting. That positive message doesn't get in the way of gameplay, because the gameplay is all about being different and finding a place in society. X-Men did it in the 80s, and now Dustborn is doing it using the issues and visual language of 2024. When that story hits its stride and shows the confidence to have more levity in its sometimes over-serious dialogue or give you bigger chunks of autonomy, I was all in. Investigating a sinister, robot-filled research lab with my bratty little sister; getting a perfect streak during a small-town performance of a punk track; taking a robot hat shopping in an abandoned mall; using increasingly weird combos of powers in combat; it all combined with the dialogue to give emotional consequence to my choices, good or bad. I won't be going back for a replay, but I will always think fondly of that time I went on a road trip with a bunch of weirdos and set fire to a gas station."

        "Content": "The Ar Tonelico series is well known for its rampant innuendos, scantily clad heroines, and overarching love stories that span epic narratives. The third title in the series, Ar Tonelico Qoga: The Knell of Ar Ciel, is the first title to arrive on the PlayStation 3. Full of quirky oddities that can mainly be chalked up to a difference in culture, this game continues the trends of its predecessors but changes enough elements of the formula to set itself apart, for better and for worse. The biggest problem the game faces is that the jump into this generation of console actually hinders certain game mechanics to the point of frustration. Additionally, the handling of intricate relationships often takes a lowbrow route that misses the mark.   Conversations take center stage throughout the game.  You control Aoto, a simple construction apprentice who finds himself swept into a plot that takes him places far removed from his humble beginnings. He falls in the path of two mysterious Reyvatiels (the game world's version of spell-casters), Saki and Finnel, and must protect them as the team strives to discover why they're being pursued by the armies of Clustania. The overall story is a compelling one. There are memorable characters throughout and the twists, changes, and shifting loyalties remain intriguing from start to finish. It follows a long arc where you'll encounter branching paths and multiple endings depending on how you choose to play out your relationships at certain key moments.  The developers created a schism in the graphical department. The main characters are well designed and animate beautifully, but the crisp animations end up creating a stark contrast between the character models and the hand-painted backgrounds. The separation makes the characters feel as though they're floating around the world and not actually a part of it. Characters will run faster than their legs are moving on screen, they'll bounce up and down stairs, they'll jump awkwardly into the air at different times, and none of it feels as though there's a smooth balance between their feet and the world around them.    Combat has been completely revamped in this new take on the Ar Tonelico world. Rather than a turn-based series of button-combos, Ar Tonelico Qoga has switched over to a real-time combat system where your party is thrown onto a flat battlefield to fight soldiers, robots and any number of odd beasts populating the world. Your Reyvatiel holds her position on the battlefield and by fighting to the beat of her singing you'll build up powerful Purge spells and Burst attacks to unleash on your enemies. While it's a bold departure from its predecessors, the new combat system is bland, repetitive and wholly unsatisfying.  The problem with switching to a real-time system is that the combat ends up feeling like button-mashing. While you need to attack to the beat, you're only using a single button to attack with your Vanguard and mashing out three-hit combos. As you go, you'll synthesize new special moves, but they're all based on adding a directional arrow to your original attack button. After completing my first hundred battles (nowhere near the end), I already found the combat system to be overly simplistic, which is not a common trait to JRPGs. Attack, protect your Reyvatiel, Purge, repeat.  The battlegrounds are loose interpretations of whatever environment you happen to be exploring at the time, but they're always a flat, round, and boring plane that doesn't add to the overall excitement. The lack of obstacles and variety feel like a wasted opportunity. Especially the more powerful variations of the Purges show off just how empty the battleground is. Beyond the bland battlegrounds, the overall world feels empty, too. You'll wander long and empty sections of futuristic dungeons where every wrong turn will throw a chest full of goodies at your feet. The town segments are the best looking, with a variation of several locations spattered across the map.    The game features three key elements that all combine to augment how powerful your characters are in various ways. First up is the aforementioned combat. Second is the ability to have intimate conversations with your Reyvatiels at any point where you can rest for the night. The third element is diving into the mind of your Reyvatiels in order to help them with emotional hang-ups, personal insecurities, and growing their person from within. The problem with these components is that combat is by far the most developed, and the conversations and diving are limited to simple two-dimensional conversations and a board-game like map. I understand the conversation elements and do like what the developers tried to accomplish by allowing you to create a stronger bond between the characters. What I don't like about the system is that while talking and diving deal with high-level emotional issues, the majority of the dialogue falls upon sophomoric giggling and embarrassment over simple kissing. Granted, this is a common trait in the world of anime, but the game truly reaches touching heights by its late stage relationship breakthroughs.  While the game offers multiple difficulty levels, none of them truly present a challenge. Characters gain levels every few battles and without grinding you'll easily hit around level 50 by the time you hit hour 20. Additionally, the diving and crafting elements don't force you to go beyond a certain point, so their inclusion becomes a task for completionists rather than a requirement for growth. You'll constantly gather equipment and items from treasure chests, so you'll never be lacking for items or money.    The game retains the same tone and level of innuendo as its predecessors. The humor, the awkwardness, and the downright horror of certain scenes remain forefront in the game. The sexual conversations, the way \"diving\" is described, having to remove crystals from inside characters -- all of these things will either make you smile with their sexual-quirkiness or shirk in horror from what you're seeing. But for fans of the series, you'll feel right at home with the tongue-in-cheek references found in almost every conversation of the game.  The voice acting works pretty well, though the high-pitched naivety and innocence of the female stars in the English track certainly doesn't change as they grow from an emotional standpoint. And if you switch to the original Japanese soundtrack, often the recorded dialogue is blown out to the point of it sounding like a scratchy mistake. These sound foibles are accompanied by a great soundtrack, but one where key tracks are repeated too often during story-scenes. One of my favorite aspects of moving through an epic RPG is when the music takes a similar emotional journey to the high points of the drama. But even late in the game you'll still hear simple tracks that popped up just a few hours into the game against much lesser evils. That being said, the larger confrontations do present more interesting songs as the beat to which you'll need to attack becomes more important and prominent to the battle."

        "Content": "It\u2019s a little nitpicky, but One Piece: Romance Dawn is a bit of a misnomer. The story arc called Romance Dawn is told in the first four episodes of the anime, but Romance Dawn the game encompasses nearly 500 episodes of One Piece canon, from the beginning all the way to the Marineford arc. It\u2019s a long journey for the Straw Hat Pirates (and for watchers of the anime), but it\u2019s all done after just 20 hours of disappointing, skeletal roleplaying gameplay. It\u2019s a weak game that mangles its beloved source material, making me wonder: Who is this even for? The storytelling (or retelling) in Romance Dawn is done through manga-style speech bubbles and minimally animated character portraits, with only a few oddly selected cutscenes shown in high quality. Character background, justification for battles, and even main story events are told this way, which leaves little time for One Piece-style goofiness and makes the dialogue a little dense. After about an hour of playing, I was really tired the dialogue scenes \u2014 they can be several minutes long, and knowing that a better-animated version of the same story exists made it seem pointless. Outside of the story, Romance Dawn feels like the bare minimum that an RPG should be. It has a rather static format structured around important plot points (of the typical cutscene-dungeon-boss-cutscene variety). The biggest missed opportunity is the bland level design, which is linear and completely unengaging. The dungeon-like areas (mostly islands, in this case) are built like corridors, and all you have to do is walk until you see treasure, get the treasure, and then move on \u2014 there\u2019s no real exploration to speak of. I felt like a lab rat searching for the boss in every level, which became dull after I completed the first one. Fittingly, there\u2019s an area called the Maze Isles. There are also some strange quick-time event sections, which felt like a forced attempt to add more gameplay.  The most frustrating thing about these levels \u2013 especially the bonus ones unrelated to the story \u2014 is that they contribute nothing to the plot or characters and feel like filler between cutscenes. The extra ones especially irritated me, as the items I got hardly felt worth my time and effort. Level after level, I failed to see the point. The only real incentive to play Romance Dawn, as opposed to watching the anime, is the turn-based combat. It\u2019s pretty typical RPG fare \u2013 you control up to three of the Straw Hats on a 3D field, with the added element of chaining attack commands together for critical hits. It takes some practice to get the timing right, which made it more engaging that it otherwise would have been. A two-on-two fight against Fishman bosses Hatchan and Kuroobi, for instance, proved challenging and required just the right amount of skill to get the necessary critical hits.  Combat also involves positional tactics, though their efficacy is questionable. You can move freely in the battle area until you begin an attack, but if you move beyond a certain point, you\u2019ll be penalized. This helped me pace battle \u2013 rather than brute force my way through an easier boss, I had to take turns to move correctly and set up the right attacks between my party members. It adds a needed dimension to the gameplay, but it\u2019s not really necessary against some of the regulation baddies you encounter on your way to a boss. Against them, battle became an exercise in mashing buttons to pull off a combo. It\u2019s not a terrible combat system, but it\u2019s not outstanding either \u2014 and outstanding combat was what Romance Dawn needed to be worth it.",

        "Content": "Update: Undertale is now available for Nintendo Switch. The game is identical visually and content-wise, except for some minor tweaks over the 2017 PlayStation 4 release (and the original 2015 Windows/OSX version). Most notably, the Switch version adds a new miniboss encounter not found in the previous versions. Our original review from August 15, 2017 follows.  Note: the review contains some small spoilers for Undertale.  I finished my first playthrough of Undertale in stunned silence. My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That\u2019s kind of Undertale\u2019s specialty \u2014 playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.  As a lone human fallen into an underground world that serves as a prison for monsters, I had my journey laid out for me, as most RPG protagonists do. For my first playthrough I took a pacifist approach, being as kind and merciful as possible as I searched for a way back to the surface. But I made a mistake: I accidentally killed a monster in the beginning. So I restarted without saving, as I would in any other game when I needed a do-over. Except\u2026 things were different this time. Dialogue had changed to reflect that I\u2019d seen her die. Then Flowey, Undertale\u2019s chaotic evil, fourth wall-breaking flower, tore into me for having the gall to abuse the power of the save state.  Gaming the System  Undertale expected me to have played RPGs before and played with those conventions in unexpected ways. That first berating from Flowey shaped the rest of my experience \u2014 I learned I couldn\u2019t bank on a soft reset, so I had to tread carefully. Everything I did mattered. That clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn\u2019t have been told in any other way or medium. Undertale has to be a game, and that\u2019s the key to its brilliance.  Its dodging-based combat minigames especially rely on that concept. Boss battles consistently subverted my expectations, even after I thought I\u2019d figured everything out, but even run-of-the-mill random encounters are closely intertwined with storytelling and worldbuilding. Every enemy has a unique personality expressed both through combat and non-combative options. In my pacifist run I ended up talking to a lot of monsters, giving out hugs, and even (and especially) flirting with them to avoid killing them. In order to spare a monster that wanted to flirt but didn\u2019t want to admit it, I had to \u201cget close but not too close.\u201d That option changed the rules of combat so that I had to narrowly dodge incoming projectiles\u2026 until the monster blushed so much that it stopped fighting. Undertale has to be a game, and that\u2019s the key to its brilliance. \u201c  There are tons of jokes that appeal to internet nerds, and I often felt like Undertale was talking directly to me, like it knew what I was thinking. An anime-loving character\u2019s \u201cselfie,\u201d for example, is actually a picture of a garbage can with pink sparkle filters over it (and speaking from experience, this is very accurate). I especially love Undertale\u2019s humor when it has something to say, however subtle. I entered a snail race (called Thundersnail) and was told to press Z repeatedly to encourage my snail to win. I spammed Z until she burst into flames, and the Thundersnail organizer told me that \u201call that pressure to succeed really got to her.\u201d It was, like many of Undertale\u2019s one-off jokes, extremely relatable \u2014 and knowing and predicting its audience is one of Undertale\u2019s biggest strengths.  Monsters Are People Too  Undertale\u2019s writing is consistently funny, but it can also be touching. Small, semi-hidden notes and dialogue enrich the world and build on an already compelling story of humanity and morality. A favorite was a series of \u201cecho flowers\u201d in a beautiful, ethereal hallway that repeated snippets of an overhead conversation. A monster didn\u2019t want to share her greatest wish \u2014 that one day she would climb the mountain that traps all the monsters underground and look out at the world \u2014 for fear of being laughed at, and although her friend promised they wouldn\u2019t, the friend ended up laughing anyway. It was silly, until the last flower repeated: \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just funny\u2026 That\u2019s my wish too.\u201d  Experiencing the depth of the monsters\u2019 hopes and dreams is crucial to Undertale\u2019s exploration of morality, personhood, and conflict. Different monsters talk about each other in front of you, so once I met them I got to discover who they actually were, as opposed to what their reputations suggested. Most of the main characters are also very well developed with consistent personalities across different dialogue and story routes. It made it hard for me to summon the aggression to attack any of them \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely the point. When I was trying to go for a more violent run, fighting monsters I\u2019d once flirted with made Undertale\u2019s message about humanity hit even harder.  Determination  Some fights can be frustrating or even tedious, however, at least at first. In a violent playthrough, I had to grind quite a bit to meet certain story requirements and grew tired of it after a while. Fighting enemy after enemy replaced the puzzles in the peaceful runs, however, and the tradeoff felt very balanced and ultimately meaningful to the story. I also found myself trudging back through areas I had already cleared just so I could beat a boss or get an item, and while it was absolutely worth it in the end, I wasn't terribly excited to do it. At one point I had run out of gold and needed to buy healing items, and the only shop that would buy items off of me was about a 10 minute walk away. (The other shopkeepers don't buy items because they don't want your trash.)  That said, I don't regret any of the extra time I spent walking around, because I got to find things like Thundersnail and the echo flowers. It's the little details that make Undertale so special, and I wanted to see them all. Every one of them feels deliberate \u2014 long sections of dialogue at the beginning and certain fights can be slow, but they are necessary for establishing the characters in a way that only games can do. In a different run, underwhelming boss battles turn mournful because of what one-hit KOs imply in the world. It was Undertale's ongoing, well-woven theme of determination that kept me playing and replaying. Even though the art isn't always pretty \u2014 it's often ugly, even \u2014 Undertale is an incredibly expressive game from start to finish, making up for visual limitations with excellent music and charming animations. It's also gender- and sexuality-inclusive in a very real, noticeable way. Every small detail reveals an intimate understanding of its audience, and that is essential to what makes Undertale\u2019s commentary on personhood so effective. Playstation 4 Review, August 15 2017 By Brendan Graeber After playing through Undertale on PS4, I\u2019m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more). The only real additions I spotted are on the periphery, like being able to set a background to the centered 4:3 ratio screen, and the dynamically changing art is a nice touch. You can also choose to navigate both the world and in combat using either analogue stick or D-pad. Both work well, but the sensitivity of the stick in certain fights had me preferring the buttons to the stick."

        "Subtitle": "A not so glorious role-playing game.",
        "Content": "They say you can take a girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl. The same can be said about classic, turn-based role-playing games. Glory of Heracles teleports the player to ancient Greece for an adventure where the gods of Olympus are real and dangerous monsters lurk around every corner. It's a rather interesting setting for an RPG and one that hasn't been beaten to death the way high-fantasy or sci-fi has. In the end, however, Glory of Heracles feels like just another cookie cutter game, sorely lacking inspiration.  While all of the role-playing mechanics are completely functional, it is the pacing and storytelling that ultimately doom Glory of Heracles. You play as Heracles himself...or at least you're initially led to believe that's who you are. In classic clich\u00e9 fashion, your character and most of the party members have no recollection of their past. This sets up the \"tension\" of the story. Are you Heracles or is this other guy? That yawn inspiring plot-line serves as both the introduction and the sole motivation for hours upon hours of the game.  It'll take you quite a while to actually get started on the trek to Mount Olympus to determine your ultimate destiny. Along the way, the party is side-tracked repeatedly and subjected to some seriously bad writing. My personal favorite was the line, \"Don't be a heel, Achilles.\" Get it? You'll get a whole lot of that in Glory of Heracles, along with a whole lot of talk about fate, as you trek from bland dungeon to bland town and then on to the next bland dungeon in a far to linear and monotonous quest.  Glory of Heracles moves along in a rather stress free manner. None of the random encounters are very difficult and there is a suitable \"auto\" attack that does all of the work for you. The game warns you when the party is confronted by a particularly difficult battle, letting you know that it's time to wake up and pay attention or to run away. It will even prompt you to save before entering a new and challenging area. The only real stressor in the game is the fact that random battles occur far too often, forcing the player into fights as often as every few steps.     This lackadaisical approach to combat and gameplay quickly lulls you into a hazy experience where everything blends together and nothing is particularly memorable. To be sure, there is a whole slew of traditional RPG game mechanics tossed into Glory of Heracles, but it's hard to care about any of them. None stand out as original or impressive, and none feel all too important in the grand scheme of things.  Everything from crafting weapons to polishing rusty equipment to adding upgrades to weapons and armor is present here. Some of these traditional game elements have nifty hooks to them, such as praying at temples and statues devoted to the Grecian gods to learn new skills and spells. You can even upgrade the casting power of spells, performed during combat with little touch screen mini-games. Of course, when the game quickly breaks down to repeatedly hitting the auto-battle button to plow through random encounter after random encounter, none of this really matters.  Without a compelling story, interesting characters, or exciting combat to drive things along, there isn't much reason to keep going. Those looking for a functional RPG to pass the time will find exactly that here, but little more.",

        "Content": "Returning to Arcadia Bay, Oregon in Life is Strange: Before the Storm brings back the coming of age, indie-film vibes and tugs of emotion defined the first Life is Strange Series. Of course, the first episode of this prequel, titled Awake, also comes with the awkward dialogue and unrealistic characterisation which made the original difficult to connect with at times. Playing through this dialogue-based adventure as local teenage rebel and angst queen Chloe Price can grant an appreciation for an often-prickly character. Unlike its predecessor, Life is Strange: Before the Storm (so far) doesn\u2019t appear to revolve around any supernatural powers, and instead features a more grounded back-talk ability that lets Chloe interject into other people\u2019s dialogue. That means that being a smart mouth teenager is literally the main mechanic for solving problems, and it works pretty well except that the over-the-top reactions from both Chloe and the other residents of Arcadia Bay can feel jarring and even unbelievable. A bouncer letting an underage smart-mouth girl into a club because she insults his bike or a parent\u2019s inability to accept thanks, all feel like exaggerated fantasies rather than genuine moments. This is balanced out by Chloe\u2019s interactions with friends, which usually take a more relatable and believable tone. Awake bounces between acting as a tutorial for this new ability and showing the softer side of Chloe in what feels like a slightly awkward but promising start to this story.  Chloe still suffers from the bursts of unlikeable behaviour which also plagued her throughout the original Life is Strange, but this time the insight gained from playing the story through her eyes seats these in a more understandable realm. She\u2019s an angsty teen who\u2019s lost her father and her only friend and feels abandoned. Finding triggers for her scattered memories and reading through old texts was gut wrenching, especially after playing as Max in Life is Strange and being able to see how alone we left Chloe in her time of need. The talk-back ability is a new way to appreciate Chloe\u2019s personality \u201c She darts between being relatable, which throws me back to my own high school experience, and having interactions which don\u2019t always make sense. Real interactions while playing a game of DnD with friends felt funny, warm, and endearing, whereas when the skinny teen tried to intimidate two guys out of a bar fight rather than apologise I got the impression even Chloe herself didn\u2019t understand her logic. I soon settled into a pattern where the most favourable and satisfying results came from leaning into imagining what this flawed, insecure character might do rather than what seemed traditionally right or pious. Her back-talk ability relies heavily on this, and it\u2019s a new way to appreciate Chloe\u2019s personality. Listening closely to what the other people have said is key to making back-talk work, and Chloe will pick up on words and themes to give you a few potential responses. The timer on these choices does a good job of mimicking the feel of a real-life argument where you scramble to work out what the best comeback will be. Relative to the original Life is Strange, the lack of Max\u2019s magical rewind ability adds a level of permanency to these actions, which is nice other than that it took away some willingness to take big chances and see what might\u2019ve been. That said, none of the three times Awake uses this mechanic felt like they\u2019d have any major impact on the story and felt a bit hollow as a result, so hopefully, it\u2019s more of a warmup for more weighty decisions in future episodes.  Chloe defeats a bully with the power of bratty argumentativeness. \u201c Despite not seeing much consequence from decisions, many of Chloe\u2019s interactions can feel good. Defeating a bully using just the power of bratty argumentativeness gives a believable sense of teenaged accomplishment, even if it uses cheesy lines to do so. Being kind when it\u2019s the right thing to do or just finding the perfect smart answer all offer an inherent emotional sense of reward and achievement. Other characters also seem to respect and praise Chloe when she\u2019s successful in these bouts, and although it\u2019s a bit overt and almost fanciful, the results are not without satisfaction. Even with Chloe\u2019s angst and impetuous teenage behaviours, the most frustration I found came from other characters\u2019 responses to her. Her mother, Joyce, appears to try to see things from her position and responds to softness if Chloe offers with some of her own. But then Joyce also thoughtlessly antagonises Chloe by persistently pushing her towards her new boyfriend, David, about whom Chloe is not shy about expressing her dislike. And when you\u2019re forced into an interaction with David, whenever you attempt to extend an olive branch he\u2019ll ungratefully say the worst possible thing, to the point where it was comically unbelievable. The writing in these interactions felt more like a retelling in which a teenager tries purposefully to brand the participants as villains, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s intentional. Where the hook lies in all of this is in Chloe\u2019s relationships, less so with her parents and more with her classmates \u2013 especially the whirlwind one that develops between her and the very popular Rachel Amber. In this episode, we witness the beginnings of the affection Chloe harbors for the infamous Rachel in the original Life is Strange. It feels rushed, but in the way that only teenage love can, and sparks some genuine emotion in all the awkwardness. Rachel is in some ways even angrier at the world and less grounded than Chloe, and watching Chloe\u2019s desperation at trying to hold on to their relationship made me understand and side with her in ways I was initially worried I never would.  Anyone who\u2019s played the original Life is Strange has a fair idea about what\u2019s coming for these characters, but so far the journey looks to be interesting even if the destination is clear. I feel that if Life is Strange: Before the Storm ever manages to find its feet it will have a compelling tale to deliver, and I hope that despite what I\u2019ve seen so far my actions will have a significant say in what that actually is. Based on these first few hours I\u2019m confident that this story has the ability to tear my heart out, but am little worried that shaky dialogue and unbelievable interactions will get in the way.  "
