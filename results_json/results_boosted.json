        "Content": "Rather than wasting my time with some colorful journalistic jargon, I'm simply going to keep this short and sweet: Dragon Ball GT Final Bout is utter crap. Having said that, I'm sure you want to know why. So let me explain. The gameplay, or rather the lack of it, is the primary issue. This is mainly due to the diabolical controls. A good fighting game has fluid, accurate and responsive controls. DBZ's are choppy, inaccurate and totally unresponsive. You press a button to punch, and there's a huge delay before the character executes it. This is very frustrating, especially when combined with the spastic character animation, which jerks more than a horny gamer on a Friday night. Adding even more misery is the choppy camera movement. It's like being stuck in a spin dryer. One minute the camera is pointing up in the sky, the next it's zooming in on another character. The thing that makes it all horrible is the fact that the camera doesn't pan smoothly, it just switches from view to view, so you often get completely lost. Sometimes you don't even see the other character who you're supposed to be fighting. The final kick in the nuts is the fact that there are very few fighting moves. The basic moves are dull to say the least (kicks, punches, feeble ranged moves and seemingly random flurries), and combos are nearly impossible to pull off. The end result is the most limited and frustrating fighting action yet seen on the PlayStation. On the positive side, the graphics aren't too bad. The polygonal characters are very true to their anime counterparts, and the cool sound helps add audio-visual appeal. There's even a cool anime FMV on the front end. But as we all know, graphics and sound don't make a game, it's the gameplay that counts, and that's something that this game simply lacks. If you're a Dragon Ball Z fan, then you may like this game, simply because it stars all your favorite Dragon Ball characters. But to be honest, you might as well go out and buy all the toys -- at least they're more controllable. Jay Boor",

        "Content": "Occasionally, while playing Celeste, I\u2019d get light-headed because I\u2019d focus so hard on a sequence of jumps that demanded precise timing and perfect button presses that I\u2019d forget oxygen was a thing my body needed. Trying and failing and trying again, getting a little closer each time, I let the beautiful art and adaptive music of the titular Celeste Mountain - alongside the passionate, relatable story told there - completely whisk me away.  Despite appearing at first to be yet another retro pixel-art 2D platformer, Celeste is surprising in so many different ways. From the moment I took my first jump, I fell in love with the satisfying way its protagonist, Madeline, feels to control; soon after I fell just as hard for the charming world she inhabits. But Celeste also caught me off guard with a relevant and emotional story about the pressures of modern life. What\u2019s remarkable is that the story isn\u2019t told in the background or overlaid on top of the action with constant interruption, but seamlessly and thoughtfully blended into the level design using both subtle themes and overt conversations. That\u2019s especially astonishing in a genre not known as a vehicle for such delicate messages.   That\u2019s the bigger picture, but every corner of Celeste is overflowing with charm. Its handful of characters are delightful and expressive, and the world they live in is teeming with small details. Smartly written dialogue is accompanied by silly, synthesized gibberish voices and animated character portraits that strikingly clash with the otherwise-pixelated art style, giving each character a distinct personality of their own. Little touches - like Madeline\u2019s red hair turning blue when she\u2019s spent her dash charge and then back again when it\u2019s restored by touching the ground or touching a power-up, or that dash causing lanterns in the background to sway when she zips by them - make everything feel alive and dynamic.  But Celeste doesn\u2019t succeed on charm alone \u2013 it also nails the fundamentals of its genre. All of that character is wrapped around one of the most blissfully fluid, responsive, and fun platformers I\u2019ve played since Super Meat Boy. For more than 20 hours of gameplay, Celeste has surprised me with consistently creative and fun platforming challenges and secrets that found unexpected depth from its relatively simple mechanics.  Mountain Dashing  Celeste\u2019s controls are extremely simple, just three buttons and a joystick, D-pad, or arrow keys. You can jump, dash once through the air in one of eight directions, and cling to walls and climb up or down for a limited time, but the nuance in how you use these easy-to-learn moves is extremely deep. Subtle changes in how long you hold each button, the angle of your jump, or the timing of your next dash can vastly change where you end up. This can be as simple as holding jump to keep yourself in the air longer or as complex dashing just next to a wall then quickly jumping off of it with precise timing to get you significantly more height. Critically, these factors were firmly in my own control and felt like skills that could be mastered.  Each success and failure was always my own \u2013 which is good because the failures do come often, and if even a fraction of them felt unfair it would\u2019ve been massively frustrating. Hazards such as spikes and traps scattered around each level will kill you with a single touch, and Celeste sadistically tracks every single death on a level-by-level basis - though it dismisses any worries you might have about how quickly that number rises, and actually encourages you to do your best along the way. Respawning is just as quick dying, with barely enough time for a Mega Man-like sparkle to signify your death, and the checkpoints are smartly placed to be forgiving while still making you prove you can complete the challenge in front of you.  Celeste has one of the best game soundtracks I\u2019ve heard in years. \u201c  Each of the eight chapters \u2013 a linear series of rooms that range in size from a single screen to a large side-scrolling area \u2013 have their own style, music, and a few unique platforming mechanics to interact with. The first takes place in a ruined city near the foot of the mountain and has platforms that speed along a track when you touch them (allowing you to launch yourself with a properly timed jump), while a later chapter is set closer to the peak, where winds will push you around and affect your speed and momentum. Every chapter feels distinct and different, which keeps Celeste from ever feeling stale.  The music and sound effects, in particular, deserve special mention here for the amazing amount of life they add to each location. Simply put, Celeste has one of the best game soundtracks I\u2019ve heard in years. It shifts with each screen, different instruments and variations fading in and out as the pace and intensity of the scene changes. The music pushed me along and slowed me down in harmony with the level design itself, and its connection to both the platforming and the story helped me connect more deeply with both Madeline and Celeste Mountain.  B-Side Myself  Unlike many other 2D platformers, there is a refreshing element of exploration to the layout of each chapter in Celeste. You can rush straight from start to finish if you\u2019d like, but destructible blocks and false walls often hide secret screens and diverging paths - and it\u2019s not uncommon to find secret areas hidden inside of other secret areas. It\u2019s not always easy to distinguish what\u2019s a secret path and what\u2019s just a dead end, which was initially a little frustrating, but there was usually some tell I could eventually learn to recognize - and the particularly well-disguised ones made going back to completed chapters to hunt for anything I\u2019d missed more exciting.   The most obvious reason to go looking for secret doors is the floating strawberries scattered throughout Celeste. Collecting them is completely optional, and many are hidden in dead-end screens that you could completely skipped, but trying to grab them provides some of the best platforming challenges available. Oftentimes, jumping from one side of a screen to the other can be relatively straightforward, but doing so while grabbing that screen\u2019s strawberry along the way takes much more finesse. Celeste also throws a bone to the completionists among us here, because after you\u2019ve beaten a chapter once you can pause to see a dotted line representing which strawberries you\u2019ve found and which you\u2019ve missed laid out in their rough order within that level, and you\u2019re able to restart at set checkpoints further into the chapter to access them without too much hassle.  The B-Sides are where the real challenge lies. \u201c But strawberries aren\u2019t the only collectible to grab. Every chapter also has a hidden B-Side cassette tape (developer Matt Makes Games playfully dates itself here) that, when found, unlocks a significantly harder, alternate version of that chapter with wonderfully remixed music. While the original chapters are generally difficult but doable enough that they come off as an excellently balanced base experience, the B-Sides are where the real challenge lies. It takes whatever mechanic that chapter introduced and pushes it to its limit, asking you for more creative problem solving with each screen, and then more precise button presses once you\u2019ve figured it out.  Beyond the B-Sides, there are even more secrets to find in Celeste. The hardest of these tested every part of the skills it had taught me: they required a careful eye to find clues about the path leading to them, were challenging to reach once I found them, and some even presented creative riddles that took me days of thinking on to finally crack. On top of the six to eight hours it took to beat the normal levels, I spent nearly another 20 finding collectibles and completing its brutally fun B-Sides - one of which took almost three hours and 1,400 deaths to complete, but had me literally jumping out of my chair with joy at multiple points. So it\u2019s remarkable that even after roughly 24 hours of playtime, Celeste still has so much more to offer.  Celeste Screenshots 13 Images  And through all this variation and excitement, the basics of movement don\u2019t ever really change. Similar to the brilliant Super Mario Odyssey\u2019s focus on Cappy, every part of Celeste\u2019s design revolves around Madeline\u2019s dash. It\u2019s the anchor for everything else, and each chapter plays with it in exciting and surprising ways. My favorite of these were the special diamonds (and some other level-specific mechanics) that can refresh your dash mid-air, creating ultra-satisfying sequences where you barely ever touch the ground.  Some of Celeste\u2019s harder levels make its inputs feel like a fighting game, even without any combat. \u201c  Sometimes your dash will move pieces of the world around you, making me think harder about the exact spot and angle I needed to use it. Celeste also plays around with momentum, letting you do things like use those moving platforms to launch yourself to otherwise unreachable spots. Without spoiling anything, some of the later levels also play around both with empowering your dash ability and severely limiting it, which continues to provide unique and amusing challenges without ever straying from that elegantly simple three-button core.  A few chapters put your knowledge of their unique mechanics to the test with \u201cboss fight\u201d style final sequences that turn up the pressure and force you to think and act quicker. There isn\u2019t really any combat in Celeste, but these sequences still manage to be intense and frantic, and a great way to put a different kind of spin on its level design. They also tie Celeste\u2019s story more directly into its platforming, with the emotion behind these sequences ratcheting up the pressure just as much as the mechanics themselves.  Some of Celeste\u2019s harder levels occasionally make it feel like a fighting game as well, asking you to move the stick in precise directions with tight timing. Dash up-right into a special orb that refreshes the dash, then swing the stick down-right before it spits you out in that direction, followed by quickly dashing right into a diamond and then again into another orb. Quick input chains like this can be forgiving early in Celeste, but demand perfection later. I love how high that makes the skill cap for precision movement (and I can\u2019t wait to see my best times destroyed by speedrunners) but it can also sometimes make the absolute peak of Celeste\u2019s hardest levels feel pretty punishing.   That said, I haven\u2019t found one I couldn\u2019t eventually beat with enough practice. Every time I died I could feel myself refining my strategy just a little bit. I would slowly dial in the angle of a jump or the timing of a pause, all the while getting more consistent at whatever parts came before that tricky bit. I\u2019d occasionally have a breakthrough in those tough spots as well, fundamentally rethinking how I was coming at a jump and making it much easier as a result, proving that Celeste\u2019s platforming requires smart thinking along with quick control. It makes beating these levels feel truly earned and immensely gratifying.  This is the type of game where you get better through doing and expanding your knowledge of the possibilities, not by powering up your character or getting new abilities. Growing and improving felt natural because Celeste is simple enough that it barely has to teach you its controls, but is still nuanced and complex in how you use them. After I had tackled a few of the B-Sides, going back to earlier chapters put that growth into clear perspective. They almost felt trivial compared to the new challenges I had faced in the meantime, and it reminded me how achievable completing Celeste\u2019s story chapters really are amid the high skill cap of its end-game - which is great, because it\u2019s worth playing even for those uninterested in pushing themselves further.  Jumping Simulator  Celeste\u2019s story starts out cute, with quirky characters and a clear goal for Madeline: climb to the peak of Celeste Mountain. Even though its garbled dialogue voices are a bit silly at first, their changing pitch and intonation (and the shifting portraits that come along with those voices) make each character extremely emotive and relatable. The characters Madeline meets along the way are lovable and funny; and while all of that sets Celeste up to be quite light-hearted, its story actually tackles some very real and important subjects.   Hidden under this challenging platformer\u2019s adorable exterior is a game about depression and anxiety. It\u2019s a hauntingly modern tale about being anxious and unhappy and never really knowing why, feeling like you just want to run away from how the world makes you feel. In this case, running away from social media and work and all the mistakes you\u2019ve made takes the form of climbing a mountain, but really it\u2019s just about doing anything crazy enough that it might shake you out of the rut you\u2019re in.  Celeste blends its story beautifully into the arcade-y game that houses it, making me feel for its characters without ever forcing me to. \u201c  It\u2019s a feeling that hit close to home for me at multiple points throughout Celeste, and one I\u2019m willing to bet many others will relate to as well. But Madeline\u2019s story isn\u2019t all about running: it\u2019s also about standing your ground in the face of the parts of yourself that scare you, and how learning to understand those parts is the only way to stop them from controlling you. None of these messages felt heavy-handed, and it\u2019s all conveyed through the lens of a world full of magic and adventure, but its core message is very down to Earth.  There aren\u2019t many games out there that feature two characters having a candid discussion about what depression feels like, or that depict a panic attack as tentacles attacking your character. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting that from a pixelated platformer where you collect flying strawberries and can magically dash through the air, but Celeste blends its story beautifully into the arcade-y game that houses it, making me feel for its characters without ever forcing me to.  As I read it, one of its chapters is a veiled metaphor for being in a bad or abusive relationship, while another is an allegory for how people can be consumed and trapped by social media. Maybe I'm reading too much into these levels, because those themes are thankfully never thrown directly in your face, but my interpretations of them were relatable and real either way.   Even though the story feels like a core part of Celeste, much of the heavier dialogue can be skipped past and ignored if you choose, and there\u2019s an option to skip every cutscene entirely. That means people who just want the white-knuckle platforming Celeste offers with none of the emotional baggage can easily have it that way. Alternatively, an Assist Mode can be turned on to make that platforming significantly easier, allowing you to do things like play in slow motion or gain more climbing stamina, so people who want to experience the story but can\u2019t make it up the mountain on their own will have a chance to do so as well.  That said, the way Celeste balances these two parts of itself by default is flawless. I cared deeply about Madeline\u2019s struggle and empathized with her in a way I wasn\u2019t expecting. That emotional struggle ties beautifully into some of Celeste\u2019s better platforming sequences as well, occasionally pushing the pace of the level into a frantic rush that made my heart race along with Madeline\u2019s - that speed and emotion being stoked by the soundtrack behind it.  The strength of Celeste\u2019s story and the honesty with which it tells it transforms this game from simply being one of the best platformers I\u2019ve played this decade into one of the most important ones as well. It effortlessly sneaks hard conversations about emotional and psychological health - important conversations that games don\u2019t often have - into a game that\u2019s still a phenomenal amount of fun without them."

        "Subtitle": "How not to do a racing game. Ocean/Imagineer's GT is one racer N64 owners can do without.",
        "Content": "Imagineer's last racer for N64, MRC offered a cool mixture of both off- and on-road racing. Unfortunately, the excellent track layouts and pleasing arcade physics were ultimately marred by three major flaws: The lack of tracks, blurry graphics, and a boring two-player mode. When we first heard about the semi-sequel, GT64 Championship Edition, and saw the first screen-shots, we were excited. Surely Imagineer had learned from its mistakes in MRC and would serve up a deep, challenging racer. Unfortunately, the truth is that GT64 is a worse game than MRC.  Gameplay GT 64 handles much differently from MRC. The steering and vehicle physics are more in tune with Sony's Grand Turismo . You won't be able to speed through tight turns without easing up on the gas pedal and strategically follow the (invisible) racing line. Players choose from 14 official GT racing teams with their fully licensed cars (Supra, NSX, and more). Before jumping into the races, you can tweak transmission, steering, brakes, tires, suspension, spoilers and the gear ratio. So far, so good But once you jump into the races, you will probably be appalled by what you see. You drive against seven other cars in the one-player mode, of which you will see a maximum of three on screen at the same time. The handling and car graphics aren't even all that bad \u00bf--but everything else is simply sub par. MRC was fun, right? But it was also dreadfully short. Three tracks simply won't last very long. So how many does GT64 have, a game released in late 1998? Three. To be fair, there is a short and a long version of each track (Japan, Europe, USA) -- but almost every other N64 racer has 10 or more tracks nowadays or at least offers different road conditions to make things more interesting. GT64 simply doesn't have what it takes in the gameplay department. Once you have driven each course once, it gets boring faster than staring into a tub of lard. It doesn't help that GT64's Championship Mode forces you to qualify for each race by driving a full three laps on the often over-long tracks in an attempt to prolong the play experience. Sorry, but racing three tracks alone on the same track over and over again before racing the same tracks for another three laps against a gang of lacking AI drones is not our idea of fun. The two-player (vs. only) mode is even worse, with slow controls and choppy framerates. No steering wheel support, either.  Graphics Some games have amazing music, causing the graphics engine to slow down a little. Other games draw tons of cars and track detail on screen which causes the engine to slow down. Some run in hi-res or feature specular highlighting, lots of alpha-channeled objects, reflection mapping or lightsourcing and in response run a little slower. GT64 has none of these features. Heck, it doesn't even have music during gameplay. We're still not sure why this game has such abysmal framerates, but trust us when we're saying that MRC runs a whole lot faster. To make things worse, GT64 is blurry and riddled with tons of pop-up and sloppily designed textures that don't quite line up. Weather conditions? Uh, sure. How about some grey fog? What a shame. The cars actually look quite good and the hood-view camera option is excellent.  Sound Bad music, but only during the menu and opening screens. As soon as the game starts, all you hear is the whining of the engines, which isn't even that great. Apart from that, there's tire screeching and the occasional \"tock\" if you hit an obstacle. GT64 will not be remembered for its sound either, that's for sure.",

        "Content": "Few companies have the wealth of recognizable and exciting characters required to create a platform fighter that could rival the likes of Nintendo\u2019s Super Smash Bros. series. With the help of developer Player First Games, Warner Bros. is trying to use the seemingly endless list of movie and TV studios it owns to do just that, bringing together an eclectic roster of fan-favorite characters that somehow includes Harley Quinn , Bugs Bunny , and Shaggy all at once. While the result makes for some gleeful multiplayer chaos, MultiVersus is ambitious in its laser focus on competitive multiplayer too. That\u2019s left some of the more casual aspects undercooked, but its prioritization of 2v2 online matches still makes for a fresh take on an increasingly crowded genre. Unlike last year\u2019s competent yet underwhelming Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl , MultiVersus clearly has significant support from the Warner Bros. family and, more importantly, the budget to follow through on Player First\u2019s vision. Not only are iconic faces like the DC superhero trinity of Superman , Batman , and Wonder Woman available to pilot, but so are characters from Steven Universe , The Iron Giant , and even Game of Thrones. The open beta\u2019s initial roster of 17 is a tad small for my taste, but I\u2019m not worried about it in the long term as the cast is already set to expand in the coming months \u2013 basketball and Space Jam superstar LeBron James was just added, and Rick and Morty are supposed to join him in August . MultiVersus Characters 20 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask While compact, the roster is diverse and brimming with personality thanks to its impressively faithful voice cast. Having actors like John DiMaggio (Jake the Dog), Kevin Conroy (Batman), Matthew Lillard (Shaggy), and Maisie Williams ( Arya Stark ) reprise their roles goes a long way toward making these characters feel authentic. It\u2019s great to hear the voices I remember from cartoons and movies I grew up on bantering with characters they\u2019ve never had the chance to meet before. Beyond the recognizable, I dig additions like Reindog, too, an original creation that opens up the possibility for more new faces to join the fray down the line. Puncha Some Buns Matches in MultiVersus play out as either 1v1, 2v2, or four-player free-for-all battles in places like a spooky Scooby Doo-inspired mansion or the gadget-ridden cavern of the Bat Cave. Unfortunately, the sparse selection of stages are bland and lack identity beyond those two standouts. The other three locations look like they could take place anywhere despite supposedly being based on memorable sites like the Adventure Time treehouse. Thankfully the music does help make up for this, and I look for any opportunity to brawl in the Sky Palace just to hear its wonderful instrumental cover of the Steven Universe theme. Like in Smash Bros., your goal is to build up damage on your opponent in order to make it easier to send them flying off into the void at the edge of the screen for a kill. Characters have two attack buttons to work with, representing normal hits and flashier special attacks, with different moves performed by pointing the analog stick up, down, or to the side while unleashing an attack. It\u2019s recognizable, but a well-executed system, and controlling your character is as quick and fluid as I\u2019d hope the chaotic gameplay of a platform fighter would be. Controlling your character is as quick and fluid as I'd hope. \u201c I almost always feel in complete control, which can be attributed to the tight mobility options available to most of the roster. You can use double jumps and dodges to navigate the airspace, escape danger, avoid projectiles, or line up a devastating assault of your own. A change from the norm is a lack of ledge grabbing, which is why Player First has opted to enable wall jumps that make for exciting, daring saves by sticking to the side of the main platform and leaping to safety instead of falling to your doom. Another big departure is that the 2v2 mode is meant to be the main way to play, making MultiVersus refreshing and setting it apart from its peers. These team battles are a lot of fun, with each character assigned a class that promotes a specific playstyle to help compliment a partner. Whether that\u2019s the frontline tanks, the hard-hitting bruisers, the agile and deadly assassins, or the trickier ranged mages and support classes; everyone has a role to play in a fight, and your team composition can be vital to succeeding against experienced challengers. It\u2019s great fun discovering how Bugs Bunny and his toon gimmicks pair with the protection and crowd control provided by Wonder Woman\u2019s moves. While I naturally gravitated towards tanks like Superman and The Iron Giant, I\u2019ve also been having a blast learning the intricacies of playing support as Steven Universe and learning about each character to be a better teammate. Rollback Netcode With how important the online modes are to MultiVersus, the rollback netcode running remote multiplayer sessions has to be great, and it has been across most of the well over 100 matches I have under my belt. A large majority of fights have played out with smooth and responsive controls on PC and Xbox, both with wired and wireless connections. I have run into some issues online, although it\u2019s fewer than I can count on one hand. However, in those rare times when a connection is bad, it\u2019s chaotic and near unplayable, with characters warping around the stage or running aimlessly off a cliff only to appear a few seconds later just yards away. Thankfully, moments like that are the exception rather than the rule. You can equip up to four different perks before every match, adding a level of customization to enhance your playstyle, support your partner, or even try to counter your opponents\u2019 team. Three of those can be perks that affect attributes like movement speed or damage dealt, which is amplified in power if your teammate equips the same one. Signature perks fill the fourth slot, modifying specific character attacks and abilities, such as leaving flame walls in the wake of Iron Giant\u2019s jet boosters or Taz hacking up an anvil if he eats an enemy projectile. Perks add a meaningful layer of strategy to each match that I appreciate in every mode, but especially when I\u2019m playing alongside someone I can build a gameplan with. The unfortunate side effect of that focus on competitive 2v2 is the absence of meaningful local multiplayer options. Currently, you can play with up to four people on one device in team battles and free-for-alls, just like online, but there isn\u2019t enough here to keep my interest with friends if I want to have a chaotic anything-goes party experience. Items occasionally populate in the FFA game type, but none of the rocks, dynamite, and ice weapons are remotely entertaining to use or add surprising moments to the mayhem that\u2019s already playing out. Local multiplayer also means the lack of stages is more glaring, making MultiVersus a disappointing game for casual fun overall. A Caboodle of Collectables Characters and perks have to be unlocked, but thankfully MultiVersus takes a big step in the right direction when it comes to free-to-play fighting game monetization.  While the free-to-play model comes with a lot of negative connotations and possible pitfalls, it also has the potential to be a boon for fighting games by allowing more people to casually try a game without having to drop a dime on it if they don\u2019t want to. And crucially, Player First has ensured everything that affects gameplay is accessible simply by playing, avoiding any pay-to-win concerns. Perks are only unlocked either by leveling up characters or by spending the free gold currency that\u2019s earned from playing matches and completing various daily missions and reward tracks. Characters, on the other hand, can be bought with gold, the real-money premium currency called Gleamium, or Character Tickets which are available to those who buy the optional founders packs. Only four characters are unlocked from the start, but I\u2019ve found playing just a couple of hours will earn enough gold to unlock someone new. There\u2019s a nice pace to learning a character or two and then moving on to a new one when you have enough gold. Gleamium and Premium Item Pricing Gleamium can be purchased in bundles of 450 ($4.99), 1000 ($9.99), 2200 ($19.99), and 6000 ($49.99). Variant costumes currently can cost 500, 800, 1500, or 2000 Gleamium depending on the rarity, and characters are each 700 Gleamium if you want to forgo paying the 1500-3000 free Gold. Character emotes can cost 200, 350, or 500 Gleamium depending on whether it's uncommon, rare, or epic rarity, respectively. Ringout animations are 800 Gleamium for rare and 1200 Gleamium for epic items. That means pretty much no matter what item you are looking to buy, the Gleamium bundles won't quite line up with the price. Do you buy cosmetic items with real money in free-to-play games? Yes, regularly Sometimes, but not often No, never Answer See Results Gleamium is also used to unlock multiple cosmetic items like character variant costumes, emotes, profile icons, ringout animations, and more. These cosmetics are fun, especially the skins that change the entire aesthetic of a character down to the voice lines, like the Cake the Cat costume for Jake. However, some of the pricing on these items don\u2019t align well with the bundles of Gleamium that can be purchased, which forces you to buy more than needed \u2013 that\u2019s not a new business practice, but it\u2019s still a lame one. If you want to invest in Luau Velma or a Batman: The Animated Series skin, it\u2019ll cost you. They\u2019re by no means necessary to purchase, but if the right skin comes around, such as Black Lantern Superman, I\u2019ll definitely be tempted to swag out my main fighter if the price is right. Not every cosmetic costs Gleamium, and there are other ways to snag some of these items in the free and premium season pass rewards and by leveling up each character. I love that these reasons to keep playing and engaging exist even if I\u2019m not throwing down money."

        "Content": "When Sonic Riders released at the tail end of the GameCube lifespan, it wasn't exactly met with the highest of regards from fans or critics alike.  The gameplay was simple, the design was a bit flawed in the control department, and the end result was a racer that, while certainly a fresh take on the Sonic brand, wasn't a vital piece of software.  With the now-amazing success of the Wii, as well as the continuing strong sales of PS2, SEGA is back with another dose of racing with Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity .  The end result, however, is more of the same, mixed with a few gameplay concepts that don't quite come through in the end.  Only the most die-hard of Sonic fans need apply.  Just like its predecessor, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity is essentially a racing game built in the world of Sonic the Hedgehog.  Since the design ends up having little to do with anything Sonic-related at all (speed aside, of course) the game ends up feeling a lot like Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, as you're basically getting a new experience teamed with classic characters.  As for the story, it's pretty basic, centering around a new gravity-manipulating bracelet that the Blue Blur finds.  With an evil entity out to capture it, it's up to the Sonic Team to do what they do best: Embrace speed, and raise hell.  The level design is interesting, but the sense of speed isn't.  Putting all story aspects aside, Zero Gravity is basically the same design as the original Sonic Riders experience.  You'll sprint through courses, grab rings, power up your air board \u2013 why the fastest animal alive doesn't just run is beyond us\u2026- and attempt to take first place in some of the craziest track design since Extreme G on the N64.  Where the original fell short, however, Zero Gravity again fails, as the air board mechanic is a bit too slow for our liking (nowhere near the intensity of something like F-Zero GX), and the control is very clunky, using Wii tilt or PS2 analog stick to control a very slippery, floaty character at high speeds.  For whatever reason, the steering isn't tight enough overall, so characters like Knuckles will often run into walls simply because they can't turn fast enough, and Wii tilt users will find that movement with the remote needs to be far more exaggerated than most games, yielding less turnout as well for their efforts.  Even Sonic and the Secret Rings had tighter controls than Zero Gravity's end design.  In addition to the new story and tilt control on Wii, Zero Gravity also makes use of some new gameplay mechanics, specifically those dealing with the \"Gravity\" part of the game's title.  Sonic's new gravity-changing bracelet allows him and his team the ability to stop time, launching into a bullet time effect that lets you reposition yourself for a quick turn, or latch onto a wall track for alternate routes.  Replacing the classic turbo boost from the first game, players can now rocket at full speed into a huge turn, flip into Zero Gravity mode, reposition themselves, and then boost out of free space again in a new direction.  The idea works, but without an overall boost ability the entire experience feels a bit slower now, as you won't be cashing in trick points for turbo, but instead use it to actually slow the game down as you make more precise movements.  There is a new boost maneuver as well, but it's treated more as a state-change than an actual turbo meter.  When engaged your racer will actually fly through the air, making use of tilt control or analog (PS2) movements to fly through the level, gaining additional boost off of floating world objects that become unhinged from the world when you enter flight mode.  Since movement is amazingly limited when in this state, however, you'll only want to use it in key areas on each map (sections that are actually marked with a boost icon, actually), so for general racing you're still left without any turbo boost, instead using a once-per-lap technique in its place.  The end result is a slower, less free-form experience, and one we'd certainly put below the first Riders effort.   Zero Gravity also incorporates a new \"gear upgrade\" system, which cashes in rings for on-the-fly upgrades to your racer.  This is an awesome idea in general, but we'd like to see the execution done in a different manor, as it is way too simple.  Each rider has three abilities to power-up, which are predetermined by the computer, and the payout isn't drastic enough overall.  Speed boosts don't do a ton for the riders, and techniques such as rail-grinding now need a specific number of rings to be unlocked, usually making shortcut areas unavailable until later laps.  Also included are character vehicles, such as an upgraded air board for Tails or hover-cycle for Knuckles, and while the vehicles again allow for alternate paths, they actually control stiffer and feel slower overall, adding even more weight onto our \"not tight enough, not fast enough\" stance on the game.  Gear upgrades are a great idea, but they're too simple and uneventful for our tastes.  On the visual front, not much has changed either, as you'll still get a mix of decent level design, some impressive CG work (Sonic Team is always known for that), but some overly generic designs as well, with the new enemy characters from Zero Gravity looking extremely simple.  Also, since you're constantly \"fighting\" against an army of drones rather than a group of classic Sonic characters, the race loses some of its \"Sonic\" feel.  That being said, the framerate holds up, the visuals keep a vibrant, stylistic feel throughout, and it's one of the slicker looking SEGA titles thus far on Wii and PS2.  If only it had the speed and control to team with its looks.  As far as online goes, Zero Gravity offers worldwide leaderboards, but no actual online competition.  This should have been a no-brainer for both Wii and PS2, as Nintendo has opened up online for developers months ago, and PS2 has allowed it for years.  There's still local play and over 15 racers to choose from (each with  their own boards and vehicles), but in the end the game comes up short to say the least. "

        "Content": "It's pretty safe to say Dino D-Day is a different kind of World War II shooter, mostly because it features dinosaurs. The resurrected beasts serve the Nazis and join the fight to overwhelm Allied forces in multiplayer combat arenas. It's a great concept for an online shooter and results in all kinds of inane humor, like ducking under a sheep tossed by a Dilophosaurus while sprinting by a poster of a benevolent Hitler cradling a baby dinosaur. But as much potential as there is to have fun jumping around as a Velociraptor while an Allied soldier tries to shoot you down with a Thompson sub machinegun, Dino D-Day just doesn't play very well.  The faults are many, from the map designs to the controls to the classes. Digital Ranch gives unique abilities to each of the twelve classes, three of which are Nazi dinosaurs. To compensate for their inability to reload guns, the dinosaurs have different ways to attack and varied movement speeds. Meanwhile the rest of the available combat classes are human and rely on traditional weapons and a few special abilities, from medkits to calling in airstrikes in the form of flying, exploding pterosaurs.    Since the premise of the game is totally ludicrous to begin with, it's within reason that the Allied Jack Hardgrave class gets magically powered-up fists after three consecutive kills, and that the Ilona Vike class can toss a jackrabbit onto the field to distract any nearby Velociraptors. The larger issue is the guns, from the rifles to the SMGs, doesn't feel particularly responsive or powerful, and the presence of dinosaurs significantly throws off the balance of combat.  For a game where dinosaurs are the major draw, only three controllable dino classes don't feel like enough. The Desmatoschus is essentially a walking tank with irritatingly imprecise aiming that makes consistently hitting targets more of a chore than it should be. Its slow movement speed makes it an easy target on purpose, but also makes it one of the most boring classes in the game. The Velociraptor and Dilophosaurus are by comparison much more interesting, mostly because they both get instant kill attacks. Aside from the bullets fired from guns the Raptor is the fastest thing on the map, which is especially frustrating when it high jumps over a barrier, pounces on your face and instant-kills you with a lethal bite to the neck.  The Dilophosaurus can scoop up sheep and launch them at targets and ram into Allied soldiers, scoop them up in its mouth, then toss the mandible-bound victim into another for a follow-up kill. It's a bigger target than the Velociraptor so it can't avoid bullets as effectively, but it can easily get stuck in doorways and other tight spaces thanks to a sloppily implemented third-person view.    Save for those fortunate enough to be carrying a spare jackrabbit, the Allied soldiers don't seem especially well-equipped to handle a coordinated dinosaur rush. It can make for unpredictable gameplay for all the wrong reasons, especially on maps where the action is funneled into areas too tight to accommodate any kind of orderly fighting. This is especially true in the King of the Hill map types where you'll frequently see pterosaur bombs spammed at the single capture area or an entire team camped out around the one or two points of interest on the Objective maps. It dissolves the usefulness of most of the class abilities, turning combat into chaos.  Perhaps chaotic combat is realistic. If dinosaurs were to actually roam the battlefield with guns strapped to their shells and primed to launch sheep from their mouths at a moment's notice, I'm pretty sure even the most well-trained soldiers would freak out. Yet this game clearly isn't about realism, and the systems built in to provide balance between sides don't maintain traction when the bullets start to fly.    What Digitial Ranch did manage to do quite well is build in a sense of humor. Allied soldiers will make Jurassic Park references after being killed, maps are littered with Nazi dinosaur propaganda posters, and nothing can quite match the sight of seeing a gigantic lumbering styracosaurus blasting shoulder mounted turrets across the Fortress Objective map. The writing throughout, though not the focus of the game, is well done, with some great descriptions in the fake newspapers on loading screens and impressive attention to detail, such as how the Desmatosuchus fires its back-mounted gun by biting down on a strap running through its mouth.  Bugs, lag and a tiny player base also affect the experience. Often there aren't more than 30 players online at any given time split across two servers, which is usually enough to get only one decent game going. For a multiplayer-only game, the low player numbers is something to consider if the premise is enough to make you want to play. To date the game has also remained glitchy, with a strange bug popping up from time to time that turns players into floating guns."

        "Content": "Colonizing planets has to be one of the hardest tasks for anyone in the future.  Take, for example, the world in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition .  Not only would a worker have to make their way out there, they'd have to deal with the incredibly harsh climates of the world.  But that's the least of the colonists' problems. Indigenous aliens are vigorously fighting their advances, setting up a fierce struggle for survival.  Initially released on the 360 last January and followed up on the PC, Lost Planet has come to chill on the PS3.  However, if you're expecting a solid port over with new features, you'll be extremely disappointed.  Just in case you don't know the premise of Lost Planet, the game is set on E.D.N. III, a distant planet that humans have attempted to colonize. Not particularly idyllic by any stretch of the imagination, E.D.N. III is covered in ice and incredibly cold snowstorms, making the establishment of cities and outposts difficult.  However, as humans expanded their territory, they discover that E.D.N. III is infested with a strange insect like race known as the Akrid that are incredibly aggressive.  Surprisingly, however, the Akrid naturally produce some strange viscous fluid known as thermal energy (or T-Eng), which can keep humans reasonably warm.  It also can be used to power giant mechanized suits known as Vital Suits, which humans use to defend themselves and further their fight against the Akrid.    Click here to watch the video feature.   Players are cast as Wayne, a young man who is suffering from amnesia thanks to a massive Akrid attack.  The last thing that he remembers was a gigantic worm-like Akrid known as Green Eye, who killed his father in front of him and knocked him into a coma.  Discovered by a small group of snow pirates, Wayne seeks revenge against the mysterious beasts.  However, he quickly discovers a larger problem on E.D.N. III than he ever knew; huge groups of Akrid are being seen and a mysterious group known as Nevec appear to have dangerous plans for the planet.  The plot of the game is convoluted and nonsensical, but it's primarily there to give you a context for blasting your way across the title's eleven stages in the single player campaign.  What makes Lost Planet mildly tactical in its approach is the fact that players can choose to move through these stages on foot or within a VS suit.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages that you'll need to take into account.  Using a VS gives you access to jump jets, gigantic lasers and chainguns, as well as the ability to absorb a lot of punishment. Unfortunately, players can potentially die if their VS is heavily damaged and they can't escape it before it explodes.  By contrast, moving on foot allows you to use a grappling hook to reach high platforms or cross gaps, but leaves you vulnerable to getting blasted very easily.  Take enough damage and you'll quickly expire in the middle of battles. However, if you happen to have some extra thermal energy, you can heal damage, preventing death for at least a few seconds.   Wayne's ready to bring the pain. Unlike other games, where you can store up energy to be used at your discretion, you'll find that your thermal energy is constantly dropping from the environmental conditions, always forcing you to seek out new sources of T-Eng to power yourself and your suit.  Some of this can be done by targeting the glowing spots on Akrid, quickly weakening the beasts and leaving their thermal fluid on the ground for you to pick up.  Other sources can be found by destroying storage tanks, vehicles and explosive barrels, which can provide a boost for Wayne.  Part of the problem, however, comes in the fact that players will frequently find so many environmental objects containing large sources of T-Eng that you don't always have to engage in battle.  It will make some stages a bit more challenging, particularly on higher difficulty levels where energy loss is much faster, but you can literally pick and choose your fights.  In fact, you can run away from most, if not all of the Akrid if you want, collect energy from \"safer\" objects and run off to the boss fight in a stage.  While that isn't fully exploring the levels themselves, it doesn't extend the gameplay or add to the depth of the game.    This port of Lost Planet hasn't addressed any of these issues from the previous two versions.  For example, the control is still wonky -- Wayne still can't look straight up, and while you've got buttons to swing your perspective 90 degrees to the left or the right, you'll still wind up fighting the controls to make Wayne do exactly what you want or need him to do in the middle of huge battles.  Then again, the same can be argued for VS control, which is not particularly responsive or agile.  Being juggled by enemies is still an incredibly frustrating and irritating experience within the game, especially by turrets or enemy VS units that pound rocket after rocket at your position, killing your chances of getting up.  All of these should've been fixed by now, considering that this is the third release of the game on a console.  Two other significant issues exist that point out how weak of a port this game is.  The first is the inclusion of coins or targets that are scattered across the game landscape.  For the 360, these coins related to achievement points that you could get for your gamertag.  Unfortunately, instead of translating these achievements into PS3 accomplishments, collecting these coins does absolutely nothing within the game.  It doesn't unlock additional levels, it doesn't unlock additional VSes and it doesn't provide additional features for multiplayer.  That's pretty weak, especially considering that Devil May Cry 4, the other recent Capcom title, featured accomplishments on the PS3 that were identical to that of the 360.    The other issue is the insane amount of slowdown and frame rate drop.  By now, since the game has been released on two different systems, you'd expect slowdown issues to be kept to a minimum, if it occurs at all.  Not the case -- Lost Planet seems to crawl if you get more than five enemies on screen at once, and considering that the game frequently swarms you with Akrid monsters, this doesn't work well at all. The longest one that I noticed was close to 30 seconds in the middle of a battle, as I was facing off against Akrid and Nevec soldiers at the same time.  That's pretty bad.  That brings me to another problem however, which is that the game doesn't look good, especially if you've seen it on other systems.  Compared to the 360 version and the PC, everything on the PS3 version looks like its run through a gauzy, pixilated filter.  Instead of finely detailed textures, many of the game environments have blocky, rough textures and heavily aliased edges.  Instead of fine particles for smoke or snow, the particle system is harsh and weakly defined.  Character models look somewhat out of focus or blocky, especially when you are running through battlefields. It doesn't feel as though the game takes advantage of the PS3 at all.   I am the Exterminator. This is particularly true when it comes to the multiplayer maps, many of which have been carried over to the PS3 from the downloadable expansion packs from Xbox Live.  The ground textures look extremely basic, the water demonstrates little to no physics whatsoever with bland texture work as well, and the game arenas don't look good either.  What's more, online gameplay suffers from framerate drops with as few as two players in a battle.  We were playing a game of Post Grab on our network in the office and noticed multiple hitches as we faced off against each other. While there are a few new character skins that are included for multiplayer, including Frank West from Dead Rising, Mega Man (which looks like Frank squeezed into the suit) and Luka, these aren't necessarily enough to make you feel like you're gaining anything extra or special with this game."

        "Content": "Let\u2019s start here: Sportsfriends is the most exciting local multiplayer game since Wii Sports set your parents\u2019 living room on fire in 2006. That\u2019s not the remarkable thing about Sportsfriends, though; what\u2019s remarkable is that it manages to bring four disparate styles of gameplay together into one cohesive package that caters to casual partygoers and committed players alike. The rather demanding hardware and space requirements might limit which games you can play, but your living room will be filled with raucous laughter and yelling just the same. Sportsfriends\u2019 four games mostly walk the fine line of being simple enough to learn quickly--for optimal controller exchanging at big parties--while offering an incredible amount of depth for the ultra-competitive. This point is driven home especially well by Johann Sebastian Joust and BaraBariBall, Sportsfriends\u2019 two best games. Johann Sebastian Joust reminds me of the playground games of my childhood, feeling like a blend of tag and musical chairs. It ditches the TV altogether, and instead has you moving around in real space trying to shake your opponent\u2019s Move controller enough to knock them out of the game. Fully enjoying Johann Sebastian Joust isn\u2019t easy thanks to needing Move controllers for every participant (you can use the less-responsive DualShock 4 controllers, but it isn\u2019t recommended) and plenty of space to run around, but it\u2019s entirely worth the trouble. Carefully grasping the glowing Move controller while attempting to knock your opponent\u2019s around is like a calculated game of chicken, where moving in to attack also leaves you vulnerable. The controller becomes less sensitive when the music speeds up, urging you to attack, and intelligently injecting a dose of frantic urgency. With jousters encircled by spectators waiting for their turns, it also looks entertainingly similar to a Michael Jackson music video. Back on the couch, the other standout is BaraBariBall. which has up to four people beat the crap out of each other as they try to toss a ball into their designated section of water beneath the level. I found the immediate chaos to be incredibly fun, but soon, strategies began to develop. Moving, attacking, and throwing became precise as I found better ways to score without giving my opponents time to intercept the ball. The depth of play is amplified by the three different playable characters, each with its own unique stats and abilities, and the variety of stages that require distinct planning. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see competitive BaraBariBall played at fighting game tournaments. It really is that deep. Tag, you're it! The final two games are fun in their own right, but its hard for them to escape the looming shadow of Johann Sebastian Joust and BaraBariBall. Hokra is a super-abstracted game of two-on-two basketball that seems straight forward at first, but becomes incredibly competitive as you master the ability to bank passes to teammates off of walls. Super Pole Riders\u2019 analog stick controls take a few matches to get comfortable with, but once you master using your pole to block opponents\u2019 movement, and nudge the ball out of your opponent\u2019s reach, knocking opponents off their poles; there\u2019s plenty of freedom to playfully troll your friends. The future of the Olympics? The \u201cs\u201d on the end of Sportsfriends is of importance; these four minigames are much better with a group than a single friend, and one, Hokra, even requires four players. Additionally, none of Sportsfriends\u2019 games have options for a single player. There are no AI opponents, online matches, high score challenges, or any other type of mode for the friend-challenged. This means you\u2019re going to need lots of people and controllers to really get the most out of it. Super Pole Riders and Hokra try to bridge the gap with an option for two players to each share a controller, but it proves to be rather unwieldy. Catch! Oh, and if you own both a PS3 and PS4, go with the PS3 version. The PS4 version only supports up to four bluetooth devices at once, where the PS3 handles seven.. Four players is certainly enough to have a good time, but the more players, the more fun and chaotic Johann Sebastian Joust becomes."

        "Content": "Another year, another iPhone. For many, the new iPhone 12 is going to be the baseline smartphone to consider. With a starting price of $799 for the 64GB model, the iPhone 12 is a bit more expensive than last year\u2019s iPhone 11, leaving room for the iPhone 12 Mini to fit in at the $699 price point (though it\u2019s $729 unlocked). A few upgrades to the iPhone 12 do help justify the increased price and it practically steals the show from the iPhone 12 Pro , but let's see if the new phone can earn its keep. iPhone 12 Review 14 Images  Design and Features The iPhone 12 will look fairly familiar with a design that\u2019s largely reminiscent of last year\u2019s model. Apple has changed the aluminum frame of the phone, giving it a flat edge that harkens back to the iPhone 4 . The phone feels wide in my hand, a bit wider than the Samsung Galaxy S20 or Sony Xperia V II, but the boxy edges make for a more secure grip than I expected. Apple has actually managed to trim down the size of the iPhone 12 from its predecessor. It narrowed the bezels around the display slightly and used that extra space to shrink the chassis. The screen remains 6.1 inches diagonally, but Apple has packed in the Super Retina XDR display, which increases the resolution to 2,532 x 1,170 and uses OLED technology, making for a considerable upgrade that helps merit the price hike. Which phone platform are you on? iOS Android Harmony OS (Huawei) Windows Phone holdout Symbian all day Answer See Results The new screen looks delicious, with more than enough brightness for sunny days and rich colors. But, anyone coming from an iPhone 11 Pro won\u2019t find much different. Regrettably, the iPhone 12 continues to feature the prominent notch at the top of the screen. It\u2019s still a bit of an eyesore, as I\u2019ve found it much harder to overlook than the small camera cutouts found on many competing Android phones . I find the amount of information I\u2019m able to get squeezed in at either side of the notch isn\u2019t worth much. While many smartphone manufacturers have gone through several iterations of their display cutout, it\u2019s disappointing to see Apple stuck with the same design it introduced three generations ago with the iPhone X . On the plus side, the sensors in that notch are quick to recognize my face, even in dark conditions.  Some of Apple\u2019s design upgrades aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye. For one, the new line of phones all feature 5G connectivity. In major metropolitan areas, this can be a considerable perk. For most, it won\u2019t mean much. Even with the prevalence of 5G in Chicago, I rarely find myself in an area that offers speeds above those I can get with 4G LTE. Still, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have on a phone that for many customers may last several years, especially as 5G coverage continues to roll out across the country. Another hidden change are the materials. The display is now covered in \u201cCeramic Shield,\u201d which Apple claims is tougher than any smartphone glass. I haven\u2019t dropped the phone onto the ground, but other reviewers have tested it and found it more robust than at least the previous iPhone glass. The back glass doesn\u2019t get this upgrade though. Hiding inside the iPhone 12 is a MagSafe magnetic ring. There\u2019s little I can say about this, as all it did in my review was detect when I had put a plastic case on. Additional accessories and wireless chargers will make better use of this feature though, allowing accessories to easily snap into place. On their own, though, the magnets don\u2019t change much about the phone in general use. They are relatively weak and won\u2019t let you stick your phone to every metal surface in your home.  There are two things Apple has done (or not done) that are hard to forgive. With 64GB of base storage, there\u2019s not a lot of room. I\u2019ve only used my review unit for a couple weeks and I\u2019m already using 25.9GB of space. Some 4K videos, a few large games, some downloaded Netflix movies, and a large photo collection, and I\u2019d be in real trouble at 64GB. It\u2019s only an extra $50 to move up to 128GB, and it\u2019s probably worth it, but that feels like a high price when I can get a 64GB microSD card for $9. The second thing Apple did was remove the charging brick from the box. That much is forgivable, but Apple also switched from a Lightning-to-USB-A cable to cable that terminates in a USB-C connection. So, while you can plug the iPhone 12 into any of your old cables, you can plug the new cable into exactly none of your old iPhone charging bricks. Either the new cable is kind of useless or all the old charging bricks are kind of useless. As an environmental effort, Apple\u2019s move feels ill-conceived. (Never mind the push toward wireless charging with MagSafe, a power delivery method that will use more energy to charge your phone than a wire would).   Software The iPhone 12 ships with iOS 14. Having not used Apple\u2019s mobile operating system in a long time, I was curious to see how well I could adjust. iOS 14 proved fairly easy to adapt to coming from using Android phones. Swipe navigation makes sense and works comparable to Android\u2019s own implementation, and I found some familiarity in the Notification Center and utilities page. iOS 14 gets tedious with how particular it is about where on the screen I swipe from and how far I swipe. It makes one-handed navigation difficult. Availability of swipe navigation is also inconsistent, as some pages require use of a back button instead (which isn\u2019t always easy to find). Aside from this shortcoming, navigation is quick and fluid. Though Apple hasn\u2019t introduced a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate with the latest phones, I\u2019ve heard many of my fellow reviewers comment on Apple\u2019s notable fluidity even at 60Hz. I\u2019m inclined to agree that everything feels smooth, including scrolling, and is fairly responsive. Though I think some of that sense stems from something of a speed limit in iOS. Many times while trying to scroll up and down a page, the rate of scrolling felt much slower than I was aiming for.  iOS 14 has come with a number of new features and tweaks that aim to improve the overall experience. Those include an App Library, more compact UI elements (particularly Siri and ongoing calls), upgraded Widgets, and App Clips. The App Library is meant to offer a convenient place to look for all of your apps. Apple automatically groups apps into collections on the last page of the home screen. This is sensible in theory, but Apple\u2019s grouping isn\u2019t. In my case, Gmail and Google Voice show up in a box called \u201cProductivity and Finance.\u201d Meanwhile, all my other communication apps were in \u201cSocial.\u201d Chrome and Safari were in \u201cUtilities\u201d alongside Watch, Measure, and the App Store. Books, Pocket Casts, Tips, and Translate were maybe reasonably in \u201cInformation & Reading,\u201d but Weather felt like an odd inclusion. I love app folders and use them extensively on Android. Having a screen dedicated to them on iOS could be handy, but Apple\u2019s implementation is weak and lacks any way to re-organize apps or re-name folders \u2013 surprising, since the home screen allows those folder customizations.  The new widgets could also be good in theory. They can now provide more data, and they can be placed on the home screen. But, I\u2019ve found they don\u2019t take much advantage of the ability to offer more data. Most of the widgets I\u2019ve seen are little more than shortcuts to perform an action within an app, and they almost all take up more space than they need. My widget to play the newest release in Pocket Casts takes up the space of four apps on the home screen, but most of the space is blank. Another widget I have for App recommendations takes up eight slots to show eight apps, and once placed it simply blended in with the home screen, so it\u2019s no longer apparent that those app shortcuts are actually in a widget. These are all features that could prove handy with further revision, but coming from Android, I feel like this is a game of catch up and Apple has just started running. iOS 14 is still capable, and I\u2019ve found it less prone to odd behavior than Android, albeit not immune (one day the screen shifted its brightness levels so the max brightness was fairly dim and its minimum brightness was nearly black. A reboot sorted it out). App Clips are a feature that comes with iOS 14, and they sound promising, but I haven\u2019t been able to test them out. They offer a way to run a small portion of an app without having to download the whole thing. I could see this being useful in some of Apple\u2019s suggested use-cases, such as at retailers or restaurants, as having a full app for everywhere I go would quickly become a mess.   Gaming and performance The iPhone 12 shares the same Apple A14 Bionic chipset found across all four phones in the line. Apple has long managed impressive performance out of its chips, and there\u2019s no lack of muscle in this case. Whether I was scrolling a large page of animated GIFs or gaming, the iPhone 12 didn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down. The GIF scrolling was actually impressive, as I\u2019ve often seen this kind of task hit some devices hard, as loading in new GIFs while continuing to play loaded ones takes a toll. That said, compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 running in the Samsung Galaxy S20, I see more or less similar performance. Apple has long managed impressive performance out of its chips, and there\u2019s no lack of muscle in this case \u201c Gaming does set Apple apart though. I played through the opening portion of That Game Company\u2019s Sky, a game I like to use for phone reviews as it\u2019s perhaps one of the most visually impressive smartphone games I\u2019ve seen. The iPhone 12 managed to make it even more stunning. It was incredibly smooth through my testing, with the iPhone 12 never getting more than a bit warm. The game looked great in its battery-saver mode, and the phone easily ran it with 60fps performance mode and 30fps quality modes. I occasionally noticed frame rates dropping in the performance mode, but they generally stayed high. Still, it\u2019s not quite the \u201coff the charts frames per second\u201d for \u201cconsole-quality gaming\u201d that Apple suggested during its launch presentation. Even though the Galaxy S20 had an easy time running the game as well, in a side-by-side comparison, the game visuals on the iPhone in all modes appear sharper, with better anti-aliasing and clearer surface textures.  Only the iPhone\u2019s storage and memory seemed to be weak points. Sky launched and levels loaded quicker on the Galaxy S20. Switching from the same point in the game to the home screen, opening one app (HBO Max), and then switching right back to the game also required the iPhone to relaunch the game while the S20 was able to resume from where I\u2019d left off. Fortunately, Apple\u2019s small battery isn\u2019t as much of an issue. I am not a heavy phone user from day to day, but do regularly check notifications, scroll Twitter, take photos, and listen to podcasts. I averaged over two hours of daily screen time in my last week of testing. With that level of activity, I easily could make it through two full days, and I even made it through three just to see if I could. It even managed two days when I did more extreme testing, like a number of 4K video tests, a 45-minute-long video call, and about 40-minutes of Sky gameplay (which only drained about 14% of the battery). Every user will have their own experience, but I\u2019d feel confident in the iPhone 12 surviving a whole day even if I was using it far more regularly. iPhone 12 Image Samples 22 Images  Camera The cameras haven\u2019t fundamentally changed this time around. Apple has claimed improved low-light performance, perhaps thanks to a wider aperture on the main wide-angle sensor, and I\u2019ve seen it perform well in that department. I snapped one photo at night on a dark street trying to capture a crane in the distance while a neon sign was lit up, and the camera did an excellent job handling that shot, adding a lot of extra visibility to what was a much darker scene in actuality.  The iPhone 12 cameras also make great products with strong lighting, offering life-like colors that often were a very close match for what I was seeing with my own eyes. From the main sensor, the images are wonderfully crisp. The ultra-wide camera isn\u2019t nearly as good. In the same setting, it produces much noisier and softer images. In low light, it gets even worse. Even though the camera proves capable of handling slight hand movement during long exposures, a quality shot on the primary sensor loses much of that quality when taken with the ultra-wide instead.  The main sensor\u2019s performance in both high- and low-light scenarios is a knack that it carries over into scenes with both. It handles a high dynamic-range thoroughly well, even capable of capturing all the detail on my poorly lit desk, outside my window during the daytime, and on my computer screen in one shot \u2013 a scenario many cameras would struggle with.  As in photos, so too in video. Basically, the strengths of the main sensor and the weaknesses of the ultra-wide are echoed in video. The iPhone 12 can record in up to 4K at up to 60fps, though it can quickly toggle between 1080p and 4K, and 24, 30, and 60fps. It can also record HDR video with Dolby Vision encoding and a 10-bit color depth. This is perhaps what lets it record HDR footage that looks just as good as its HDR photography. The phone\u2019s stabilization makes for surprisingly smooth handheld video, even when I tried to be (or failed to be anything but) fairly amateurish with my hand movements. That said, the image shifts rather quickly as lighting in the shot changes, and that can make for some jarring footage even if the motion is smooth. This issue is slightly diminished when shooting in 4K/30 instead of 4K/60. That brings us to another issue: settings. The iPhone 12 cameras behave differently depending on their settings. In testing I discovered that I could transition from the ultra-wide camera to the main camera and back in a single recording, but not if I was recording in 4K60. No settings indicated this would happen, and 4K60 still allows zooming in and out, but it restricts it to underwhelming digital zoom on the sensor you start the recording with. That said, the transition when the recording switches sensors is so jarring, it\u2019s best avoided altogether (that goes for the Galaxy S20, too). I also noticed switching from 4K to HD video recording actually crops the image slightly, but this isn\u2019t so much a concern as it is an oddity.  All told, the main iPhone 12 camera is among the best I\u2019ve used, especially when it comes to point-and-shoot. I\u2019d rank it above the Galaxy S20 because of that phone\u2019s struggle to get the right things in focus, but perhaps not as highly as the Sony Xperia V II. It takes great photos and videos with little fuss on my part. The ultra-wide \u2013 not so much. It\u2019s too bad there\u2019s only one great sensor, as the many Android phones offering multiple decent sensors wins out in versatility. Aside from actual visual issues, the biggest fault of the iPhone 12 camera is that it\u2019s so capable of doing all the heavy lifting that Apple has left out most user control. Anyone who wants the least bit of control over white balance, shutter speed, ISO, or anything else will find the iPhone 12 camera app lacking. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an app for that, but those controls in the default apps could have made it easier to capture pictures of my roommate\u2019s cat rolling around or record a video around my living room without the white balance shifting several times during the shot. Some of the settings that actually are user-adjustable, like toggling HDR, are sadly buried in the Settings app rather than appearing within the camera app itself.  Spinning around to the front, the selfie camera offers up clean and clear images. Next to the Galaxy S20 selfie camera, the iPhone easily offered a more realistic photo with better detail and less noise. Meanwhile, other features like slo-mo and portrait mode may be nice to have, but don\u2019t offer compelling quality.  The portrait mode feels like someone who\u2019s good at Photoshop was in a hurry, and I would have expected my bald head to be fairly easy to separate from a background. The slow-mo is capable, shooting at up to 240fps, but it gets dim and grainy.  Purchasing guide The iPhone 12 is available from Apple for $799 with carrier activation ($829 unlocked) for the 64GB model. We\u2019d recommend jumping up to the 128GB for an extra $50, as 64GB would get tight quickly. At $849 ($879 unlocked), the iPhone 12 may feel a bit lacking in features next to the competition. The price for the extra storage even puts it closer to the $999 iPhone 12 Pro , which does expand functionality a little by adding an extra camera, even if the screen and processor are the same. But, of the Pro models, the $1099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is the better choice. Every IGN iPhone Review 19 Images The Samsung Galaxy S20 may have started at $999 , but it\u2019s not hard to find Samsung phones at a discount, and the versatility of the S20 gives it an edge. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S20 FE offers an even more value at $699 . Unless you really want the extra screen space, the iPhone 12 Mini is the more enticing entry into the iPhone 12 era. It comes in $100 cheaper at $699 for the 64GB model, and the only difference is size: It\u2019s much smaller and features a 5.4-inch display."

        "Content": "Between now and 2001, the PlayStation is about to hit the biggest wave of franchise and sequel games it has ever seen. Not that there weren't already enough. Or that Sony ever hid its desire to approve the umpteenth Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, or Twisted Metal. But Trip Hawkins' 3DO isn't waiting around either. Army Men: Sarge's Heroes is the third of the series to hit the system in less than two years (with AM: 3D and AM: Air Attack preceding it), and Army Men World War already on its way. So the series continues. Where AM: 3D left off, Sarge's Heroes picks up the story and deals with some of the problems of the first, but also brings a whole new meaning to the word \"unfinished.\" At its core, Sarge's Heroes is a decent action title with some good ideas. But each one of them is buried in horrible control, unpolished game mechanics, and terrible graphics. Gameplay Sarge's Heroes actually has a hero, and a story, this time around. While Sarge was in the first PS game (AM: 3D) he's now a prominent personality, who figures much heavier into the game's humor and storyline via rendered movies and in-game cut-scenes. Trip Hawkins wanted Army Men to be 3DO's version of Mario, and so he needed a loveable platform character, and it looks like Sarge is it...or hopes to be it. Does Sarge deliver? In ideas, yes. In actuality, no. You play Sergeant Hawk (Sarge), who must fend off the overpowering and evil Tan army, commanded by General Plasto, who invades the Tan base, steals its five leading commandos, and threatens to take control of secret portals that lead to new worlds. Players must work their way through dozens of campaign levels, with a good variation of objectives, to find each commando, locate the blue spies, locate portals, but all to ultimately destroy the Tan army. As in every AM game, these army men pose in all of the classic poses, but this time around, a few new animations have been added. Among them, Sarge can jump and climb boxes, and can side step and strafe. New automatic targeting assists greatly in straight battles, as do a load of new weapons and gadgets, including a sniper rifle, binoculars, and the ability to drive tanks, which is a lot of fun. But when it comes to control, Army Men Sarge's Heroes may actually be worse than its predecessor. While the soldiers control with the same basic abilities, careful control and precise movement is utterly non-existent. I mean, the control sucks. If you find yourself attacked by a few Tan soldiers and you're up in a crate, there is no animation to back up off it. You can't do it. Instead, you must turn your back to the enemy, and walk of jump off. Nice strategy, Sarge. That's just one example. There are countless more. Laying down mines is another terrible experience. With the collision detection of a flea, each mine is basically worthless on its own. You must lay down about four to five mines just have a chance to blow up one tank. I just gave up after specifically trying to blow up tanks for about 45 minutes. It was a fruitless exercise.   Close up fights are worthless. Get up close to an enemy and you'll have a 50-50 chance of hitting him directly. Walk close to a 6-foot cliff and watch as you jump off into a shallow stream, and die. That's right. The water is instant cyanide. Kills you in a second. Like I said, the control is as good as the Titanic's turning radius, after it hit the iceberg. Enemy AI varies wildly, too. In some cases you can walk straight up to an enemy and shoot him in the face, and he either, A) won't die, or B) never saw you there, one foot in front of hid face. Likewise, you can approach some enemies from behind and they WILL notice you, while other times, you can plug them with several bullets from behind and they WON'T react at all. But the big tragedy here is that after I passed the first level -- and believe me, I didn't want to play this game -- I wanted to play more. The game ideas are fun and the game is compelling. The new sniper rifle is fun (but not surprisingly, any kind of precise control is crappy), driving tanks is a kick, and finding secret ammo areas was rewarding. I stayed up really late a few nights in a row intermittently loving and hating this game. But I ended up hating it more than loving it because the game doesn't reward you for gaining the necessary skills to play it. Instead, the errant sloppiness punishes you in every single level. The control problems carry over into multiplayer, too, so while the one-on-one play is potentially fun, you're not likely to play it that much, since the control beats you up as much or more than your opponent. Graphics Sarge's Heroes has more flair and color than AM: 3D. The palettes are more vibrant, thankfully, and have replaced the barren browns, beige, and dull greens of the first. The CG movies that follow each level are long and decently composed, and do add a good amount of interest to the characters. And the different terrain helps to keep the repetition down. I especially like the switch from Their World (the little plastic world of the Army Men themselves) to Our World (real living people's world, in which the Army Men look like the tiny little plastic toys they are). The conceptual difference is intriguing, and plays a big part in the attractiveness of the game. The first Army Men really needed more variation and this game delivers it. But overall, Sarge's Heroes doesn't look like a fifth year product. There is no pushing of the technological envelope in any way. It could easily get lost among the second to third wave games (from '97 or '98), which in some cases look way better than this. The Army Men themselves appear strangely fluid (like they're melting, and uninjured) when moving, which in itself isn't a problem, but they look like they're in the wrong game. Like test characters, contrasting sharply with their backgrounds, or like bad blue-screen movie scenes. The visual difference is very hard to ignore. Coupled with a good sampling of glitchy camera angles and dirty movie clips that often start and stop a few times, showing your character sitting there, and then the movie appearing, then the character, then the movie, shows that this game was either A) poorly tested, B) poorly programmed, C) Rushed (which can't be the case, because the game was delayed), or D) All the above. My choice is A, B, and C. Sound Sound...Hmmm...The game has it, and all of the characters display generally funny lines, but the music, just like the graphics, suffer from terrible production problems. When you reach a secret area, the music changes dynamically, filling you with rewarding, triumphant tunes. But the music does that every time you walk past a trigger point, So even after you have cleaned the area of weapons, the music still transitions from default to triumphant. That shouldn't happen after the first time. It's just sloppy. But at least Sarge's Heroes isn't packed with the same brutal taps themes that deflated the first one. It least the music is different, and didn't get in the way of the game."

        "Content": "Abzu creates one of the most relaxing, stress-free underwater experiences I\u2019ve ever played. By emphasizing freedom of movement over survival, it gave me all the time I needed to soak in its gorgeous art direction, marvel at its fluid controls, and listen to its epic orchestral score. During the course of this fascinating three-hour adventure full of deep-sea mysteries and discoveries, its moving melodies ebbed and flowed with my emotions and fueled my curiosity to reach the finale, even when the story lacked context. What you actually do along the way is a little light on gameplay, but it\u2019s still a spectacular journey worth taking.   Each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction and attention to detail. \u201c Abzu\u2019s intriguing underwater world is presented with little introduction \u2013 you\u2019re a mysterious diver who awakens and begins to explore \u2013 but it generates enough mystery to propel you through a series of stunning locations. From seaweed swaying in the current to mysterious sunken shrines, each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction, attention to detail, and an impressive sense of scale as you swim through enormous chasms under the sea.  This journey feels remarkable because of the way it constantly dangles the next intriguing area in front of you. I found myself traveling through its underwater rabbit hole into a strange, unfamiliar world full of cryptic iconography and ambient life such as fish, turtles, and whales. I was constantly wondering what I would find around the next bend, and each new area I discovered kept the surprises coming with fantastic architecture and some incredibly large spaces to swim in. And while nothing (including some intimidatingly large sharks) wants to actually eat you, it\u2019s still a fish-eat-fish world down here, and you can observe the convincingly recreated circle of life by meditating at a shark statue if you want.   Continuing on my journey I slowly waded into ancient ruins or completely lit-up, cathedral-like structures, and enjoyed the leisurely pace. In certain places it speeds up, and high-speed channels function like highways that pick up the pace and push you into beautiful new territory. One of the more memorable speedways had me swimming alongside a pod of incredibly large whales. It made me feel like a small fish in a very large pool.  Even during the most spectacular moments the framerate was almost always consistent at 30 per second despite the density of life on screen. I noticed it slow down slightly a handful of times, like when ultra dense schools of fish would swim in a tight loop.  The rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. \u201c Abzu\u2019s journey into the deep is conveyed primarily through pretty graphics, but its rousing, evocative musical score really steals the show. Each new area you explore is bookended by music from Journey composer Austin Wintory, and his contributions sound absolutely wonderful. The stirring ensemble of strings and flutes bounces back and forth between soothing tunes and rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. The orchestrations are carefully used to punctuate emotional moments in a way that I\u2019ve seen few games do, with the tempo rising and melting away into the background appropriately. And whenever the music dissipated, the ambient sounds of the sea served as a constant reminder that I was mostly alone in this world. It all makes Abzu the closest thing to a playable version of Disney\u2019s Fantasia that I\u2019ve seen produced by a video game.   But what are we actually doing here, other than taking in the sights and sounds? Abzu never makes that clear, either from a story perspective or with gameplay depth. I did enjoy my time swimming from the start because simple controls make is easy for almost anyone to pick up and enjoy moving around. Abzu uses a familiar control setup that resembles a driving game: holding the R2 button dives deeper and constantly moves you forward. You can boost to push through through areas quickly. Within minutes I could effortlessly maneuver in the water, do loop-the-loops, or break through to the surface and pull off a quick mid-air trick like a dolphin. And what limited interactions there are with the environment focus on helping you get around: you can grab onto fish when you want to move faster or slower.  Abzu's simple puzzle are designed to keep you moving ahead. \u201c It\u2019s just a little disappointing that Abzu\u2019s smooth movement isn\u2019t really put to the test by any form of challenge, like a race through the environment. You avoid a few hazards, but that\u2019s about it. Nasty underwater landmines are the only attacker you encounter, and outside of a worrisome warning bell when you get close their scary zaps are nothing more than a momentary hinderance. Abzu has some puzzles, too, but they\u2019re little more than quick flip switches that don\u2019t require a ton of thought. They\u2019re only meant to open up the next breathtaking location and keep pushing you forward.  The mystery Abzu presents at the start is intriguing, but the end of story is a little too abstract \u2013 even relative to other wordless storytelling adventures like Journey. There are a few cutscenes, but it mostly leans on environmental storytelling to fill in the gaps of what happened to an ancient, alien-looking civilization we find here. But what happened and why were very unclear, and on my first time through there wasn\u2019t enough context to give the ending the power it seemed to aim for. I couldn\u2019t quite place what Abzu wanted me to feel, so it just left me puzzled because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what had happened. But considering the entire thing is just three hours long, it\u2019s short enough that I didn\u2019t mind diving back in for another swim through to piece together the story, which revealed significantly more meaning now that I knew what to look for."

        "Content": "We bet you thought you quite liked ducks, with their harmless quacks and stupid feet. In fact, you've probably spent many a lazy sunny day, casually tossing husks of dried crust at their poor defenceless heads, in the spirit of arbitrary altruism. Put it this way though: if real ducks were anything like as mind-boggling annoying as their pixel counterparts in Super Rub'a'Dub , you'd be swapping your Hovis for a nail gun in no time.   In fact, as casual games go, Sony Europe has done a staggering job at creating one of the most pointless, soulless and - most importantly - infuriating titles we've seen in a while. This one's more likely to have your dear old mother hurling the PS3 through your fancy new 40-inch hi-def telly than it is encouraging a glassy-eyed state of catatonia after half a bottle of wine once Corrie's finished.  Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves though. In principle, Super Rub'a'Dub is quite an appealing idea. Simply, you're tasked with guiding a rubber duck around a bath-like maze in a quest to free your tiny plastic brethren from their bubble prisons and guide them to the plug hole exit. Of course, as usual, it's not quite that straightforward. As with Monkey Ball et al, rather than controlling the protagonist directly, tilting the SIXAXIS controller affects the lay of the water-logged level. Tilt right and water cascades in that direction, sending your tiny duck friends bobbing off accordingly. Further complicating matters are low walls threatening a plunge into oblivion, sharks with a penchant for nibbling on rubber flesh and other level-based obstacles requiring crafty navigation via controller-flicking jumps.   Success requires your completing a level within a set time limit. The goal is to hang onto each of your freed ducks (which form a polite line and follow your route) and dump the whole lot back at the exit together, forming a 'duck chain'. Depending on the number of ducks you liberate and the length of your chain, seconds will be subtracted from your overall time, earning you a medal in the process if you're swift enough.  As a starting point, it all works very well. Unfortunately, the first of Super Rub'a'Dub's many shortcomings is its complete failure to develop the idea in any particular direction. For pretty much the entire duration, you're faced with a range of extraordinarily basic 'mazes' to navigate, with obstacles limited to the odd chasm, badly placed shark or - very occasionally - a strong current or out-of-reach duck bubble. With a bit of creativity, these simple ingredients would be enough to fashion some increasingly fiendish skill-based levels to navigate. Unfortunately, what you get instead is level after tediously bland level, pretty much guaranteeing a flatline on the excite-o-meter after ten minutes. Even on 'Tough' mode, the only challenge arises from basic design flaws and sloppy controls.   Actually, now's probably a good time to address the issue of controls. Let's not forget that Super Rub'a'Dub is, essentially, the first game out of the Sony stable to rely exclusively on the PS3's motion-sensing capabilities. That being the case, you'd expect this to be a flagship title, demonstrating tight, responsive controls as a sign of things to come. Unfortunately, what you get - and yes, we realise this is entirely thanks to the inherent water-based gameplay - is a title which forces you to fight the completely unpredictable water physics in a manner which essentially feels like your duck is roller-skating drunkenly through syrup.   Presumably, in a bid to show off just how damn good the PS3 is at replicating real-life water, the developer failed to stop and think how this would affect the game itself. Consequently, even the simplest straight line manoeuvres require painfully minute adjustments to the SIXAXIS, lest an errant wave sloshes against a wall behind you, ricocheting up your arse and sending your duck and its troop catapulting over the side of the level. Similarly, things are all too unpredictable when it comes to navigating around enemies - one inevitable misstep and half your entourage is either eaten or jettisoned off into solitude. Unfortunately, given that success in a level is entirely dependent on bringing as many ducks to the exit as possible, you've got no choice but to restart after even the tiniest, unsalvageable mishap. It's hugely frustrating - and that's not even factoring in the dubious decision to map the 'jump' function to a jolt of the pad, rather than a button. Yup, unless you're holding the controller completely level, your ducky inevitably hurtles into space, taking your hard-earned flock with it.  With all this in mind, you can imagine we were hoping Super Rub'a'Dub's multiplayer option might be able to save proceedings from complete disaster. With support for up to four people, it's a bit of a disappointment to discover that you're expected simply to take it turns completing a single-player level as quickly as possible. Needless to say, enjoyment is limited to gleeful masochistic delight as your opponents grapple futilely with the controller and shout at the cat.   Admittedly, Super Rub'a'Dub does have some plus points. While simple, the visuals - particularly the water, with its constant shifting and rippling, bubbling and cascading - are nice. The generative soundtrack is subtly impressive too, randomly fading ambient samples in and out to embellish the base tunes. In fact, there's no avoiding that Super Rub'a'Dub feels more like a tech demo with a half-arsed game bolted on top - probably because that's exactly what it is."

Textures aren\u2019t nearly as detailed, clothing and hair look flat and solid, text is slightly blurry and without its crisp edges, and the overall image seems washed out, as if someone has slapped a desaturation filter over it. McCree\u2019s poncho looks like it\u2019s made from matte plastic rather than tailored cloth, and Winston\u2019s furry tufts resemble a Simpsons character more than an actual anthropomorphic ape. While looks aren\u2019t everything, the fact that distant enemies can often appear as a fuzzy silhouette can actually have an adverse effect on the way you play. Trying to snipe as Hanzo can be difficult when it feels like he\u2019s in need of a trip to the opticians. It\u2019s by no means a bad-looking game, though, and when played in handheld mode a lot of my qualms are reduced. Overwatch\u2019s strong art direction shines through and still makes it one of the best-looking games on the Switch outside of Nintendo\u2019s own games. Maps such as the sun-soaked Ilios and canal-laden Rialto pop off the small screen amid bursts of gunfire and all other means of weaponry. From a visual standpoint, playing handheld is the best way to enjoy Overwatch on Switch - but that is totally at odds with the best way from a control perspective. 647 Images The Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons \u2013 whether attached or in the Grip \u2013 just don\u2019t allow for the level of accuracy required for a high-speed shooter like Overwatch. Their analog sticks often feel stiff and can result in jerky movements when aiming, rather than smooth tracking while aiming down sights. Characters such as McCree and Ashe, in particular, are difficult to use as a result, with headshots becoming much more of a challenge to execute. Melee-based heroes such as Reinhardt or Brigitte are easier to use as they don\u2019t require anywhere near the same level of accuracy. It\u2019s terrible that a good number of heroes are a lot less fun to play though, and that leads to a level of roster imbalance not often associated with Overwatch. The Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons [...] just don't allow for the level of accuracy required for a high-speed shooter like Overwatch. \u201c Playing with a Pro Controller solves many of these issues \u2013 its ergonomic design feels much more natural for a shooter. Using a controller that works similarly to what I\u2019m used to on home console, every character on the roster feels a viable option again. But in a way that makes the issue worse, because the playing field is made so imbalanced in favor of people who\u2019ve paid for a $70/\u00a350 peripheral. It also presents a major contradiction: Overwatch plays best with the Pro Controller, but looks best when played handheld. That means there is no ideal way to play it on the Switch, unless you count pulling out the kickstand, placing it on the table and playing with a Pro Controller in your hand while leaning forward and squinting at the small screen. But who really wants to do that?  Watch Overwatch on Switch in action below : Perhaps the biggest addition accompanying Overwatch\u2019s move to the Switch is the incorporation of motion controls. When booting up for the first time, these gyroscopic tools are automatically turned on, which can be quite jarring at first. I brazenly tested them out to snipe with Widowmaker and quickly realised the error of my ways: they simply don\u2019t have the level of sensitivity needed to rely on them solely for aiming. As I waved my console around, my reticle roughly followed its path \u2013 before a Reaper appeared before my eyes and put a bullet between them. After several attempts I began to hit a sweet spot: using the right stick to aim before using the motion controls to fine-tune my aim slightly produced better results, but still didn\u2019t find it particularly satisfying. It just feels nowhere near as responsive or smooth as micro-adjusting Link\u2019s bow in Breath of the Wild does. I tested motion controls out with a few more characters before turning them off altogether, deciding that at best they\u2019re a novelty, and at worst a hindrance. It just feels nowhere near as responsive or smooth as micro-adjusting Link\u2019s bow in Breath of the Wild does. \u201c On the more positive side, Overwatch on the Switch does come with its own native voice chat, a big plus when considering the majority of games require a separate app to do the same thing. It works effectively as well - turning it on is  as simple as plugging a compatible headset into the Switch\u2019s headphone port, just like in Fortnite. There are a number of other technical issues that trip up the minute-to-minute enjoyment, though. Frame rate is capped at 30fps, which instantly feels at odds with the fluid nature of Overwatch as it exists on all other platforms. Worse, it\u2019s not locked at 30 and it dips below even that when a lot is taking place on screen, which is a frequent circumstance in this game. A Zenyatta Transcendence coupled with a D.Va self-destruct and a Lucio Sound Barrier thrown into the mix can lead to some serious slowdown \u2013 a particular issue when you take into account that these Ultimate abilities are designed to be used in tandem. On top of that, character models often take a few seconds to load in when spawning or changing hero, and Play of the Game highlights can sometimes appear with invisible characters. (And, crucially, there is no save-clip option on these highlights, and even the Switch\u2019s native capture function is disabled.) It\u2019s a baffling exclusion for a game centred around exciting moments, particularly for someone like me who isn\u2019t afraid to share a highlight or two on social media.  Watch the trailer for this year's Halloween Event below : Like other versions of Overwatch, you also need to have an internet connection to get into a game, which makes playing while you\u2019re out and about a virtual impossibility. This was to be expected, but it would have been nice to see at least the training modes available while offline for the sake of portability. They\u2019re not. Even when it\u2019s not at its best, Overwatch is still fundamentally fun and the best shooter on Switch. \u201c And yet, despite all of these technical issues being noticeable, they\u2019re almost never game-breaking, and during the heat of a thrilling point capture or overtime scramble never entirely killed the fun. Even when it\u2019s not at its best, Overwatch is still fundamentally fun and the best shooter on Switch. Very few other games anywhere offer the same level of excitement on a game-to-game basis as this."

        "Score": 4.4,
        "id": "aa02790f79a63146bb623fcf525bd9d7",
        "Content": "Is it any surprise, really, that the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles title is a giant pile of terrapin faeces? It shouldn't be - this is a licensed game based loosely around an upcoming all-ages film. Of course, when Ubisoft Montreal announced it was handling the licence, we perked up our ears. Could it be? A truly cool TNMT game - on a next-gen system, no less? And from a talented, proven developer? Sadly, this just isn't the case.  As much as it pains us to admit, as lingering fans of the almost 20-year-old series, TNMT fails on just about every level. It lacks structure, it is inexplicably ugly and poorly designed, the sounds range from screeching and buggy to broken, the gameplay is demented and the lack of co-operative play is absolutely unforgivable and damning.  It didn't have to be this way. The gameplay combines elements of another Ubisoft action-platformer - the Prince of Persia series. Like the iconic Prince, the Turtles can race along walls, ninja-style, swing from poles and rafters, double-jump, wall-jump, climb and hang from precipices. A good fit on the surface, but unlike the Persian adventures the controls are not nearly as solid, responsive or, importantly, reliable.  The default character running speed is cumbersomely slow at times, and often your turtle of choice will automatically decide that, no, he doesn't particularly want to run, so he'll start walking instead. It's uncanny. You can be 'sprinting' along and suddenly, he'll just start walking . Why?  Leaping from surface to surface works about 80 per cent of the time. However, the jump movement is much more of a vertical motion than it is a distance-crossing one. It makes avoiding trip-wires and lasers more of a hassle than it should be. The distance-leaping issue is sidestepped by taking advantage of the other mildly successful concept that TNMT runs with - the idea of a brotherly helping hand. You can tag-team at any point with another turtle - Donny, Raph, Mikey, or Leo - for either a powerful super attack when in combat, or a strange, swirling grapple that flings you across chasms. This works fairly well in practice - just double-jump towards your intended landing spot, and at the crest of the jump, tap X. Another turtle will materialise and fling you a little farther.   The tag-team grapple move is pretty nifty. Too bad it's lost in a overgrown jungle of poor gameplay.  The 'story' mode, which is essentially a disjointed 16 or so levels of repetitive, rudimentary platforming, is broken up by either inexplicably choppy snippets of film footage or comic book-style panels that are panned across. It's a strange tale too, involving not just the traditional four turtles, Splinter, The Foot and others, but the turtles' alter-egos - pointlessly armoured or veiled solo avengers, who traverse the city alone in search of wrong-doers.  Combat is a bit of a joke. After progressing every few hundred in-game metres, you'll enter an area where enemies will suddenly spawn all around you, and they must be defeated to progress past the invisible walls cordoning off your path. It's a very odd way to handle the action component of the game - it feels unnatural for these breakaway moments of combat to be interspersed with rooftop leaps of faith. It's silly, amateurish design.  B is your primary attack button, delivering hands-based attacks with whatever your turtle's default weapon is. Repeated taps of B are all it takes to unleash a continuous, flowing combo of blows that are enough to take out the mindless swarms of Foot soldiers and street thugs. Sure, you can mix things out with a kick or two with Y, but why bother? It's slow, ineffective and unnecessary, thanks to several other game-destroyingly powerful techniques. Holding down B charges up a special linked-attack, where your character will automatically target the nearest four enemies and slash or smack them for an automatic kill. As if the other auto-combo method wasn't easy enough, this one clears the area around you pretty efficiently, allowing you to ready your charge-up for the next incoming wave. Ugh.  The enemy AI is limited to say the least. They can attack or defend and walk towards you. That's about the extent of their skills. Boss battles fare a little better, but later encounters, such as an oversized-hammer-wielding monster in a circular arena feel cheap and tacky.   The cheap, tacky feel extends to the presentation. We'd like to believe that the character models, recycled, cel-shaded and turned into flat images during cutscenes, are purposely, stylistically appallingly low in polygonal detail. Or that the environment, which is equally blocky, sparse and crummy, was done in such a way for some higher artistic gain - a gain that has heretofore eluded us. The game tries to pass it off as a stylistic choice. Tries .  But the reality is, this is practically a retextured port of the Xbox or PS2 release, given a fresh pair of slacks, a widescreen smile and shoved out the door into an unforgiving and informed market. The engine, which has some very rough bump-mapping effects poorly plastered over many surfaces, frequently slows down. There are even some areas that aren't rendered properly - areas that are displayed only after you plummet over a ledge to your death, revealing a sea of untextured, unmodelled blue.  Let us assure you, the 360 should be able to push this game out without raising its heart rate, let alone break a sweat. This isn't in the realm of Gears of War. In fact, this isn't even in Kameo's, or that of any other launch title. It is arguably the most unspectacular looking next-gen game available. Lego Star Wars II showed how style and simplicity could co-exist with more graphically demanding games, even on the 360. But TMNT is something else altogether. It's a sheep in tarted-up wolf's clothing. If the wolf worked the streets, didn't get a lot of sleep and did a lot of drugs during its down-time.   Heroes in a mashed-shell. TURTLE POWER!  Then there is the sound, which is equal parts irritating and glitchy. Whoever the master linguist was who penned Mikey's line, \"Awesomely-super-sensationalistic, dude!\", that person is clearly out of synch with the rest of society. This line, and a dozen of a similar calibre are repeated over and over, each time you make it past tricky jumps or complex platforming. Often, enemies and other characters will repeat their lines over the top of their last line of dialogue, creating an unintentionally amusing 'in-the-round' effect. Well, it's amusing until the fifth or sixth layer of sound is added and the dialogue descends into unintelligible gibberish - or more so, anyway.  There is no logical reason for not implementing four player cooperative play. The swap-in, tag-team system could easily be swapped out for multiplayer games. Our best guess is that this game was absolutely pushed through development in order to make it to shelves before the film's release. As a result, it is a mish-mash of badly balanced gameplay, faulty presentation and pointless unlockable content. It's the sort of game that reviewers have been trashing since the birth of the gaming industry - the latest in a string of poorly-implemented kids fodder that fails to be fun.  "

        "Content": "Fortnite must be going through its third awakening right now. I haven\u2019t played a single round of Battle Royale for weeks, and that\u2019s mainly because I can no longer make it past the starting menu without running face-first into a flurry of full-sized  spin-offs framed as new game modes. Fortnite Rocket Racing, an arcade racer that mixes ideas from both Rocket League and Fortnite, is one of them \u2013 and while it\u2019s very much in its infancy, this barebones first draft is fun enough to call it the beginning of what could become a great standalone racing game one day. But, even with 26 decently-designed maps, seamless integration into Fortnite\u2019s broader progression systems, and easy-to-setup cross-platform multiplayer for up to 12 players, Rocket Racing struggles to stay fresh after you\u2019ve seen through the cracks of its simplistic car handling and questionable multiplayer balance. Even with a great idea at the center of its circuit, it\u2019s difficult to declare this a Victory Royale. Don\u2019t let the Rocket League tie-in confuse you; Rocket Racing only shares its association with the previous game developed by Psyonix in that it also features toy cars doing physics-defying stunts. Instead, Rocket Racing tastefully borrows inspiration from games like Distance , Rollcage , Wipeout , and GRIP: Combat Racing . There are 12 cars on the map, each trying to reach the finish line first \u2013 pretty standard stuff, but Rocket Racing\u2019s twist on that formula is that drifting fills up your boost meter similar to Mario Kart , allowing you to zoom past the competition after gaining enough momentum. There are no items or weapons on the map like you\u2019d find in similar combat racers; instead, your sole focus is on maintaining your max speed while selectively drifting, boosting, and generally avoiding other players or obstacles that would slow you down. Fortnite Rocket Racing Gameplay Screenshots 70 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask This is a strong concept on its own, only made better by the added layer of depth jumping and flying introduces. You can tap a button to shoot your car into the air, and holding that same button down makes you fly (at the cost of your vehicle\u2019s speed). Likewise, you can use your car\u2019s jump and flight controls to quickly navigate out of the path of an obstacle by clinging to a wall or ceiling \u2013 kind of like in Distance. Keeping things interesting, it\u2019s great that each map presents different obstacles and alternate pathways that force you to choose your approach carefully, since you can easily miss speed boosts placed on the track or drift into a hazard, causing you to explode and respawn somewhere behind the rest of the pack. Speed boosting is the name of the game, and there are several ways you can quickly boost ahead of the crowd\u2026 at least in theory. All this boosting and thrusting feels and sounds good in action, but there are a few esoteric systems under the hood which don\u2019t always feel transparent or fair \u2013 and that\u2019s where Rocket Racing\u2019s problems begin to appear. For instance, hitting the gas on the green light at the beginning of each match can give you up to 100% extra speed depending on your exact timing\u2026 but even when I timed it just right, it felt like I was consistently only landing 35-40% boosts. Its quick races can sit comfortably in moments between other activities. \u201c It\u2019s nice that if you get too far behind, Rocket Racing goes out of its way to help you catch up with everyone else near the rear without putting in much effort. But even when I\u2019m clearly ahead of everyone else, it seems like my drifting and tight steering don\u2019t go quite as far to keep me ahead. Other players will miraculously appear out of nowhere, taking the lead just in time to steal my first place spot before I reach the finish line. It\u2019s understandable that there are protections in place to keep matches more interesting to the very end \u2013 especially considering the vast performance chasms Fortnite attempts to cover in its cross-platform matchmaking \u2013 but when Rocket Racing punishes you for doing well, it can speedily suck the fun out of playing competitively. As with basically every other Fortnite game, there isn\u2019t much story or setup to worry about. You just tap a button to begin matchmaking, and soon you\u2019ll be off. To its benefit, Rocket Racing is one of those enjoyable casual games that sits comfortably in moments between other activities, seeing as how each match only lasts for three laps \u2013 or about three minutes. You\u2019re definitely not committing to a 15 or 20 minute multiplayer match ala Fortnite Battle Royale (you can probably finish four or five races in that same time), and being tied into Fortnite\u2019s popularity means you\u2019ll rarely find yourself without a buddy to play against. What do you think about Epic releasing full new games within Fortnite? It's weird, I wish they were standalone I already played Fortnite so it's fine by me I downloaded Fortnite just to try one (or more) of them I don't care either way Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results Unfortunately it\u2019s seemingly not possible to play against another player locally, at least on the Xbox Series X, which is a bit of a drag since that feels like a staple of casual racers. It\u2019s at least fairly easy to get around that  since Fortnite is free-to-play, so I\u2019ve already installed it on every platform I own. I\u2019m also impressed at how well its performance scales between the Nintendo Switch and PC, where I could compete against other players at roughly the same level of competence no matter which hardware I was using. I didn\u2019t feel as bad when I partied up with a group of friends across platforms as I might playing Battle Royale, no matter which system I or they were playing on. Aside from a few network issues on my provider\u2019s end \u2013 which were present on every system I tested Rocket Racing on, over the course of an entire weekend \u2013 it\u2019s a smooth and tight experience no matter how beefy your gaming machine. I\u2019ve always been impressed by the wizardry behind Fortnite\u2019s multiplayer systems, allowing over a hundred players to coexist in the same map at once during Battle Royale matches, regardless of hardware. The chaos and high-speed action of Rocket Racing makes me appreciate that aforementioned wizardry even more, seeing as how hard it must be to keep everyone on even footing with this much stuff happening in this tight of a space. The main problem is that there\u2019s just not much to Rocket Racing right now. \u201c The main problem with Rocket Racing is that there\u2019s just not much to it right now. Even though it has 26 maps, most of them rarely make it into circulation, which leaves the impression that there is significantly less stuff to see. Softening that blow, Fortnite still lets you scroll down a list and select one map to play at a time \u2013 and this is especially useful if you\u2019re sick of the popular rotation \u2013 but its current way of facilitating that choice isn\u2019t all that convenient. The amount of time needed to find a match slows down dramatically if you have to manually select a specific map from the list every time instead of opting for general matchmaking, and it\u2019s not like you can pick and choose a bunch of maps to plot out your own custom playlist. At least those maps \u2013 even the ones on repeat \u2013 are well-designed and enjoyable to replay. For instance, Bone Cavern features a series of tunnels filled with obstacles that encourage tricky use of flying and wall-riding, and it can be a lot of fun to watch other players miss their jump and crash head-first into a hazard. Moments like this are so hectic, I\u2019m instantly reminded of games like Mario Party or Fall Guys. Car customization, on the other hand, is a total non-starter. Each of these unremarkable toy cars handles the same, and there\u2019s absolutely no variation in performance to speak of \u2013 even if you do unlock different visual car designs. It\u2019s genuinely unclear how to unlock new vehicles and cosmetics anyway, other than by earning the scant few cars available on the higher tiers of the Fortnite Battle Pass. I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll eventually need to pay V-Bucks for the privilege of owning different and better-looking rides, but until then, it\u2019s boring to stare at the same cars over and over again. I\u2019m ultimately left conflicted on whether I enjoy Rocket Racing\u2019s integration into Fortnite\u2019s progression and Battle Pass system. On the one hand, it\u2019s nice that the levels I\u2019m earning in Rocket Racing are contributing to my level in Battle Royale and vice versa; especially since the cars I do eventually earn can be used as vehicle skins in the Battle Royale mode. But on the other hand, it feels like most of my leveling to earn those cars will be done in other modes once I get bored with Rocket Racing \u2013 and after that happens, it\u2019ll just fade back into being a minigame that I ignore in favor of everything else in Fortnite\u2019s expanding armada of stuff."

The Ultravoid is an utterly surreal place - beautiful, colourful, yet also broken, desolate.

Above me, a monstrous-looking creature known as a Remnant patrols the sky, and it\u2019s so large I\u2019ll literally skate along its back when I confront and kill it; part of a desperate bid to save my home planet from becoming the latest victim of The Ultravoid\u2019s insatiable appetite.

Rei contemplates the Ultravoid before leaping in. Rei Crisis Solar Ash\u2019s vivid colour palette is evocative of developer Heart Machine\u2019s last game, Hyper Light Drifter , but transposed to a 3D open-world, in which momentum is the overriding design principle.

These are necessary to power a gigantic, monolithic piece of technology called the Starseed - which, in turn, is the only hope to close the black hole itself and save Rei\u2019s planet from imminent destruction. This broad story set-up translates to reaching and clearing out anomalies that are interfering with the conduits, then defeating each area\u2019s colossal boss creature. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Action-platforming is very much the main driver of Solar Ash, but it\u2019s interested in worldbuilding too, and has plenty to dig into via story elements like audio logs left by Rei\u2019s missing teammates, scrawled notes in the environment, a handful of survivors you can talk to, and quizzing Rei\u2019s friendly AI construct Cyd on the details of the mission. This all helps make the overarching plot more impactful as it gradually comes into clarity, leading to a climax that\u2019s punchier than I was expecting; a neat twist for a game that\u2019s so kinetic in focus most of the time. This kineticism is expressed through wide open environments and platforming challenges that allow Rei to almost always be in motion. You\u2019re able to scan each area for key objectives, while telltale icons on surfaces reveal if a hidden audio log is nearby. The fun here is in working out how to reach objectives, not wondering where they are, so I always felt like I was navigating the world with purpose. Rei has a slight yet powerful set of abilities, crafted specifically for open-world platforming. She smoothly transitions between running and skating, with an incredible feeling - and sounding - boost ideal for zooming past enemies, hitting a lip at top speed, or just catapulting forward from a standing start. I appreciated having to wrangle Rei\u2019s inertia in order to bring her to a sudden stop from full pelt, but the joy of movement was occasionally stymied by quirks like inexplicably going the wrong way on a rail, missing grinds entirely, or falling off a platform thanks to an unhelpful camera. This is a world full of swooping rails, of floating platforms, of localised gravity, and of simple but satisfying movement puzzles. \u201c But for the most part the skating feels great between those hiccups, whether you\u2019re boosting then double jumping to skip across the surface of treacherous acid lakes, leapfrogging through a series of grapple points in the air, directing then riding mushroom rails, or ascending a bulbous column of clouds in order to reach an ancient structure high in the sky. This is a world full of swooping rails, of floating platforms, of localised gravity, and of simple but satisfying movement puzzles. Sideshow Melee While there are enemies to fight, encounters with them are streamlined. Rei can time slip to slow down time then grapple in, instantly dispatching smaller foes with a slash or two. When this works it adds nicely to Solar Ash\u2019s flow, and Rei can pull off some pretty sweet moves like grappling to an enemy in the air, and killing it before leaping to a climbable surface. When it doesn\u2019t, however, Rei can feel a little clumsy. She\u2019s very good at closing the gap, for instance, but not so great at handling multiple enemies, and it can be difficult to avoid taking damage in some situations. These enemies really are a sideshow, however - obstacles to avoid or defeat en route to the main objectives: the anomalies. These are areas of volatile black goo (as opposed to the  inert, climbable black goo throughout levels) and each is treated like a movement puzzle. Slashing at the exposed nerve ending (represented by a protruding spike) reveals an energy trail through the gunk and bone to another point, and potentially several more, each of which must be slashed before the anomaly overheats and fries anything on it. In a stylish touch, Rei is always able to grapple to the final point to stab its energy core and clear the anomaly. Each of these mini-challenges is unique but the quickly familiar structure of them means only some actually stand out. The best anomalies deliver on Solar Ash\u2019s movement-focused foundation to make Rei feel like a bad-ass, but just as in combat, others can leave her feeling a bit like she has two left feet. If you could somehow venture inside a black hole, what would you expect to find? A mirror world, most likely with an evil version of myself A mirror world, most likely with a good version of myself All my lost socks Copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial for Atari 2600 I'll tell you in the comments Answer See Results Defeating the huge titans that Rei grapples aboard also follows a similar structure of moving from node to node, but are entirely built around skating and grappling, which helps make them feel faster-paced and more streamlined than some of the anomalies. Each Remnant is beaten in stages - usually the same run of hitting nerve endings three times over, but with added steps or less safe areas to skate on each time. These encounters are a frantic dash against the clock, and the sight of riding along the back of a flying, otherworldly creature or dashing up the arm of a lumbering behemoth before grappling across to another part of its body is certainly impressive. That said, they also expose some of the weaker elements of Solar Ash\u2019s gameplay - chiefly, it can be difficult to judge your position and momentum while atop a moving creature, particularly as the camera shifts around. Like Shadow of the Colossus... only with more inline skating. Generally it\u2019s not such a problem for the first two stages of each Remnant challenge, but I found the third and final sequence - where there\u2019s less room for error - a little frustrating for several of the beasts, particularly as a single slip-up can mean a third stage restart. Heart Machine has definitely leaned into the ability to slow time and grapple during these encounters, which helps make the controls feel more precise without losing the energy and the spectacle, but overall I was typically more relieved than elated when I beat these bosses. In general, in fact, it\u2019s actually the journey - as opposed to the destination - that I got the most out of from Solar Ash\u2019s gameplay, and that\u2019s probably because this is when you\u2019re most in the world, enjoying its striking aesthetic and the differences between biomes. The Mirrorsea area, for instance, mixes up vertiginous rails and floating space debris with acid pools and ancient ruins. Eternal Garden, on the other hand, is completely different to explore, cleverly using the native fungi for movement puzzles and shifting the mood as Rei ventures into pitch dark caverns. Solar Ash Review Screenshots 19 Images It\u2019s absolutely worth chasing the collectables in Solar Ash as well, as finding all the Voidrunner stashes in an area unlocks a new suit for Rei to wear that typically offers a genuinely useful new buff. These include doubling your attack power, drastically reducing your boost cooldown, the ability to scan for remaining stashes, and more. It would have been nice if these weren\u2019t either/or choices, however - I\u2019d have loved to be able to equip at least a couple of these bonuses at once. There\u2019s also the fact that by the time I\u2019d actually collected all the suits, well, I had very little left to do in the world."

        "Content": "An intriguing sci-fi setting with an amnesiac hero. Distinctively rotoscoped visuals. Innovative gameplay mechanics and a difficulty level that rewarded patience and pinpoint accuracy. These are just a few of the reasons why Delphine Software\u2019s original 1992 Flashback was lauded by many as one of the great action games of the 16-bit generation. Unfortunately this HD remake doesn\u2019t come close to earning such accolades. Helmed by original director Paul Cuisset, the plot, settings and characters in Flashback remain mostly unchanged, but those other descriptors no longer apply. The hand-traced art has been ditched in favour of a more generic 2.5D, Unreal Engine-powered aesthetic, the gameplay is straightforward and lacking in surprises, and any sense of challenge has been neutered thanks to the addition of a generous healthbar and frequent checkpointing. Flashback 2013 is a respectable platform shooter in an affordable package, but it fails to reach the same heights as when it first arrived amidst the era of gulf wars and grunge music. The remake opens in the exact same fashion as the original, with protagonist Conrad B. Hart fleeing an alien base on the planet Titan only to have his jetbike cop a targeted laser blast and crash-land into a mutant-infested jungle region. From there Flashback follows the same narrative trajectory as before, taking you from amnesiac agent to spaceport errandboy, life-or-death game show contestant, wanted man on the run and eventual holder of the fate of the human race. It\u2019s an enjoyable story that draws inspiration from the likes of Total Recall and The Running Man, and although it mostly follows the same beats as the original there\u2019s a couple of new plot twists along the way that may surprise Flashback veterans, even if the ultimate outcome is the same. The exposition is better realised this time around thanks to extended cutscenes with full voice acting, as opposed to the text-based character interactions and silent cinematics from before. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword - it enables more detailed characterization as well as some funny additional lines (when threatened at gunpoint one character states, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019ve got two virtual kids!\u201d), but unfortunately it also paints the previously mysterious Conrad as more of an insufferable douchebag with the habit of spouting catchphrases like \u201cTime to party!\u201d and \u201cAwesome-sauce!\u201d I very much prefered him as the strong, silent type to be honest. A more welcome change is Conrad\u2019s ability to fire in a full 360-degree arc using the right thumbstick, as opposed to only being able to fire on a horizontal plane like before. This contemporary control tweak allows each level to throw more mobile enemies at you, such as the airborne drones that swarm overhead, as well as vary the method for unlocking certain doors by requiring you to shoot at otherwise out of reach switches. Conrad is much easier to control in his general movement too, and you\u2019re granted a lot more leniency if you slightly misstime a leap, since he\u2019ll automatically grab onto the edge of ledges. So there\u2019s no need to painstakingly measure out each jump like you had to before, and consequently level traversal is a much more fluid process than it once was. \"Wheee! This is sweeter than a jar of awesome-sauce, you guys!\" Conrad also has a handful of new tricks up his sleeve, namely a charged-up secondary fire for his pistol (for blasting through walls), the ability to shoot while running or dangling from ledges, and stealthy takedown moves for killing enemies quickly and quietly (which you\u2019ll rarely ever need to use, to be fair). Curiously the then-innovative ability to throw stones in order to distract guards has been removed, as have the mouse-bombs, and it\u2019s shame that the developers haven\u2019t introduced any new gadgets in their place. But happily Conrad still gets his hands on the invaluable force field gadget as well as the excellent teleport device later on. There is also the addition of frag grenades, but they\u2019re seldom required since generally speaking - and despite Conrad\u2019s added abilities - every enemy in Flashback can be overcome by dive-rolling from side to side and using the force field to block their shots while you return fire. This was largely the case in the original too, but that was 20 years ago, and at this point combat feels noticeably repetitive and overly simplistic. It never really requires you to modify your strategy, even in the later stages against supposedly tougher foes. This strict adherence to the basic AI patterns of the original game contrasts with a far more precise targeting setup and Conrad\u2019s more resilient physique, resulting in an experience that can be breezed through on all but the hardest difficulty level in a few hours of play. It would have been great if they\u2019d included an enemy type that, say, forced you to use the teleporter in order to defeat them, or an environmental puzzle with a solution more complex than activating the new molecular glasses and shooting at the nearest glowing green thing. But for the most part that\u2019s simply not the case. On the handful of occasions that the designers attempt to shake things up and surprise fans of the original, Flashback 2013 falls flat. Take the playable jetbike sequence that hurtles you from Earth\u2019s city streets to the Paradise strip club (replacing the simple taxi ride in the original). Aesthetically it resembles a sidescrolling WipEout race, complete with speed boosts, and it should be a lot of fun in principle. In practice, it feels more akin to a sloppy interpretation of Jetpack Joyride and comes across merely as filler intended to drag out Flashback\u2019s fairly modest running time. Sadly not even remotely as fun as it looks. Later, the boss fight against a giant alien brain still manages to feel decidedly anti-climactic despite being far larger in scale than its counterpart in the original game, again due to the general lack of thought needed in order to overcome it. For a fight against an enormous brain, the encounter is disappointingly mindless. There are a couple of substantial bonuses included with this remake, in the form of a suite of brand new VR challenges - accessed via designated stations found throughout the main game - as well as the full version of the original game which can be selected from the main menu. The former serves as both a tutorial hub for Conrad\u2019s new moves as well as a way to earn extra XP to level up his weapon and health attributes (though sadly not in any meaningful ways), by taking on different waves of enemy types within closed off arenas. These VR rooms offer up a stiffer challenge than the encounters found in the main game if only because they\u2019re done against the clock. The second bonus - the original Flashback in all its rotoscoped glory - can be accessed from the main game menu. Even now it oozes a moody atmosphere, and it provides a much stiffer challenge than that of the remake. If you\u2019re a newcomer (or your advancing age has eroded the patience you once had in 1992), the added option to save anywhere counterbalances the more unforgiving enemies and lack of checkpoints. Playing through the original game immediately after finishing the remake, it struck me how much more satisfying the simple act of firing Conrad\u2019s gun was thanks to the superb rotoscoped recoil animation and muzzle flare. It\u2019s honestly as impactful now as it was two decades ago. It\u2019s just a shame that in all facets, the HD remake never hits with the same kind of force."

        "Content": "If there's one console that I'm more emotionally attached to than any other, it's my SEGA Genesis. The minute I got my Genesis at a garage sale, my other systems started collecting dust. And if there was one game I played more than any other, it was Sonic the Hedgehog. Seeing what's become of the Sonic franchise is kind of like running into an old high school friend only to discover he dropped out of Harvard despite having a full scholarship, scared off his one true love with his jealous rantings, and became a heroin fiend more pitiable than likeable. Yes, it's like running into Dave Clayman in the IGN parking garage.  I'm going to do you a great favor and save you some time and money. Don't buy Sonic Unleashed . There, you can stop reading and spend your $60 on something more worthwhile. Like 60 tacos. But if you really just have to know more about the train wreck that is Sonic Unleashed, then I suppose we must go on.  Sonic Unleashed is divided rather evenly into three parts: Daytime, nighttime, and adventure. Think of Sonic Unleashed like a mixed drink. The daytime levels are like good vodka. On its own, a refreshing beverage. Add Kahlua and milk and you have the Dude's favorite drink. The nighttime and adventure sections, however, are no Kahlua and milk. It's more like adding dirt and soy sauce. Even with a lemon twist, that's just not a drink anyone is going to order.  The daytime levels are fast-paced on-rails sections focused on speed. This is what a new generation Sonic should be like. Oh, it's not perfect, but it's the building block for the future of the franchise. The daytime levels with Sonic have only the rarest of framerate drops and are consistently enjoyable. You can actually go so fast that it's hard to comprehend what's even happening before you slam into a wall of spikes, but I can live with the trial-and-error aspects of this design. The biggest issue with the daytime levels is that the jump button is not as responsive as it should be. With a game moving this quickly, you need to have jumps initiate the moment you put pressure on the button. But Sonic is often so slow to jump, you have to go a second earlier than you would normally.   It's in the daytime where Sonic Unleashed unloads all its creative juices. There are some really fun sequences across the various levels. You'll run on top of whales, slide down the spines of dragons and bobsled through icy canyons. Sure, there are going to be a few moments that require such precise movements that you may get temporarily frustrated, but still the daytime sections are the best Sonic has been in many years.  Unfortunately, that's just one third of the game. The other two-thirds are absolute and complete abominations -- the kind of gaming most often made by two half-drunk 40-somethings from a former Soviet bloc country and found in a PC bargain bin.  By day, Sonic is all about speed (and some light platforming elements). By night, the speed is sucked away and Sonic becomes nothing but a mindless brawler. The Werehog is forced to smack around the same repetitive cadre of villains across levels that last upwards of 30 torturous minutes. Mixed into this are numerous bad platforming sections. Here's a tip. If you are going to have platforming in a game where one missed jump means instant death, then make sure you put some sort of proper shadowing that indicates where your character is going to land. That's platforming 101. You have to know where the hell your airborne character is in relation to ground.   Adding to the muddled nighttime design is the bizarre power the Werehog has gained. He can stretch his arms like Mr. Fantastic. Why? Great question. It doesn't really matter the answer (there isn't any that wouldn't encourage your brain to separate from your skull). All that matters is that it's a dumb gimmick that more or less throws egg on the face of longtime Sonic fans.  The nighttime sections are poorly designed, boring and frustrating. But worst of all, they have nothing to do with Sonic whatsoever. Nothing. If you saw a demo of the Werehog without knowing the name of the game, I doubt you'd guess it was actually Sonic the Hedgehog trapped in this misery. I can understand that it's just not feasible to create a 6-8 hour on-rails Sonic experience with him moving at the speed of sound, but that doesn't excuse this dreck being slapped on. The werehog is one of the worst times I've had with any game this year. Wasn't it around the time Old Yeller turned into a werehog that someone had to finally put him out of his misery?  The last third of the puzzle are the adventure sections. These are perhaps the most disappointing, since they often keep you from actually playing the core game. In each of the different continents (which you are trying to glue back together after Dr. Robotnik split them apart) you'll wander the streets talking to citizens for no good reason other than to bolster the amount of hours played. You must search these areas for hidden tokens, used to unlock the day and night stages. There's nothing of value in these sections. It's just a time waster. And waste time it will as this really does eat up a good chunk of gameplay.   I suppose it's not fair to blame all of the problems with the other two-thirds of Sonic Unleashed on Sonic Team . After all, it's Dr. Robotnik who irradiated the hedgehog transforming him into a shape-shifting nightmare. What could Sonic Team do but follow up on Dr. Robotnik's actions? It's not like they control the game's story or anything. Yeah, let's blame Dr. Robotnik. Boooo. "

        "Content": "Every year a new Madden NFL game comes out, and every year the marginal improvements and new additions feel like just enough to keep the series moving forward. This year, however, things feel a bit different in Madden NFL 21. Despite the introduction of the surprisingly fun and unique The Yard mode, the list of persistent issues, neglected features, and new annoyances is growing quite long. So even though the underlying moment-to-moment football gameplay has continued to make progress with its fine-tuning refinements, just about everything else is underwhelming -- including technical performance. It\u2019s easy to be dismissive of annual sports games by saying they look and play the same every year because, to some degree, that\u2019s true. Changes have been noticeable but minor ever since the series moved to the Frostbite engine in 2017, so everything has stayed relatively consistent, for better and for worse. As usual, when you\u2019re playing a game from the typical zoomed-out camera perspective, Madden 21 looks fantastic. Stadiums are true-to-life, character models are extremely detailed, animations look smooth and responsive, and overall it\u2019s got a sharp design that feels cutting-edge and primed to make the free upgrade to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X later this year. Once you get up close, though, player faces are often stiff and awkward and the fans in the bleachers still look like low-poly cardboard cutouts. EA has repeatedly missed opportunities to graphically polish these areas that could really use it. Madden NFL 21 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S Updated December 11, 2020 You\u2019d be forgiven if, outside of the minor graphical upgrade, you can\u2019t tell the difference between the Xbox One/PlayStation 4 versions and the Xbox Series X |S/ PlayStation 5 versions of Madden NFL 21. Some of the marketed improvements, like overall animation quality, more realistic sideline character interactions, and higher quality fans are hard to spot at a glance or seemingly non-existent. The only noticeable changes in gameplay are mostly under the hood to funnel in more accurate stat tracking, animation cycles, and a better play-calling interface. Specifically, you can now select plays based on key players instead of sifting through the entire playbook, and key plays will automatically trigger fancy \u201cNext-Gen Stats\u201d replays that dish out fun facts like how fast the receiver was running or how many yards after the catch they racked up. Other than that, there\u2019s not much. When you first open up the new-generation version it will automatically carry over saved data and info if you played Madden NFL 21 previously, and everything you know, love, and hate about Madden currently is still intact, just as you remembered it -- for better and for worse. Maybe there was a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to subtly improve things, but it hasn\u2019t made a big impact while I\u2019ve been playing. However, despite the fact that it seems to be functionally the same game, there is no cross-generational multiplayer at all (and no cross-platform play) so you\u2019ll need to download the old version to play with friends that haven\u2019t had a chance to upgrade systems yet. Overall, Madden NFL 21 on the new generation of consoles suffers from the same problems and doesn\u2019t seem like a leap in quality at all. Maybe EA will finally make some changes next year. Similarly, the NFL pageantry around each game is still lacking. The pre-game highlight reel is full of players awkwardly celebrating even though the game hasn\u2019t started yet and it\u2019s missing the vast majority of stat blocks and recap cutaways you typically see during the actual NFL broadcasts Madden strives to simulate. On a related note, the half-time show is basically non-existent, especially in Franchise mode where its absence is especially conspicuous. A narrator will summarize a handful of games from around the league, it\u2019ll show a couple slow-motion highlights from your game, and then it\u2019s right back into the second-half kickoff. Where\u2019s the actual contextual commentary on what happened and how each side could improve? Where\u2019s the broadcast booth or analyst desk with commentators and interviews? Or at least something to fill that void? It all feels unfinished, which is disappointing considering how much this aspect has been lacking for several years and it was done better in much older games like ESPN NFL 2K5 or even in Madden NFL 10 . Instead, it\u2019s the same old song and dance. It\u2019s also been notably buggier than normal. Even after the first patch, playing on PlayStation 4 Pro, performance issues have made things incredibly frustrating across the board. During kicks I experienced framerate drops so extreme that it often resulted in missed field goals and terrible kickoffs through no fault of my own. During the Face of the Franchise campaign mode, Madden NFL 21 would hang up at loading screens after games, requiring me to quit out to the PS4 dashboard and start it back up multiple times. (Thankfully, my progress saved.) Classic Franchise mode often stuck at the player upgrade screen as well, also forcing me to reboot. Visual glitches have been minimal, but the performance hiccups made it extremely difficult to settle into a flow. I\u2019ve also seen other miscellaneous issues like my opponent randomly mirroring my entire team or textures tearing across the screen. Do You Believe in The Madden Curse, Where The Cover Athlete Is Doomed to a Bad Year? Yes, it's proven science I used to but it doesn't hold true anymore No, it was always a myth Answer See Results When things are running smoothly on the field, moment-to-moment gameplay feels a tiny bit faster than last year, with more precise animations for things like jukes and spins. As a ball carrier, using the right \u2018Skill Stick\u2019 feels more dynamic and fluid for pulling off evasive moves and overall blocking seems more realistic. Runners plant their feet well and make decisive cuts, so it all adds up to really satisfying goal line moments on both offense and defense. Last year it was far too easy to run over anyone and everyone if you knew what you were doing, but this year running lanes are narrower and require following blockers more precisely. This is also the first entry in recent memory that lets me throw the ball away relatively easily without taking a cheap sack. The way the \u2018Skill Stick\u2019 change works here also makes it far easier to combo together moves really fluidly, so you can prepare a stiff-arm right after a spin, for example, without breaking animation or waiting for the spin to finish. Madden NFL 21 still relies heavily on a canned animation system rather than actual inverse-kinematics physics simulation, so it\u2019s easy to spot repetition, but the smoothness of it all is great. Every IGN Madden NFL Game Review Ever 76 Images On the defensive side, pass-rushing as a lineman is a much deeper experience than in previous Maddens. There\u2019s an entire new Pass Rush ability system for the defensive line that includes new moves to help navigate blocks. Offensive linemen have new skills at their disposal as well. Also on the defensive side of the ball it\u2019s much harder now -- as it should be -- to play linebacker. In Madden NFL 20 it seemed like every linebacker in the league could run down speedy receivers and running backs while making superhuman leaps into the air to intercept bullet passes out of nowhere. If you know Madden well, you could cover the entire field with just an average middle linebacker. But while throw trajectories seem about the same this time around (generally too flat and low compared to the actual NFL) linebackers are thankfully toned down in effectiveness, with far fewer impossible-seeming moments. Defensive backs are much more aggressive on the interception front this year, to a point of near comedy with how quickly they can react and clamp down on curl routes or catch up to deep post routes. So if you play on All-Pro or All-Madden you can expect to throw more picks than you\u2019re used to at first. Two of the best additions from Madden NFL 2020, X-Factor and Superstar abilities, are back again this year, with a few new ones thrown into the mix. Superstar abilities are special attributes for stand-out players that enhance certain skills, such as Inside Deadeye, which grants perfect accuracy on normal throws inside the numbers on the field. X-Factor zone abilities, on the other hand, are almost like super powers when you activate them. For example, Ezekiel Elliot has the Freight Train zone ability that\u2019s activated by having three rushes for over 10 yards; once live, it puts Zeke in the zone, giving him an increased chance of breaking tackle attempts but also makes him get knocked out of the zone if he\u2019s tackled for a loss. I like the extension of this feature because it incentivizes leaning on star players and leveraging their strengths -- every team has powerful players like this, so strategies revolve around activating zone abilities and keeping them running. In the actual NFL players have a tendency of gaining momentum and taking over a game, just like this, so it\u2019s a believable and fun imitation of that. What We Said Last Year Madden NFL 20 Review Verdict By Robert Kollars - July 30, 2019 In addition to the usual incremental graphics upgrade and respectable new story campaign, Madden NFL 20 meaningfully improves on a lot of the issues that plagued the previous iteration(s). The running game is noticeably smoother and X-Factor traits make superstar players actually feel like a force to be reckoned with on the field, and while there are still problems that linger with animations, it\u2019s safe to say that EA Tiburon is making large strides in the right direction. That said, I\u2019m running out of patience for the Franchise mode to receive some revitalizing updates \u2013 it\u2019s still fun after all these years but Madden 20\u2019s Franchise doesn\u2019t feel substantially different from Madden 19\u2019s. Madden NFL 20 Score: 8.1 Read the full Madden NFL 20 Review A Face Only A Mother Could Love This year\u2019s version of the story-driven campaign mode is called Face of the Franchise: Rise to Fame (as opposed to last year\u2019s QB1: Face of the Franchise), and it\u2019s a genuinely bad story built around a paper-thin illusion that your actions and choices matter. You start all the way back in high school as the backup quarterback to local legend and rival, Tommy Matthews. Matthews is voiced by Tye Sheridan (best known as Cyclops from the recent X-Men movies) but the character is written in such a way that I can\u2019t help but roll my eyes anytime he shows up. Everything centers around Matthews\u2019 health condition and your internal struggle to support him and the team or capitalize on the opportunity to take over. Performances feel phoned in, animations are poor, and some of the most crucial scenes are inexplicably devoid of all voice acting. One way or the other, eventually you get a shot at the limelight, go on to become a star in college, and enter the Rookie Combine and NFL Draft. Playing NCAA games again, albeit briefly and fragmented, was a real treat -- except that nothing matters. You can intentionally tank every game and not complete a single pass, yet still get drafted because off-screen you lit up the scoreboard. You\u2019ll even get a chance to force your preferred team to pick you if you\u2019d like, or switch positions to running back or wide receiver. Face of the Franchise does do one smart thing: the story doesn\u2019t stop when you get to the NFL. Unlike last year, story moments continue to pop up over the years as you play through a sort of highlight reel of your career while your character discusses the key moments as a narrator in an interview. It\u2019s a good format that keeps me coming back for more, even if the writing is extremely clunky with awkward cutscenes. However, your rival, Tommy Matthews, is all but non-existent after you reach the NFL, which comes off as a huge waste of resources and potential. Bring All The Boys to The Yard The big new mode this year is called The Yard, and it has proved to be a bright spot in Madden NFL 21 even if it comes at the expense of other modes. At first glance it seems a bit like NFL Street or NFL Blitz, but it\u2019s actually nothing like those at all. Instead, The Yard is a completely new way to experience American football: a 6v6 mode that pits superstar-caliber players against one another in a ludicrously silly but oddly captivating backyard game. The closest comparison would be that it\u2019s trying to emulate how you may have played football with friends at school during recess, with fluid rules, lots of movement, and everyone lining up on both sides. There are no quarters or time limits here, and the field is only 80 yards long. Each side gets three offensive possessions, starting at their 20-yard line, with a 1st-and-20. There are no kickers so it\u2019s always four-down territory and when you give the ball back, it goes on the opponent\u2019s 20. To make matters even more complex, you can hike the ball to any player on your team and you can throw behind the line of scrimmage multiple times. You even get bonus points for interceptions or for throwing a TD after already passing it once. Heck, you can even go for three after a TD by lining up from the 20-yard line! With so many new and unexpected rules to learn The Yard is extremely jarring at first. On top of that, players dress up in bright, flashy clothing instead of typical uniforms, giving it a more jumbled look, and every person on the field is a top-tier talent at their position, which makes the margin for error even slimmer than usual. Giving up a big play usually results in a touchdown and, with only a handful of possessions to count on, coming back from a big deficit early on is extremely tough. Much of the gains The Yard makes in ingenuity, though, it gives up in its lack of depth. Other than unlocking a handful of customization cosmetics and experiencing the thrill of beating a stranger online, there isn\u2019t a whole lot to it. You can play solo or in team games with and against other players, but there isn\u2019t a Franchise structure or League format to go through other than a handful of stadiums with unique rulesets. It plays out like a tutorial for a deeper, more involved mode that never materializes. I enjoyed The Yard for what it is -- a nifty distraction from the real core of Madden -- but it doesn\u2019t have enough meat to satisfy on its own. Crafting the Ultimate Team Not much is new this year with Madden Ultimate Team (MUT), meaning you\u2019ll still see advertisements for microtransactions in loading screens and feel pressure to try it constantly, even if you have zero interest. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, the gist is that you open random packs of sports cards that each represent NFL players of today and yesteryear, and those cards make up your team -- like a living, breathing fantasy squad. You\u2019ll iterate and expand on that team over the course of the year by earning new cards through completing challenges, playing against other MUT squads online, and so on. The premise is cool enough -- basically merging the NFL with Collectible Card Game (CCG) ideas -- but it\u2019s so riddled with microtransactions it\u2019s hard to enjoy. Taking your team online invites unfair-feeling matchups against the legion of diehard fans that drop tons of money on building the best team as quickly as possible, and you\u2019ll find your progression painfully slow if you opt for going the no-cost route. It\u2019s a tedious grind that will all be erased when Madden NFL 22 comes out. The only really significant change to MUT this year is how abilities are capped. Previously, you\u2019d find yourself limited to only selecting three offensive and three defensive players to equip special abilities, but now each ability has an Ability Point (AP) cost and you\u2019ve got an AP cap for offense, defense, and special teams. This allows you to be more flexible with balancing your team and customizing it just right. Other than that, the onboarding experience is a bit better as well, with the inclusion of Rivalz, which is like a series of Arcade-style challenges to help jumpstart your team right out of the gate. Microtransaction Reaction Ever since Madden Ultimate Team made its debut over a decade ago in Madden NFL 10, fans have been harshly divided. By its very nature, MUT is full of microtransactions to speed up the process of building a great team and, in many cases, to let you outright purchase highly rated cards. Most purchases are in the form of card packs you can buy with in-game currency earned through normal gameplay or bought with real money. Packs are rated into different tiers that contain player cards of varying rank and rarity. If you want to be competitive within a reasonable amount of time, you\u2019re all but required to spend money or else you\u2019ll get destroyed by those that do online. Packs can get quite expensive as well. An All-Pro gold fantasy pack lets you pick two of five shown cards that are 75+ OVR or better for 500 points, or around $5 USD. To get 11 Clutch packs, which each contains a single 80+ OVR player and five 62+ OVR players is nearly $60 -- literally the cost of another game. EA will also sell you massive 24x Gridiron Bundles that include dozens of high-level cards for 12,000 points. But don\u2019t worry! You can save $20 and get that many points for just $100. As shocking as those prices are, it is at least entirely optional. The new challenges help alleviate the grind slightly, although it still takes far too long to reach parity with players that have deep pockets. The Yard also features optional microtransactions, but fortunately these are entirely cosmetic and the amount of in-game currency you earn is much more balanced here than in MUT -- it even scales with your player rank very evenly. Progression is fine in this mode, but it\u2019s still notable that real money has wiggled its way into this one too. Disenfranchised Speaking of the core of Madden, Franchise mode is once again relegated to background status and completely neglected. In Madden NFL 21 the main classic Franchise mode is almost identical to last year, all the way down to the menu visuals and on-screen layout -- and that means it\u2019s almost identical to Madden NFL 19, as well. It\u2019s like a case of deja vu, all over again. Last week you may have read my op-ed about the state of Madden\u2019s classic Franchise mode . I wrote that before playing Madden NFL 21 but everything still stands true. Other than expanded Wild Card rounds to match actual NFL rule updates, new X-Factor abilities that were added this year, and more authentic rookie contracts, it is literally identical to last year, with only vague promises of patches over time as a \u201clive service\u201d to look forward to. It\u2019s a shameful lack of attention for what is, historically, one of the franchise\u2019s most-played modes. Instead of focusing on the mode that actually lets you take over the career of a player, coach, or owner in the quest for Super Bowl victories, EA has shown a continued allegiance to cash-cow features such as Madden Ultimate Team and now, The Yard, which features additional microtransactions in spite of its lack of depth."

        "Content": "Once in a while, a game so good comes out that it makes you take on a new appreciation for gaming, and even life in general. Along with those gems, there are those games that fail to have any redeeming quality, and would actually be worth negative money in the bargain bin. Gravity Games Bike: Street. Vert. Dirt . is one of those games.   Gameplay  There's a saying that goes, \"This is so bad it's not even funny.\" This is one of those games that is so bad, it actually is funny. Well, at least when someone else is playing. Gravity Games Bike: Street. Vert. Dirt. attempts to rip off every good BMX game, but fails miserably. For starters, the game's control is about as responsive as a pet rock. I can't be positively sure whether the designers implemented joystick support or not. Although the controls are set up like many other BMX games, attempting to actually use these controls is where things first go horribly awry. Moving and turning about is practically an act of futility. Bikes will get stuck on the smallest bump in the level and sometimes intersect with geometry, causing you to crash. Getting the rider to stop can induce fits of rage, as they'll sometimes continue to slide forward like they're on ice, never mind the times when the brakes seem to just give out and your rider will refuse to stop at all.  The game's turning radius can is best compared to an ocean liner. Attempting to turn around in a tight area is nearly impossible, so venturing off into a more open section of the level is often necessary just to change direction. Timing jumps requires more luck than skill. Sometimes the rider will pop up immediately, and sometimes they'll ride forward for a few more feet before finally taking to the air.  Attempting to grind on anything is almost like flipping a coin. Sometimes your player will grind on rails or objects, and sometimes they'll just fall past them, or often even through them. What's odd about this is that sometimes your rider will be reasonably far from a rail, and pressing the grind button will cause your bike to get sucked over to it. Other times you may be directly over a rail, and pressing the grind button will just result in a thrown controller as the bike passes directly through the rail.  Performing tricks is only slightly easier than learning to do them in real life. Tricks cannot be buffered while launching from a ramp, so you must wait until your rider is fully airborne before attempting any tricks. While this doesn't sound too bad, the timing that this requires is completely frustrating since it's much more finicky than any other extreme sports game. Some of the trick timing doesn't make any sense either, as some harder tricks take a shorter time to complete than easier and supposedly quicker tricks.  The game includes manuals, although they're about as useful as a kick to the head. Although it's possible to do so in real life, Gravity Games Bike will not let you peddle while performing a manual, which makes getting from place to place while keeping your combo going almost impossible. The manual meter is also nonsensical and practically useless, as the full length of the meter is not always used. Sometimes your player may fall while the meter is close to the end, and sometimes they'll fall while it's still near the middle.  On the other end of the ludicrous spectrum is the grind meter. It's so ridiculously easy to balance that it's entirely possible to stall on the edge of a ramp for the entire three-minute run, or at least until it gets boring. Stalling on a rail or ramp is also far and away the easiest way to score points in the game. Hopping up onto a rail and then jumping twenty or so times will accelerate the score quickly enough that every other scoring method seems like a complete waste of time.  The repeated hopping on a rail works because the game doesn't penalize you for performing the same move dozens of times. The game also doesn't use multipliers, which makes using manuals even more useless. Performing multiple tricks in a combo will make holdable tricks, like grabs, accelerate in score faster, which is why hopping on a rail repeatedly and then balancing for a while works well. This accelerated scoring idea doesn't work well anywhere else besides stalling, since stringing together combos elsewhere is nearly impossible.  With the game including the word \"gravity\" in its title, one would assume that some measure of real world physics would be present. In fact, gravity is practically the only rule of physics that actually exists in this game at all, even as poorly as it's implemented. Players will fall through the level multiple times during runs, get stuck in the level geometry, crash into nothing, get stuck on pedestrians, and generally break the time-space continuum.  Something that is incredibly odd and confusing is that you'll sometimes spawn in completely random places after you crash. On some levels, this frequently causes your player to spawn in an area that hasn't been opened yet, or sometimes even inside of the level geometry, where you must then restart the level. Spawning inside of an unopened area also makes item collection goals annoying, since you have no way of getting back out to finish collecting stuff, and you must restart.  One of the only positive things about Gravity Games Bike is its level size. The levels are quite large, and luckily the game's draw distance is reasonably good. The levels are large enough that even with a three-minute run time, some of the collection goals can cause time to run a bit short.  But just like the old saying, it isn't the size of your levels that counts; it's how you use them. And once again, Gravity Games Bike fails in an astonishingly massive way. Most of the game's goals are incredibly easy, and often so stupid that your forehead will hurt from slapping it so much. There are the mandatory score goals, collecting letters to spell \"g-r-a-v-i-t-y\" and so on that are pretty much a staple of this genre. The score goals are done easily with the rail-hopping trick, so that quickly becomes a joke. The \"g-r-a-v-i-t-y\" letters are spread around the level in an almost last second manner.   The biggest jokes are the collection goals. One of the levels has you smash three computers, which sounds fine, until you learn that all three computers are right next to each other. The museum level has five swords that need to be found, and four of them are within about ten feet of each other and require no effort to grab. Most other collection goals are equally easy.  The levels are also sparsely decorated and the placement of lines is almost nonexistent. There are rails randomly placed that lead to nothing, and some rails that lead into a wall, forcing the end of a possible combo. Some areas have almost no way to transition to another, so roaming about the level in one continuous combo is out of the question.  The competition levels make absolutely no sense in how they score, but the computer bikers put up such low numbers that it's simple to win every competition. In one round, I scored around 120,000 points using the rail-hopping technique, with only one move used the entire round, and scored a \"70.9\" for the round. The next round I performed over 15 separate tricks multiple times, mixed grind and ramp tricks, and scored nearly 400,000 points. I was given a score of \"70.7,\" lower than my rail-hopping and singular move round. I never crashed in either round, so that wasn't an issue.  For those that like to torture their friends, there are a few multiplayer modes. Most of them are a complete waste of time, such as the Team Attack, where two players combine forces to score 100,000 points as fast as possible. Most every multiplayer mode is simply a slight twist on a high score competition, and gets boring quite fast. The only mode worth including is the High Scores mode, where players must score higher in four out of seven categories in order to win, such as longest grind, biggest air, etc. This mode might actually be fun in another game, where controls and gameplay were actually given some attention.   Graphics  Blind people are at an advantage here, as they won't be able to see just how bad this game's graphics can get. The player models are some of the worst in videogame history, and only slightly better than Football on the Atari 2600. The riders' knees are way too close to their feet, and everyone looks like they wear size 2 shoes. Hands are proportional to their feet, which is to say that they don't look like they could palm a golf ball. Everyone's shoulders are so disproportionate that regular clothing would never fit them, and their legs look like toothpicks below the knee.  If the player models weren't bad enough to look at while standing still, once they start moving things start getting uglier. Trick animations are terrible, but only get worse when you fail to land them. Bikes disappear as soon as anyone crashes, and the players flop and roll around in a spastic manner. They fail to react to the environment at all, and instead just convulse in a random fashion.  Textures don't help the horrible models or level design. Object textures don't match up properly, so ramps and whatnot completely stand out from their environment, instead of looking like they should be there. The artists likely forgot the hotkey to adjust texture placement in their level designer, as it's possible to see a misaligned texture from practically any viewpoint in the game.  The game's camera is so choppy and unpredictable that it's extraordinarily disorienting when first playing. Using ramps causes the camera to pop around as it follows the player, and the camera will often be facing the completely wrong direction when spawning after a crash. Occasionally it's impossible to tell where you've spawned at after a crash until you begin moving, and by that point you may have fallen off a ledge that you meant to have stayed on.  The podium stand at the end of the competitions is completely unfinished. Most competitions failed to draw any other contestants, except for a level or two where the third place contestant was drawn, but not the second. My rider's bike was missing every time, even though she was supposed to have leaned on it and then picked it up.   Sound  If you choose to purchase or rent this game, make a trip to your local craft or drug store and purchase a highlighter. Upon arriving home, use said highlighter on your remote's \"mute\" button. You're gonna need to find that button every time you fire this game up.  Riding over grates produces a sound similar to grating your nails over a chalkboard. Crashing with any of the female riders will cause them to make noises that sound either like they're sneezing or are enjoying an immense amount of pleasure. The rest of the sound effects are either as annoying or nonsensical as these.  The game includes some licensed music for its soundtrack, including Disturbed, Adema, Reveille and others. The licensed music isn't exactly bad, but it's all been heard before, and sounds exactly like every other average extreme sports game soundtrack.  Where things get even worse than thought possible is that the licensed music makes up only a small percentage of the total soundtrack. The rest of the tracks are written by complete unknowns, and it is some of the worst music in the history of mankind. If this music somehow gets played on airwaves and thusly makes it's way into space, our chances of making peaceful contact with extra-terrestrials has dropped through the floor, as this music will be considered an assault on anything that can hear, and our planet will be destroyed.

        "Content": "Professional basketball has a sense of style that is unique to the world of sports. The glowing arenas, fashionable apparel and high speed of the game are all unmatched. On the court, it\u2019s not just about the win or the loss, it\u2019s about the way you look doing it. NBA 2K19 builds upon its strong gameplay, fantastic presentation, and wide array of game modes to embody this attitude. Its style is cramped a bit by a small number of persistent issues with AI behavior and obscene microtransactions in the MyPlayer mode, but other than that, NBA 2K19 is a high point for the series. Getting into the action isn\u2019t as smooth as it could be because NBA 2K19 has a tougher learning curve than the series has in the past, one that rewards skill and punishes novice play. Even as a veteran of the series, I found myself getting pounded by the CPU on the default difficulty level as I relearned the old mechanics and adapted to a slew of defensive improvements that make dribble-drives much more difficult. (I actually found playing online against others who were struggling with the same things to be a better learning tool.) This year places a tremendous amount of emphasis on ball control and maximizing your players\u2019 abilities. Each time the buzzer rang, however, I felt myself getting a little better.  NBA 2K19 did an excellent job of rewarding me for taking the time to learn its various skill moves, including a complex post-game and set of dribbling techniques. Pulling off a Steph Curry step-back jumper or a Lebron James fadeaway is really satisfying, especially because of the work you need to put into learning them first. Unfortunately, the complex nature of the controls and movement system can lead to some really unflattering moments. A successful move leads to a beautiful animation that seems perfectly in tune with what you would see in any NBA game, but an unsuccessful attempt often results in your player running into the defender awkwardly. I\u2019ve seen instances where the AI will start a dribble move only to bump right into a defender, carrying them all the way into a backcourt violation. For a game that is usually so naturally fluid with its motion, these hiccups are easy to spot. Pulling off a Steph Curry step-back jumper or a Lebron James fadeaway is really satisfying. \u201c While it\u2019s an improvement over previous iterations, NBA 2K19 still struggles in transition. Floor spacing is a little better but still underwhelming. Despite playing as some of the best athletes in the world, the fast break still feels too slow to develop. There have been several instances where an easy transition dunk turns into my own teammate running right out in front of me and preventing that from happening. Even with guys like Russell Westbrook, who are traditionally phenomenal in transition, I\u2019d find myself having to settle for a jumper instead of being able to get to the basket. The AI does a nice job of distributing the ball to its playmakers, which really accentuates how different every player feels. Guys like Karl-Anthony Towns dominate the paint with their athleticism while someone like Jonas Valanciunas will make you pay if you let him pop out of the pick and roll. There have been instances, however, where the AI will actively avoid open players in order to get the ball to their superstar, which is a bit absurd. Off-ball movement is actually pretty good, which makes it even more frustrating that players will work themselves open for a shot and never get to touch the ball. The AI also has a really bad tendency to hold onto the ball beyond the three-point line, even when time isn\u2019t in its favor. Thankfully, this only happens a couple of times every game, but it\u2019s certainly jarring when the AI puts up such a good fight everywhere else. Every IGN NBA 2K Review Ever 24 Images  NBA 2K19 shines on the defensive end of the court thanks to tight controls and emphasis on player ratings. Lockdown defenders like Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard stand out against weaker defenders. As a compliment to the complex mechanics available on offense, defense became much more of a chess match. Predicting what moves they\u2019ll make and when they will make them becomes of the utmost importance, especially if you don\u2019t have a strong defense behind you. Making sure your roster has at least one or two defensive stoppers, even if they\u2019re lacking offensive talent like Andre Roberson, is now a priority. The most noticeable difference comes from the interior, where bigs are no longer content letting guys like James Harden blow by on a one-on-one dribble drive. It is hard to make the defensive side of things interesting and engaging, but it helps keep NBA 2K19 fun all of the time instead of just half of it.  More Than a Game  While the immense amount of animations dedicated to matching the identity of their real-life counterparts helps, players have a tendency to look a little strange from the neck down. Lebron James, who is large and muscular, shouldn\u2019t have the same body type as Rajon Rondo, who is trim by comparison. The players\u2019 faces do a fine job differentiating one player from the next, at least among the more popular stars, but it\u2019s still an odd look. Beyond player physique, NBA 2K19 is a masterclass in presentation. From before the tip-off to when the lights shut off in the arena, there is always fantastic quality and attention to detail. Clever in-game commentary can keep even a blowout game interesting through small anecdotal stories on the part of former NBA player Clark Kellogg or more personal details about players that add to the impact of what they are doing on the court. For instance, I never knew that Jimmy Butler likes to pay for other people\u2019s groceries while at the store. Hearing about it mid-game made me want to trade for him later that season. On top of that, there are excellent interviews \u2013 some that appear to be shot from a booth and others that are done on the court \u2013 with players using their real-life voices. Seeing someone like Dirk Nowitzki interviewed about basketball mechanics is a fun detail that feels thoroughly executed. Similarly entertaining are the pre and post-game shows from Ernie Johnson Jr., Charles Barkley, [Correction: that's Kenny Smith], and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. They possess the same unique chemistry and charm in NBA 2K19 as they do on TNT, providing both useful insight and comedic delivery that break up the seriousness of a sports match. The pre-game show transitions really well into the pizzazz of the on-court battle, where the arenas are theatrical and the attire is chic. Because of the depth in its presentation, no two games of NBA 2K19 ever feel the same, giving it more than ample replay value.  Thankfully, there are a dozen or so different ways to digest NBA 2K19\u2019s strong gameplay and presentation. The best, and perhaps the only mode that matches the intensity of the complex mechanics, is MyLeague. MyLeague allows you to build upon (or create from the ground up) an NBA franchise with an inordinate amount of customization. From something like the frequency of trades taking place across the league to the shade of orange you want the New York Knicks to have, nothing seems like it is off the table. This game mode really struck my desire to run the NBA the way I see fit, which included lots of unreasonable trades between superstars and the dismantling of the Golden State Warriors, and became the perfect medium for me to enjoy NBA 2K19\u2019s strengths.  The story never lacks for interesting conflict. \u201c NBA 2K19 also enjoys its strongest MyCareer mode yet with The Way Back, which is much more story-focused than in previous years. A.I., whose name might the most unfortunate part of the mode due to the NBA\u2019s history with a more well-known player by the same nickname in Allen Iverson, is a complicated protagonist who isn\u2019t always reasonable or kind. The resulting story of his attempt to be picked up in the NBA feels personal, and certainly more pragmatic than I expected from a franchise that has really struggled in this regard. The story never lacks for interesting conflict, but it starts to run out of creative juice toward the back end. A.I.\u2019s constant struggle to learn that the scope of professional basketball goes beyond his own wellbeing is a theme that goes to the well one too many times. Sadly, while The Way Back poses as an RPG with impactful decisions that can be made at various points throughout the story, in a second playthrough I found that, at least early on, these choices have very little impact on the storyline. Similarly, the way I performed in the games that took place in between cutscenes seemed to have very little to do with the direction of A.I.\u2019s career. There were moments where I\u2019d perform horribly, only to be told in a cutscene afterward that I had the game of a lifetime. Also, the teammate grade you are given as a result of your performance is incredibly inconsistent, as it would dock an unreasonable amount of score for things out of your control while barely adding any for things like setting screens. All the same, the writing is unusually strong for a game mode like this and appearances from Anthony Mackie and Haley Joel Osment bring life to a fun and relatively short (at about five hours) MyCareer mode. Not all of the game modes felt as well worth my time as MyLeague and MyCareer. NBA 2K\u2019s foray into the card-opening business feels all too familiar, with currency being a little too hard to come by \u2013 especially because it\u2019s the same currency you use to bolster A.I.\u2019s stats in MyCareer. Naturally, 2K is willing to sell you virtual currency to speed along the process, but that comes at a frighteningly high cost. Normal packs range anywhere from about $5 to $10 where more expensive boxes go for double of that. Even the more expensive packs don\u2019t guarantee you the players you want, so I was much happier to spend the $25 worth of currency that came with the Anniversary Edition on my MyPlayer. Without dedicating major time to MyTeam, it\u2019s hard to imagine being competitive with people who will shell out the cash for a better team. Thankfully, MyLeague is entirely devoid of these microtransactions, making it much easier to enjoy without any second thought.  There is also a Blacktop mode that includes street basketball, whether it be one-on-one half court or five-on-five full court. I had fun here playing as some of my favorite NBA legends, like John Stockton and Allen Iverson, but I couldn\u2019t help but wish the gameplay branched off into something more exaggerated and along the lines of NBA Street or NBA Jam. Instead, it feels like a slightly modified version of what you\u2019d normally see in NBA 2K19.  My time with online play was mostly positive, with the largest issue being a very small delay between the push of a button and the resulting action. Unfortunately, when the shooting mechanics rely almost entirely upon that timing, it can lead to some frustrating misses or turnovers that may not have happened otherwise. This was especially easy to notice when shooting free throws, which became almost impossible to time. At its worst, I did have some instances when online where it would freeze altogether, taking me out of control for chunks at a time. It\u2019s unfortunate because there is a real element of strategy when facing a human opponent and some of that is lost in the latency. But if you don\u2019t have someone to play with locally, the thrill of going back and forth with another player, especially with the improved defense which largely removed cheap ways of scoring easily, is still worth the effort."

When you harbor nothing but bitter resentment for a cellphone game that you charged on your buddy's borrowed account for $1.99, you can never come back from that. The Game Boy line has been the unworthy sufferer for some of the most sickening games to come along since the Official Nintendo Seal of Quality was proven a misnomer with NES bombs like Total Recall. And sadly, our plucky little Nintendo DS system has not escaped this fate. You take the good, you take the bad, and oh man, are you ever going to be taking it bad if you pick up King Kong on DS this holiday season.  Saying that Peter Jackson's King Kong on DS is loosely based on Michel Ansel's flawed but powerful masterpiece for consoles is a slap in the ape-face of that game. This DS thing was rushed out the door to tag onto the movie and game releases, boxed up way before it arrived at any state of playability or visual style. Maybe they should have waited for the DVD to release a DS version, giving it time to be as great as it could have been? Or maybe they should have just done an updated version of the GBA Kong game (which is lo-fi but at least has some direction to it) instead of making a brand new game for DS? Unfortunately, it's too late to save Kong, and what we DS gamers are stuck with is not worth anybody's time. At its very best (and I'm not sure how I worked the word \"best\" into this review), King Kong on DS is a completely pointless FPS / button-pushing-punching-thingy that has not a single moment worth playing when you can experience the story and gameplay concept in its full form on PC or console. At its very worst (go ahead and get used to that word, \"worst\"), it's so pathetic and busted that you can't tell whether you're shaking with anger or laughter.     Looking at the screenshots of the game, you might get the idea that this is a poor man's Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and so it might be of interest to FPS fans. Hmm, how to persuade you to ignore that thought. Well, across this game's 17 levels, I'd say I killed maybe 40-50 creatures.  Even that might be generous, although I did kill a few annoying bees while trying to fight the junk-ass aiming system to shoot the hive ... and I did run past (or rather walk) a few creatures because I was so bored in fighting that I just cut out.  Either way, if you only fight off three or four critters per stage (or go through an entire stage without really having to fight because the creatures attacking are bats and little raptors, and you're freaking King Kong and can just walk over them) that's not a lot of action. And the action you do get repeats over and over. If there's a hole in the wall, a crab will crawl out of it. There may be another crab after that, or not. If you enter a clearing, a raptor will probably jump over the wall and come at you. If you see sky, there will be about six bats to shoot down. If you're Kong, there will be a T-Rex to punch either at the bottom of a ravine or behind a door you've smashed, and once you've beaten up that T-Rex (or simply walked past it), you're probably done with the stage. Enemies don't have any AI besides \"get 'im!\", and if you walk far enough away, they go back into their holes.   I'm not sure which is worse: shooting crabs and shooting crabs and shooting crabs and shooting crabs, or not having any crabs (or anything else) to shoot at for long sections of this shooter. I guess the gunplay isn't the worst it could possibly be -- there's only so far you can go wrong in using the DS touchscreen like a trackball -- but it's pretty bad. The DS version uses that \"be the character\" aspect of no reticules or on-screen indicators (except that the second screen, aside from one single giant and pointless big Skull Island picture, is taken up with ammo indicators, so moot to that concept), so you've basically got no clue where the hell your shots are going. That's not so much a problem though, because the developers have accounted for it by making most everything that's not shot at a distance register as shot. I was flinging spears with my eyes closed and hitting creatures. The only creature that ever caused me problems was the giant super-crab, but aiming wasn't the problem there. The thing just absorbed shots without reacting much (the trick seems to be to shoot him in his ... let's call it a face, until he rears up and lets you flip him over so you can shoot him some more. We're not 100% sure that it's the face where he can be hurt, but we've unloaded every round we had everywhere else on his body and he didn't die, so we tried the face and something seemed sort of to happen.)  What is bad about the control is that your character walks with all the speed of a zombie, and in firefights, the game will inexplicably slow down your movement (the graphics seem to still be animating, so either it's selective slowdown or else your enemies have coated their lairs with superglue.) The game is riddled with numerous bugs, so you may find yourself falling through the ground and into an abyss when trying to explore in the dark, or fighting a raptor who has jumped off a ledge, fallen through the floor, and is now battling you invisibly from underneath the ancient Skull Island temple tiles. The handling also isn't tuned for the thumbstrap and is hard to control with it, so you're stuck with tiring stylus aiming for the duration.  Puzzle portions don't do much better, because the word \"puzzle\" fits only if you cram it. The smartest section I saw in the game had me ducking between pillars while a Venatosaurus tried to chase me. That was mildly clever the first time, not so much by about the fourth time. That's contrasted with one of the most ridiculously stupid stages I've ever seen that goes a little something like this: there's a ledge that's about as tall as a park bench in front of me, but the hero of the game can't climb up it, so he has to call his partner over (who can climb it) so that he can operate the winch for the rope gondola, located on the far side of the level, to carry me up and over to the knee-heights of that daunting ledge.  And what about the star of the show, King Kong? He's barely in the game at all. You do play as him in a few stages, but there's no gamplay in these levels other than in pushing the button when you get to a barrier or ledge to have him smash or jump. You can fight the little critters that attack, but they just take one mighty swipe, and they don't bother you much if you avoid them. All of the tree-swinging is scripted, so no play there, and the biggest challenge with climbing along rock walls is in fighting to regain control when the camera loses track of the building-sized gorilla. You do get to fight a T-Rex now and again, but the developers completely botched the furious (albeit shallow) combat system for the DS version. Fighting doesn't feel fluid and is a pain to control, and it doesn't even use the DS touchscreen -- how can you make a game for DS about a massive creature like Kong and not find a use for that touchscreen?   King Kong on DS is ugly as hell, for the little of it that I could see. The game is murky, foggy and dark throughout, with no brightness setting. There are no lighting effects in the game. There are torches, but they just sit there on the wall, not even animating. Wall textures would be passable if it wasn't for the bright white seam along most edges that shows the corners of almost every polygon. Characters in the game are drawn with maybe four colors. Luckily, those four colors are brown and tan instead of black and dark brown, so at least you can see them. Not that you'd want to ... the game draws Naomi Watts as having one big, heart-shaped nostril in the middle of her triangular nose. Jack Black looks like a burlap bag -- not even a burlap bag with eyes, just a sack out in the jungle. And the gunshot bursts ... wow. It'd be more realistic if they had a flag with the word \"Bang!\" pop out when you shot than to have whatever-the-heck effect they did use. There's this brown, mushy, hand-drawn blotch that comes out of your firearm when you shoot, and I don't know why. Our guess is that they took the cartoon-style explosion effects from the Star Wars Episode III game and pasted them in here for some reason (the exact same cartoon explosion blows up when a bomb goes off, which looks ridiculously cartoonish in an otherwise realistic 3D world), and again, I have no clue why. The only thing that looks good in the game is Kong himself, since his animation is partially lifted from the console game (there might even be technology ported in this one 3D character -- when he falls down dead, there seems to be ragdoll in how he falls since we've seen him die while standing up against a wall.) The dinos aren't exactly embarrassing either; the buck-toothed giant bats, however, very much are.    "

        "Content": "It can be difficult for an MMA game to balance two seemingly contradictory halves: being both a satisfying sports simulation as well as a satisfying fighting game. Lean too hard toward simulation and you could alienate all but the most dedicated fans \u2013 but, move too far toward the crowd pleasing violence of something like Mortal Kombat , you might stray from that \u201cas real as it gets\u201d tagline instead. Finding the perfect mix of both sides is what makes EA Sports UFC 5 the best MMA game to date. It deftly balances these approaches into something much more fluid and life-like than past entries while also raising the stakes of every hit thanks to an impressive new damage system, which makes matches more exciting, risky, and rewarding. UFC 5 is the first game in the series to carry an \u201cM for mature\u201d ESRB rating, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. In UFC 4, fights never felt as high stakes as they do in a real MMA match, mainly because visible injuries were few and far between, and wounds didn\u2019t continually bleed over time. Additionally, a finish was often necessitated by a Health Event from a particularly damaged area (Head, Body, Legs) which was hard to see coming at a glance. UFC 5 counteracts this by making the results from damage much more realistic, with more sophisticated Health Events that have a deeper impact on the player. For example, if you take a lot of shots to the face, it could break your nose and create cuts above your eyes. Icons in the shape of eyes and lungs will then appear under your health bar as a result, indicating both a loss of vision and difficulty breathing for your fighter. This can leave you with diminished capabilities, forcing you into making tough but rewarding decisions to either weather the storm and heal up between rounds or go for broke and try to finish your opponent before it\u2019s too late. What we said about EA Sports UFC 4 EA Sports UFC 4 is a largely iterative sequel that tightens up some looser parts, makes a few smart tweaks here and there, and doesn\u2019t rock the boat all that much. And in that sense, it\u2019s a success. The new submission system is a big improvement over prior years, there are some great changes to career mode that make it much more fun to mold a fighter that suits your own playstyle, the new grapple assist system is a great tool to help complete newcomers not feel lost if they get taken down, and as a whole, the fighting system remains incredibly deep. Longstanding problems still remain in the ground game and some dated visuals, but without any competition for the title, EA Sports UFC 4 still remains the king of combat sports. - Mitchell Saltzman, Aug 14, 2020 Score: 8 Read the full EA Sports UFC 4 review . The animations on fighter faces have undergone significant changes, with a total of 64,000 facial injury combinations possible. The results are unique to each fight, accruing minute by minute and round by round. This means that a cut you open up on an opponent in Round 1 can be exploited throughout the rest of the match until there\u2019s a finish or a potential doctor stoppage \u2013 a newly added feature where, just like in real life, a doctor will step in, assess the damage, and discern if a fighter is fit to continue. In addition to depicting damage very vividly, blood and sweat from strikes will drop and accrue on the mat itself, so you can see the result of your work in a Jackson Pollack-like design below you as the fight continues. The new damage system is further complemented by UFC 5\u2019s knockout finishes, which show a highly cinematic slow-motion replay that feels like you\u2019re watching a finishing move in Tekken rather than a simple replay in a sports game. The new damage system and replays completely augmented my approach. \u201c The revised damage system and slow-motion KO replays completely augmented my approach. Earning a KO has never been more satisfying, and I found myself chasing them no matter the risk they incurred. That\u2019s partly because there are impressive new fall animations for KO\u2019d fighters from the standing position where they\u2019ll drop face first into the mat, which have a depth and weight to them that look like an actual person dropping to the ground. That said, there are still some pretty stilted animations when a fighter is KO\u2019d and falls onto their back. There is a tendency for their neck to jut forward and their limbs to hover a few inches above the mat just like in UFC 4. I was happy to see, though, that there were new and improved animations for TKOing a fighter on ground and pound strikes. In UFC 4, the finished fighter would still do the strange chicken neck animation where their head hovers above the mat, but now they\u2019ll roll onto their side and curl into the fetal position (known as \u2018turtling\u2019) which is a really nice touch.

An added bonus here is how the walkouts of specific fighters like Islam Machachev or Alex Perreira are based on their actual movements instead of just applying the same stock animations to every single fighter. Their designs are also uniformly excellent, creating a really solid likeness of my favorites both mid-match and during cutscenes. This personalization goes a long way in making UFC 5 feel unique and intentional. Attack animations are much, much smoother. \u201c Attack animations are much, much smoother, too, as the control system within UFC 5 has undergone a pretty significant overhaul for the better. Every move I attempted felt more fluid, real, and responsive, making UFC 4 seem positively clunky in comparison. Striking your opponent, especially with kicks, is refreshingly crisp and authentic, both looking better while giving you more agency over your fighter. Defense has also been redone as blocks are much stronger, preventing flash knockouts and easy overpowering. There\u2019s a real snap to the movements now, and that added sense of realism is more exciting as I was able to build combos better and move much more nimbly than before. Another really nice touch is how smaller weight classes move much faster than the heavier ones, mirroring reality, which creates more variety fight to fight. Which sports series has the best Career Mode? NBA 2K Series, MyCareer MLB The Show, Road to the Show EA Sports FC/FIFA, Career Mode EA Sports Madden, The League EA Sports UFC, Career Mode Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results The new flow-based grappling and renewed submission system also removes the annoying minigames that plagued UFC 4. Those minigames often felt like a non-sequitur in the context of a fighting game, dramatically slowing down the action to focus on mechanics that you quite literally never use in any other situation. Now there is a simplified, intuitive control system which just has you move your left or right stick to change positions on the ground. There is also a hybrid setting where both simplified and complex choices are presented, which I really liked because it made it easier for me to escape from the bottom position by just pushing the left stick up. It also made doing more complex moves on top easier, so I could change positions quickly and then select a more complicated submission move to try. As a result, I found myself doing wrestling slams more easily in the 20+ hours I\u2019ve played of UFC 5 than in the 150+ hours I have in UFC 4. Additionally, grappling and submission power was rebalanced so you won\u2019t find yourself pinned to the ground for the majority of rounds or finished quickly by wrestler and jiu jitsu style fighters, which was always a previous point of frustration. Career Mode is deeper and more engaging than ever before. \u201c UFC 5\u2019s Career Mode is the main attraction here, and I\u2019m pleased to say that it\u2019s deeper and more engaging than ever before. Career Mode is given a fresh coat of paint with an improved home page as well as some lifestyle fixes, such as the ability to simulate trainings that you\u2019ve already completed in order to get to your fight quicker instead of grinding for forty minutes on repetitious drills before every match. Even so, the grind itself is a lot more enjoyable because Coach Davis, reprising his role from UFC 4, barks out four different challenges for every three minute sparring session versus just one specific challenge. This creates a lot more variety and dimension to your training, pushing you to beat each challenge within the timespan to open up the next. These challenges mix both straightforward directives, like landing any strikes until you reach ten, with others that are a bit more difficult, such as evading strikes by moving your head. Every IGN UFC Game Review 11 Images As a relatively seasoned UFC player, I even found myself timing out or straight up failing the evasion challenges here and there \u2013 they were difficult enough to frustrate me, but not bad enough that they drove me away from playing entirely. The new damage system has interesting reverberations as you train in Career Mode as well. Getting cut during sparring is easy if you\u2019re not careful, and it\u2019ll result in penalties to both the amount of time you can train within the week as well as the money you earn. This is especially important in the early stage of your career when money is in short supply. There are quite a few additional cutscenes with Coach Davis now, too, and they\u2019re much better written this time. Coach Davis\u2019s presence throughout is not only welcome but actively missed once his scenes become less prevalent as you move from the minor leagues to the UFC. But the presence of UFC star Valentina Shevchenko as a coach and guide is a welcome addition that helps make the Career Mode actually feel like a real story. Her scenes are admittedly pretty rare, however, rendering her appearance something more like a novelty cameo than a substantive contribution. Microtransaction Reaction UFC 5, like its predecessor, utilizes an in-game virtual currency called UFC points that can be purchased with actual money costing as low as $2.49 all the way up to $99.99. Thankfully, the points are only used to add customization to your custom fighters in the form of unlockable gear, emotes, player cards, and other such items versus something more consequential like Evolution Points which can be used to improve your fighter\u2019s attributes. If you\u2019re not interested in shelling out the money for these points, everything that\u2019s purchasable with UFC points can be earned by completing various challenges in both online and offline modes. Other elements of Career Mode could have used some more TLC, too, such as some of the copy/paste dialogue lifted right from UFC 4 for a good portion of the social media interactions. I also have some minor frustrations with the lack of new tattoo designs and haircuts for custom fighters. But these shortcomings are eased by small additions elsewhere, such as a deeper sense of fan interaction on social media, like promising the type of finish you\u2019re going for in a fight or pledging to block half of the shots that are thrown your way. There\u2019s a significant improvement in Fight IQ with the CPU characters you\u2019ll face throughout all the modes. Even at Normal difficulty, I had to both attack and defend more thoughtfully because my opponents had a much better sense of timing and counters. You\u2019re still able to choose your difficulty at the outset of your Career Mode journey, but UFC 5 even calls out the noticeable uptick in difficulty as you reach higher in the rankings, automatically bumping you up a notch once you\u2019re in Championship fights. Thankfully, you\u2019re still able to restart matches if you end up losing a fight in vicious fashion. This is helpful since many of the career goals you have, once again, revolve around having a high amount of consistent victories. These small additions really rounded out the Career Mode, while the depth to the story and more nuanced fight mechanics allow for even more replayability. I\u2019m really excited to take fighters across a few different weight classes through the mode. Tanner's Favorite Sports Simulation Games In honor of UFC 5's release, I'm putting together a quick list of sports simulation games that I enjoy. See All EA Sports UFC 5 Electronic Arts Skate 3 Black Box MLB The Show 19 SIE San Diego Studio NHL 23 EA Canada FIFA 23 EA Canada ESPN NBA 2K5 Visual Concepts Offline modes such as Quick Fight are still present, but are augmented by the new Fight Contracts mode where one-off matchups are generated each day. These contracts are generally lower risk but promise in-game currency that can be used to unlock new clothing, celebrations, and more. Fight Contracts will vary in style (going from simulation MMA to Stand and Bag, for example) and difficulty (going from Normal to Legendary), creating a more stimulating and exciting experience than a user-curated Quick Fight. I found these fights to be really engaging if I wanted to key into a single one-off match versus delving further into Career Mode or fighting online. I am excited to spend more time in the new Online Career mode. \u201c The final major innovation to note in UFC 5 is Online Career mode. The online Ranked Fights and Quick Fights are still available, but, for the first time, you\u2019re able to take a custom fighter into online competition and earn evolution points to improve their attributes. If you\u2019re planning to use the same fighter you build a career mode with, you\u2019ll only be able to transfer their appearance but not their attributes \u2013 and while this might seem frustrating at first, it really helps even the playing field. You won\u2019t be able to outclass anyone right away unless it\u2019s on pure playing ability and vice versa. As someone who really appreciates both the offline Career Mode and online play, I am really excited to spend more time with this mode. You tend to get a lot more unique, even strange fights when playing against a real person on the other side of the octagon."

        "Content": "This review covers the single-player campaign of Homeworld 3. For thoughts on the multiplayer skirmish and War Games co-op mode, see the Homeworld 3 Multiplayer review . Considering Homeworld 2 came out more than 20 years ago (and was remastered in 2015) it\u2019s a welcome surprise how little had to change \u2013 and how little complexity had to be sacrificed \u2013 to bring this classic, large-scale space strategy gameplay up to modern standards and deliver a visually spectacular and mechanically varied campaign. Building and controlling an armada of strike craft, frigates, and capital ships in full 3D space is certainly a little tricker to wrap your head around than most RTS games, but thanks to the ability to pause and give orders at any time you can grow into command at your own pace. The payoff is more than worth it, and this campaign invites you to embrace your inner Admiral Akbar and walk into traps just to blast your way out. Using a now well-worn template for soft-rebooting a series, this story follows a brand-new character who must seek out the original protagonist after they go missing \u2013 in this instance, 20 years prior. Despite that cliche, Imogen S\u2019jet\u2019s search for answers about what happened to Karan S\u2019jet\u2019s lost fleet is delivered with convincing emotion. That includes some very reasonable conflict between her and her second in command as he tries to keep her on the task of tracking down the looming new threat to Hiigara and the galaxy at large they were sent out after in the first place. Homeworld 3 Gameplay Screenshots 71 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Thanks in large part to its fully animated cinematics (as opposed to the Homeworld series\u2019 traditional hand-painted animatics), Imogen feels more human and relatable than Karan ever did, despite being hooked into the same fleet-controlling machines, wearing the same skin-tight wetsuit, and floating in another goo-filled tank with her eyes closed. But she gets to stretch her legs and emote more during the visions she has while the Mothership hyperspace jumps between missions, and that\u2019s where we get to know her a little better. In sharp contrast to the massive scale of the city-sized Mothership flying through the wreckage of even more gargantuan megastructures, these cutscenes feel small and intimate; we only ever really see four characters, so it\u2019s almost like watching a stage play. One of those characters is the antagonist, The Queen, who comes across as a bit over-the-top maniacal but chews the scenery with gusto and conveys a menacing, wild-eyed sort of madness. There\u2019s clearly something not right with her \u2013 and that allows her to be tragic and sympathetic in certain moments. That said, I did roll my eyes a bit when she recites Darth Vader\u2019s \u201cJoin me and rule by my side\u201d speech almost verbatim (she is not, as it turns out, Imogen\u2019s father). And while her use of hyperspace as a weapon sounds cool, it mostly happens off screen and we aren\u2019t given a real sense of how it\u2019s causing all this destruction. The one time we see it in action on a small scale raises a bunch of intriguing possibilities for how it could be used in battle\u2026 but then, anticlimactically, it\u2019s never seen again. So while the characters work on an emotional level, the overarching story does end up feeling a bit lost amid its tangle of lore about space ancients. Which sci-fi show or movie has your favorite spaceship battles? (pew pew pew!) Star Wars Star Trek Battlestar Galactica Babylon 5 The Expanse Other - Tell us in the comments Answer See Results When the view zooms out to the battlefield, Homeworld 3 immediately recaptures the feeling of controlling a fleet of starships, and being able to select a group of ships and put them into one of several formations \u2013 from a delta V to a sphere to a claw \u2013 and toggle between three different behavior stances is as powerful as ever. Taking in the details as capital ships bombard each other with ballistic weapons and laser beams, their turrets swiveling to track the fighter craft weaving between them leaving streaks of color behind, as explosions constantly go off will never, ever get old. I\u2019m often willing to take more losses than I need to in battle just so I can zoom in, turn off the interface (a one-button convenience), and enjoy the show. I\u2019m often willing to take more losses than I need to in battle just so I can enjoy the show. \u201c Sure, you\u2019ll get better results by meticulously organizing your ships into control groups, optimizing formations, and prioritizing targets to take out threats to your best ships first (and you\u2019ll need to on higher difficulties). But once you\u2019re confident you have the upper hand, there\u2019s nothing wrong with hitting F4 to select every combat-capable ship in your fleet and ordering them to pick their own targets according to what they\u2019re best at, and blast everything in sight. Those targets are almost entirely ships of the Queen\u2019s Incarnate fleet, and there are a couple of moments where in-engine cutscenes call back to the original Homeworld by making their fighters feel like an aggressive pack of animals. There are differences between how the enemy fleet operates versus the Hiigarans, but those are mostly relevant in multiplayer; in the campaign, they\u2019re effectively very similar to your own ships (outside of how you have to keep an eye out for pesky capture corvettes that can nab your frigates while you aren\u2019t watching and turn them against you). After fighting the Taiidan Empire and the Vaygr in previous games, I admit I\u2019d hoped for a more dramatic departure from the standard enemy fleet template this time, but the Incarnate certainly put up a decent fight.

That\u2019s mostly because of the new direction in map design. Previous Homeworld games have spiced up deep space with colorful nebulas as backdrops, but are largely set in huge empty voids with just a few asteroids floating around in them. Homeworld 3, by contrast, has so many massive objects to navigate through that space can feel downright claustrophobic and cluttered with ancient alien ruins, and often telegraphs choke points where the enemy will warp in. They\u2019re still huge maps relative to most real-time strategy games, of course, but scaling back on the scope means there\u2019s a lot less of building up a fleet and sending it on a long journey toward a target, and that\u2019s a good change that keeps downtime to a minimum. MIssions take us to very different and visually striking regions of space. \u201c Several of the mission maps are set within enormous metallic superstructures built by The Progenitor ancients who created the hyperspace cores, which are impressively massive but tend to be a bit industrial and flat. Others, however, take us to very different and visually striking regions of space. After the opening sequence has the Mothership lifting off and doing its shakedown cruise within the atmosphere of Hiigara itself (a first for this series unless you count the ground-based action of Deserts of Kharak), we get missions in a fast-moving asteroid field where you simply have to make it to the other side without your ships getting smashed, another where you must navigate through a crevasse in an enormous ice sheet undetected, lead a small strike group to take out explosive targets without support, and more. (It\u2019s a little silly that the ability to rotate the new horizontal Mothership on its axis exists, but as a fan of the distinctive Space Banana design of old I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re given the option \u2013 even if it\u2019s just to fit through one tight, vertical space.) Maps frequently made me stop to appreciate their awe-inspiring scope, especially when we\u2019re reminded every so often that these ships we\u2019re throwing around are actually huge and full of people. That\u2019s something that\u2019s easy to forget when you\u2019re zoomed out and watching green and red dots disappear from the tactical map or seeing the distant flash of a capital ship flaming out. Managing all of that is no small feat, of course, and the controls for Homeworld have always been a bit tricky, given that there\u2019s a whole extra axis of movement to account for than in most real-time strategy games. Homeworld 3 allows you to revert to the camera control scheme from Homeworld Remastered Collection, where your view is bound to a ship or other object and you can rotate around it, but by default you\u2019re given full control of the camera using WASD controls to fly through space, with the option of anchoring to a ship. I think I mostly prefer the old controls, simply because it\u2019s quite easy to accidentally drift off away from the action, but I\u2019m glad the option exists \u2013 and in fact, the degree to which the controls and UI are customizable is pretty impressive, with all manner of toggles for how you want them to behave. The pressure to get orders right on the first try is relieved by the pause button. \u201c But no matter what you choose, getting your ships to move to a precise location can involve swinging the camera around so you can view it from different angles, and that can be frustrating to pull off in a hurry. However, in the single-player campaign at least, the pressure to get it right quickly is completely relieved by the fact that you can pause (or slow time) with the push of a button and fiddle with things until you\u2019ve positioned your orders exactly the way you want them. What We Said About Homeworld 3's Multiplayer Modes Homeworld 3\u2019s multiplayer modes deliver both a safe, traditional skirmish sandbox that we expect from any RTS and also a more novel, three-player co-op mode in War Games. The fact that the two factions are only slightly asymmetrical and the map selection is so slim makes skirmishes feel a little barebones, though as always Homeworld's three-dimensional strategy gameplay offers different opportunities to outthink your opponents in a style of competitive multiplayer battle you won't find elsewhere. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a ton of immediate thrills and long-term potential in War Games thanks to its randomized upgrades that allow co-op partners to specialize their fleets to concentrate on taking down different types of threats and handle anything that might come their way. Score: 8 Read the full Homeworld 3 multiplayer review That said, whether or not your orders will be obeyed to the letter is another question. Ship behavior is a little iffy, and sometimes I\u2019ve had groups get caught on obstacles, fail to acknowledge they have a line of sight on a target, refuse to grab an object marked as salvageable on the map, or simply not move at all despite repeated requests and asking nicely. That was especially true of getting the big, slow battlecruisers to move in formation, but since they\u2019re only unlocked for the final mission that wasn\u2019t exactly a constant issue. It\u2019s also frustrating when ion frigates and bombers literally can\u2019t hit the broad side of a battlecruiser because they seem to be targeting the very tail end rather than its center mass, and from certain angles they consistently miss their shots. Ship behavior is a little iffy. \u201c Being able to pause also mostly alleviates one of my main gripes with how Homeworld 3\u2019s Hiigaran fighters and corvettes behave on their default neutral stance when approached by an enemy ship, which is to shoot back but not scramble. This leaves them sitting ducks, and if you didn\u2019t notice they were in danger ahead of time, you\u2019ll probably be too late to save them \u2013 and building new strike craft while your Mothership or carrier are under fire requires you to select each one as it emerges and change its stance or giving it orders immediately. Much of this terrain has tunnels you can pass ships through in order to bypass defenses and hit a target, but I wasn\u2019t wild about these. For starters, they seem like the only way to succeed in the missions where they\u2019re available, so using them doesn\u2019t feel like a clever maneuver so much as the one thing I could\u2019ve done \u2013 like a tutorial, but still happening late in the campaign. After the first novel time it doesn\u2019t seem all that interesting, and it kind of makes the bad guys look silly for not laying mines at the exit. Also, it can be a hassle to get a formation of fighters, bombers, and corvettes to fly through them smoothly \u2013 pausing makes it manageable, but they still often get caught on the edges. The Best PC Games 26 Images Another Homeworld 3 idea born of all of these objects floating in space is that it gives you surfaces to stick deployable turrets to. They\u2019re a bit finicky to place \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear why you can put them in one spot but not another \u2013 but you can redeploy them as needed, so there\u2019s lots of flexibility. There\u2019s one mission built around them that shows how effective they can be if you manage to turn an area into a chokepoint. It has to be said that, relative to Homeworld 2, Homeworld 3 feels simpler. I miss the flexibility, options, and rewards that came from mechanics like subsystem targeting brought. Without that, the only real nuance to battering down an enemy\u2019s battlecruiser\u2019s HP bar \u2013 beyond choosing suitable anti-capital ship weapons for your attack \u2013 is positioning your ships to hit it from the rear for a damage bonus. But that\u2019s hard to do considering how much ships move and rotate around in combat, so the only way to manage it consistently is to fully surround your target. Also, without veterancy (where ships that\u2019ve seen enough combat get stat bonuses) to think about, ships feel entirely disposable; you do get to carry your surviving fleet from one mission to the next, but since they\u2019re no stronger all that saves you is a little bit of time spent harvesting resources to get up and running at the beginning, and you can choose to start with a default fleet instead if you want. On the other hand, this game marks a return to building individual fighters instead of entire squadrons at once as we do in Homeworld 2, and that adds a welcome bit of extra control to how groups are composed. While I appreciated the variety of settings and objectives throughout the campaign, I was left wishing it\u2019d taken more cues from StarCraft 2 in its design when it comes to replayability. There are no optional objectives to try for on a subsequent run, and because each ship has just one upgrade to unlock (which makes them feel obligatory rather than optional) instead of a choice between two or more mutually exclusive options, there\u2019s no real reason to come back for another go other than the simple challenge of cranking up the difficulty another notch. It\u2019s kind of a bummer not to have that variety available in the campaign, particularly when I look at the ship variants introduced in the War Games multiplayer mode. That\u2019s especially true because Homeworld 3 has the fewest types of Hiigaran ships to play with of the series, mostly due to the fact that there\u2019s only one type of corvette. It\u2019s certainly enough to get the job done, but feels a little thin when composing a fleet. Instead, frigates are the backbone of any group, and that\u2019s where the vast majority of the Hiigarans\u2019 variety and flexibility lies. You get to choose from straightforward assault frigates, long-range missile frigates, ion beam frigates, minelayer frigates, support (repair) frigates, and barrage (anti-fighter) frigates, and finding a balance between those is generally where the interesting decisions behind building a strike group arise."

Is it really new, or just the same old game with a fresh coat of paint? There\u2019s always a laundry list of flashy new marketing terms designed to grab attention: Hypermotion V, FC IQ, BallTouch, Rush, and so on (okay, one of those is made up). Yet, even with all the buzzwords, there\u2019s often a lingering feeling that these changes are merely surface-level, and this year is no different in that regard. A series of incremental improvements and adjustments do add to the fun through their novelty if nothing else, but they\u2019re hardly a sweeping revolution. While an exciting new mode like Rush can add an interesting twist, it\u2019s not enough to mask the fact that this is still very much a familiar experience, and for long-time fans like myself, the excitement is starting to wear pretty thin. Let\u2019s start with the new futsal-inspired mode, Rush, as it\u2019s the freshest thing about FC 25. Although it\u2019s technically a five-a-side mode, it\u2019s built with four outfield players in mind, with the goalkeeper controlled by the AI. It\u2019s available across all four core parts of FC 25\u2014Kick Off, Ultimate Team, Career, and Clubs\u2014making it perfect for people who don\u2019t always have a full squad but still want to jump into the action. For example, in Career Mode it\u2019s used in the introduction of youth tournaments, giving you a chance to test your wunderkinds in high-pressure scenarios throughout the season. It\u2019s a cool, fast-paced break from the standard matches and adds some much-needed variety to the often-repetitive nature of Career seasons. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Whether you\u2019re teaming up with friends or diving in solo, Rush brings a level of accessibility that\u2019s hard to resist. I found myself spending most of my time with it in Ultimate Team, using one of my stars alongside random teammates online. While there\u2019s no target beyond Rush points, and no league to climb, the mode still pulled me in emphatically. Rush uses unique rules that inject a welcome dose of chaos. Kick-offs are reimagined, with players racing toward the center of the pitch as the ball is launched into play\u2014reminiscent of Rocket League. Matches are fast-paced and concise, lasting just seven minutes followed by a short golden goal period if the scores are level at the end, with a tense, up-close penalty shootout afterward if still no one finds the net. The offside rule only applies in the final third, giving you more freedom in how you approach the goal. Red cards are replaced with blue cards, sending players to a one-minute sin bin for serious fouls\u2014though their time can be cut by 15 seconds for each goal the opposition scores while they're sidelined. There are also restrictions on the players you can use at the time of writing (Max 79-rated, untradeable), with this expected to be shaken up every so often. The new Rush mode is a fast and often high-scoring spectacle. \u201c All these adjustments make the new mode a fast and often high-scoring spectacle, with players darting across the sleek (and sponsored) Nike Air Zoom Arena. The neon-gilded stadium, modeled after Nike\u2019s Mercurial football boots, looks fantastic and the energetic atmosphere elevates the entire experience. The commentator, Fernando Palomo, is exceptional. While his insistence on screaming \u201cGOAAAAAL!\u201d 10 to 15 times a game will probably grate by the end of the season, I still love that the excitement is palpable from the first whistle. \"There's the ball, go get it!\" sets the tone for each match, and the hyperbolic passion for every opportunity keeps the energy alive. Plus, witnessing my tap-ins get hyped up and enshrined as a work of art never gets old. While Rush is best played at a relentless pace, if you're willing to slow things down and focus on defending, you can find immense satisfaction in marking up and shutting down attacks. Ironically, defending in Rush feels more rewarding than in traditional 11v11 modes. The smaller pitch creates a sense of openness that encourages tactical play and, overall, the mode feels more relaxed and enjoyable. My biggest question when playing is always \u201cWill my teammates actually bother to defend?\u201d Playing defensively in Rush feels like choosing to be a Medic in Battlefield\u2014it\u2019s not glamorous, but it\u2019s honest work. And when it clicks, it can make all the difference. What's more important to you in a sports game?

Answer See Results Right now, Rush stands out as the most innovative part of the Ultimate Team experience as well, especially in a year without major overhauls. While there are minor tweaks\u2014like the ability to stash up to 100 untradeable duplicates for squad-building challenges, and a more relaxed FUT Rivals friendlies mode decoupled from hardcore matchmaking\u2014the addition of Rush feels the most significant. Despite its simplicity, Rush is the mode I keep coming back to after a long day. It\u2019s pure fun, and ultimately, that\u2019s what matters most. Despite the lack of long-term objectives, I couldn\u2019t stop playing. It\u2019s compelling in all the right ways, and probably the best thing EA has added to the series in years. It's a seriously good time, and I hope it continues to get new content and attention to keep it fresh and thriving. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Graphically, EA Sports FC is once again a hot pot of good and bad, shining on the pitch while appearing neglected off it. During matches, the presentation is particularly sharp\u2014especially in Premier League games, where the new scoreboards, broadcast-style overlays, and team-specific on-screen graphics packages really stand out. A nice surprise is the option to re-enable team walkouts in the pre-match build-up after the feature was suddenly removed in FC 24. Unfortunately, the user interface is a different story. What\u2019s most infuriating is how the menus feel like they were designed for a touchscreen\u2014soft edges, clunky to navigate, and far from intuitive with a controller. Worse, they seem to provide less information than ever before. Despite the ever-increasing bloat of the menu items directly in front of you, key information is buried behind layers of tabs that disappear if you scroll too far, leaving you hunting for crucial options. FC 25 Screenshots 13 Images For a game that actively encourages you to slow down, tweak tactics, and customise player roles, the new menu system that plagues every game mode feels like it\u2019s chugging two steps behind my inputs, making what should be an enjoyable experience feel like a chore. This was especially notable in menu-heavy modes like Career which, while it has had several cool additions, is now aggravating to try and navigate through. There\u2019s also the new \u2018Cranium\u2019 system, which aims to make players without facial scans appear more natural alongside top-tier talent from the likes of the Premier League, La Liga, and beyond. It\u2019s nice to see a greater range of \u201cgeneric\u201d faces now, and even unscanned players look a little like their real-life counterparts. Likewise, it\u2019s neat that there\u2019s a greater level of customization in the personal player or manager models as well. However, the results are inconsistent: Under ideal conditions and lighting, some players look significantly better than in previous entries, but these conditions are rare, and more often than not everyone in FC 25 looks like they\u2019ve been pulled from a waxy, uncanny valley hell.\\ Speaking of jank, expect some of the typical weirdness in FC 25. \u201c Speaking of the jank, expect some of the typical weirdness in FC 25. Commentary is still often disconnected from the action on the pitch, Ultimate Team still likes to freeze on me at every opportunity, and cutscenes still glitch out in the most bizarre ways. For those of us who\u2019ve been around the FIFA/FC block, these graphical quirks are nothing new, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less annoying. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a similar story across many annual sports titles. In Madden, bizarre animation bugs still see players warping or phasing through each other, while NBA 2K has its own share of uncanny character models and awkward animations. It feels like these issues are simply glossed over with each new installment. In fact, they\u2019re becoming increasingly indefensible as the same problems resurface year after year. Tweaks That Matter (And Many That Don\u2019t) When it comes to the actual, on-field action, FC 25 delivers some fun, if incremental, improvements\u2014just like clockwork. One of the standout new features is FC IQ, which effectively replaces the old system of work rates, where players movement was dictated by set verbal descriptions of their effort in attack and defense. Instead, player movement is now determined by their \u201crole\u201d and the \u201cfocus\u201d assigned to them within that role. Each position offers a choice of three to five roles. For example, a central attacking midfielder (CAM) can be assigned roles like shadow striker, playmaker, and others, altering how forward-thinking you want them to be throughout a game. There\u2019s a new level of automation that goes hand-in-hand with this change and actually feels significant. For example, attackers are a bit more useful while on the break, and no longer having to constantly trigger players\u2019 runs in behind or down the wing with manual button presses is great. Players will make smarter runs based on their roles, too. However, the level of control still pales in comparison to the more tactical-heavy sims found in Football Manager, and the initial impressiveness of the change wears off fast. It\u2019s certainly an improvement, but the desired depth isn\u2019t quite there yet. The implementation of new player roles in Ultimate Team, evolving based on real-life performances, is also a neat touch\u2014for example, Bellingham playing deeper one week could see him re-emerge as a playmaker. What we said about EA Sports FC 24 If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA\u2019s soccer sim to go along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If you\u2019ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to improve its RPG elements, even if it\u2019s only currently for Ultimate Team where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions. Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again suffer from the same lack of care they\u2019ve been missing for years, with the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just about the same, frustrating but beautiful game. - Andrew McMahon, September 26, 2023 Score: 7 Read the full EA Sports FC 24 review . In terms of how the on-pitch action feels with the controller in your hand, passing is a touch snappier than last year, especially when pinging long balls across the pitch. Shooting also has a nice weight to it\u2014smooth, responsive, and satisfying. When the weather effects are in play in offline modes, even the physics in wet conditions adds a layer of unpredictability, with the ball sometimes skidding to a halt as the rain pours down. It\u2019s these moments when you\u2019re battling the elements that are a great example of the enjoyment found in the imperfections of the beautiful game. But then there\u2019s the defense, which still feels frustratingly loose. A tale as old as time, pacy players can turn and breeze past a defense with ease, and defenders are often a step behind, even slower than they should be. Near-track-athlete-level speedsters like Micky Van de Ven sometimes find themselves unable to catch up with the less-than-zippy attackers. If the opponent gets in behind your defense, you might as well start planning your next kickoff because there\u2019s little you can do to stop them. Defensive issues are compounded by the new FC IQ tactical options, which are supposed to give you more control over how your team plays, not quite extending to defenders how I\u2019d like. For example, there are no longer instructions to tell players to press heavily after losing the ball. Defending is half of football, yet it currently feels like an afterthought here that needed a lot more time in the oven. No matter if you\u2019re playing a low, medium, or high-aggression style, it just feels the same: slow, boring, and lacking tight control. At times, it felt like someone was holding onto my players' heels, keeping them back; When they finally did accelerate, it was rigid and unnatural, like they were moving along a predetermined path. Let Down By The Rest As someone who prefers the depth of Career Mode (I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours playing out multiple season-long campaigns over the years) over the microtransaction-driven Ultimate Team, I was excited to see that FC 25 finally gives it the attention it deserves and brings some meaningful updates. But the changes are still bittersweet. One of the biggest improvements this year is simply in the ways you can customize the experience. There\u2019s more flexibility in how you set up your career\u2014board expectations, for instance, can now be set to lenient, sparing you the frustration of being sacked for not spending every penny of your transfer budget. The ability to customize training plans and match tactics to a greater degree, deciding how hard your players train and which roles suit them best, is a welcome step towards giving us more control over our players\u2019 development, particularly when it comes to managing youth talent and squad rotation. Then there\u2019s also the addition of those weather effects like wind and rain, which genuinely affect how matches play out. In smaller stadiums, for example, a strong gust can make the ball swerve unpredictably. It\u2019s a satisfying touch and adds a new level of realism for offline modes like Career that feels long overdue. That said, it\u2019s a shame this isn\u2019t available in online modes. I understand how it could frustrate those who don\u2019t enjoy forces outside of their control becoming a deciding factor, but I\u2019d love to see it as an optional setting for casual Ultimate Team matchups, there to spice things up just that bit more for those of us who like to live dangerously. Beyond the weather, another interesting feature is the integration of a social media feed featuring none other than the seemingly omnipresent transfer guru Fabrizio Romano. His trademark \"Here We Go\" catchphrase now pops up during in-game transfer announcements. It\u2019s a fun, slightly gimmicky (and perhaps borderline cringeworthy) addition\u2014but I\u2019m still waiting for a \u201cThere We Land\u201d before I\u2019m truly impressed. FC 25\u2019s welcoming of several major women\u2019s leagues is long overdue and much appreciated, and the ability to seamlessly drift between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s leagues and teams within one career mode save is particularly neat. Plus, you can now start a save as one of FC\u2019s many icons, allowing me to finally live out my dream of Andrea Pirlo running the show at the base of Gillingham\u2019s midfield.

The clunky menus, which are inexplicably worse in Career, slow down even the simplest tasks. Whether it\u2019s searching for players or navigating tactics, the interface feels more cumbersome than ever. The expanded tactical roles, while great in theory, don\u2019t translate into the impactful gameplay changes you\u2019d expect, especially when your defenders feel a step behind the action. For a mode that should pride itself on its immersive simulation, these moments of inconsistency jar you back to reality. EA has clearly tried to modernize Career Mode with new features, but these efforts are undermined by how outdated and unintuitive the rest of the experience feels. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to love this mode\u2014it\u2019s where I\u2019ve always found the deepest connection to the series. Yet, it\u2019s hard to feel fully invested when these long-standing problems still exist. FC 25\u2019s Career Mode takes a step in the right direction with its new additions, but they aren\u2019t enough to overcome the inertia holding it back. After more than 20 years of playing EA Sports football titles, the cracks in this series are no longer subtle\u2014they\u2019re now threatening its foundation"

        "Content": "I fell in love with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time way back in 2003, when it helped redefine 3D action-adventure games with its clever rewind ability enhancing its environmental puzzles and fast, acrobatic combat. But while the aughts saw a bunch of sequels with similar elements, none ever quite hit the same heights as The Sands of Time \u2013 and the 2010s were a parched desert for the series. But like an oasis, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown finally nails what I loved about those classic Prince of Persia games, and it does so by placing the series' best ideas within a 2D Metroidvania framework that calls back to the roots of the 1989 original. The Lost Crown excels in both the elements that make for a great Prince of Persia: platforming and combat. The 3D games sometimes struggle with cameras that can be tough to wrangle in tight spaces or that make it difficult to gauge distances, and often solve the problem by just locking the camera in place in tricky spots. Combat has a similar problem: parkour-like fighting moves are always cool, but it can be tough to pull them off well, especially against multiple opponents. By bringing the whole game to a 2D viewpoint, The Lost Crown is able to hone in on precise, snappy controls that always feel great and you can always see exactly what you need to. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Gameplay Screenshots 13 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Like The Sands of Time and 2008's Prince of Persia reboot , The Lost Crown constitutes a reimagining of the series' concept, striking out in its own direction but maintaining some familiarity. The enticing basics are the same: As a quick, acrobatic protagonist, you explore a massive, semi-ruined location covered in deadly traps and filled with various soldiers and monsters you must overcome with strength and cunning, and time shenanigans are afoot. The similarities end there, though, as The Lost Crown tells a new story based in Persian mythology, leaning into an adventure filled with cool characters that are often pretty interesting, although the plot can get tripped up in its details and delivery as you explore the maze-like map. At the heart of the tale are the Immortals, a group of seven nearly superheroic warriors, dispatched to the legendary Mount Qaf to rescue the kidnapped prince of Persia, Ghassan. You play as Sargon, the youngest and most brash of the group, whose struggles both with proving his place among the Immortals and with chasing down his mentor, responsible for the kidnapping, make him a compelling character throughout the twisty, though somewhat predictable, journey. Sargon is a fierce, fast warrior, and while this is a Metroidvania and unlocking new abilities over time is an essential element of the formula, he's a capable fighter from the start. In fact, The Lost Crown's focus on giving you plenty of tools in combat right away is a huge part of why it works so well. Fighting enemies is as compelling as exploring the sprawling map thanks to combat that emphasizes speed, reaction time, and pressing your advantage. This combat system often moves at an almost breakneck pace. \u201c This combat system often moves at an almost breakneck pace. Sargon's speed is his greatest advantage, and even basic enemies hit hard enough that you need to take them seriously. It\u2019s a balance that creates situations where you always need to be reading enemy movements, and your best bet is usually to keep moving and keep attacking. The threat most enemies present kept every battle exciting and important across my 25 hours in Mount Qaf, even on the \"normal\" difficulty mode, and the fun comes from learning to master everything at your disposal. The Lost Crown sports four difficulty options, as well as the ability to customize things like enemy health and damage and parry window size, and combat is exciting enough that I'm looking forward to starting new runs on the tougher levels to put my skills to the test. One of The Lost Crown\u2019s best ideas is to increase its focus on melee action beyond what you might expect from a Metroidvania\u2019s combat system \u2014 almost Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice meets Devil May Cry . Your goal in fights is to create and maintain combos that can give you an advantage. Kicking smaller enemies into the air allows you to juggle them and keep them from fighting back, while the goal with larger enemies is usually to get behind their defenses to evade their blows while ravaging them with your own. In addition to regular strikes, upward and downward attacks, and aerial maneuvers, Sargon also has moves that chain off dodges and slides, and heavier attacks that can be charged up or change depending on when you execute them in a chain. You wind up with lots of different moves at your disposal that can be linked together in different ways depending on the situation and the enemy you're fighting. All of Sargon's attacks are simple and easy to execute, but still made him feel like a fierce warrior at all times, especially as I learned how to read opponents and pull off combos that allowed me to absolutely dominate them. What's your favorite part of 2D Metroidvanias? Expansive maps Finding secrets Fighting enemies Platforming challenges Unlocking new abilities Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results Adding to the thrill is the fact that combat is so damn stylish. Sargon and the other Immortals who appear as NPCs zip across battlefields at impossible speeds as bright colors splash over the background. You don't have a proper block, but you can parry some moves, and parrying specific, powerful attacks triggers a quick execution cutscene that eliminates regular enemies outright with flair, rewarding you for understanding your opponent and reacting quickly. Miss a parry, however, and you're left vulnerable; The Lost Crown will show you just how bad you messed up with a giant splash of red as you take your hit. Flashy sequences also mark Sargon's special Athra Surge abilities, which you'll unlock as you progress through the story and have to be charged up by damaging enemies. But when you jump through those hoops you\u2019ll be able to do things like throw several foes into the air at once, create a healing field, or fire a hugely powerful arrow. They all come with their own cool cutscene animations that emphasize the power you're unleashing. Never is combat better than in boss battles, though. All the same rules of regular battles apply, with attacks that can be parried and some that trigger counters to land a huge, cinematic hit. But bosses all have similar tools to your own, like unparryable moves that have to be dodged, and even their own Athra abilities that you have to learn and avoid. As with combat, platforming is consistently excellent. \u201c One boss trounced me again and again by using a counterattack ability that triggered when I hit him \u2014 not only did he turn my attack against me, but I got to be humiliated by a killer cutscene as he buried a kamehameha-like blast of energy in Sargon's chest. These moments come across like gods clashing as a result, and The Lost Crown's bosses having abilities similar to yours makes them feel like true contests of skill. The other half of The Lost Crown is its platforming gauntlet. As with combat, platforming is consistently excellent. In fact, your abilities are often so useful that you can work your way around obstacles with ingenuity rather than by unlocking a particular move. A few times, slipping under a ledge with a dash and linking that into a double jump, or carefully timing wall jumps, got me to places I didn't initially think I could reach. You can never perform quite so well that you wind up in places before you belong there (though I'm sure speedrunners will find a way to do just that), but there are a few times when being adept in platforming feels extra rewarding as you scale a mountain wall or across a deadly precipice. Most of the abilities you'll unlock while making your way through Mount Qaf will be familiar to Metroidvania fans \u2014 staples like a double-jump, a mid-air dash, and a grapple. In its platforming, The Lost Crown doesn't break the mold, but it does execute everything it attempts exceptionally well. Some really great, challenging level design will put you through your paces dodging swinging blades and avoiding spikes, and the obstacles you face never feel cheap or frustrating. The Lost Crown discards the time-rewinding power that defined most of the Prince of Persia games by allowing you to undo mistakes. Instead, when you fail during a platforming section, you're just returned to the last chunk of solid ground you touched with a little damage to your health bar. As long as you're not out of health, you're free to try again immediately. It isn't as thematically neat as the rewind feature, but it is functionally a quicker, cleaner approach to allowing you to adjust for your errors. It's rare that a platforming section feels too long or is annoying to repeat since you can make additional attempts almost instantly, and you only really suffer consequences when you fully run out of health. Mount Qaf itself is a big map with a lot of impressive areas, each with a different feel and slate of mechanics. Again, the ideas at play here aren't rewriting the Metroidvania playbook, but they serve very well to provide a lot of variety and interesting obstacles. Each has its own vibes, enemies, and ideas, like an underground pirate harbor filled with explosives and ambushes, and an academy area where keeping quiet is necessary to avoid a towering, overzealous, blind librarian. You'll revisit each location over and over again as you unlock new abilities that make additional areas accessible, and they're all different enough that return trips remain interesting even late in the campaign. The map photo system is something every Metroidvania should emulate. \u201c The Lost Crown also lets you snap a photo of a spot where you see something you can't currently reach or a puzzle you don't yet understand, which adds the image to your map.  It's a brilliant system that every Metroidvania should emulate. On more than one occasion, checking over photos I'd taken early on led to \"Eureka!\" moments \u2014 like one in which I realized the solution to a puzzle that involved a crushing wall required placing a statue into the trap. I finally got it only after carefully examining the background of the room, littered with smashed statues, and thanks to the photo marking the spot, it was trivial to quickly return there. The system encourages you to find and solve everything Mount Qaf has to offer, and cuts down on the irritating need to scour an area for something you may have missed. My favorite location was a sea battle frozen in time, where you can walk on waves mid-crash and see combatants flung by explosive cannon fire arrested in mid-air. As you progress, you eventually restart time for part of the area, forcing you to travel through the stormy battle even as other parts of the location are still frozen, creating a very cool effect. But it was elements like this sea battle that made me wish The Lost Crown leaned harder into its ideas about the broken flow of time, which is more something characters talk about than something that actually happens on screen. People will mention seeing different versions of the Immortals or even claim they've interacted with Sargon before you've met them, and these are some of The Lost Crown's most fascinating ideas \u2014 but it doesn't fully explore them. Phil Hornshaw Ranks Prince of Persia Games Looking at the Prince of Persia games and figuring out how much better each one is than Warrior Within. See All 1 Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Ubisoft Montreal 2 Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Ubisoft Montpellier 3 Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Ubisoft Montreal 4 Prince of Persia Ubisoft Montreal 5 Prince of Persia [1989] Broderbund 6 Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands Ubisoft Montreal 7 Prince of Persia: Warrior Within Ubisoft Montreal That was a problem throughout the story, in fact. At points, I felt like I had missed things; after a particularly wonky bit of time-rearranging, Sargon keeps asking characters if they remember meeting him, as if he'd run into someone who had forgotten him because of the altered timeline. But if that person existed, I never found them, and nobody ever acted like time's shifts had stolen their memory of what I\u2019d experienced. The same is true of one of The Lost Crown\u2019s side characters, who disappeared at one point never to be seen again, and I had one minor side quest that never seemed to advance correctly. Additionally, the relatively open, interconnected world of Mount Qaf sometimes plays against the story that takes place within it, where taking a certain path can cause you to miss events or reach them slightly out of order, which might have been interesting if this was a deliberate effect of the time-twisting story, but instead just makes things feel a bit jumbled and perplexing. The Lost Crown leaves parts of its story untold or confusing. \u201c Even after I finished, the whole tale seemed to have a few lingering plot holes. It might be that part of the story is locked behind the biggest and most arduous side quest, or it could be that the many collectible lore items are meant to fill in the gaps. But unless you attempt to get reasonably close to 100-percent completion, The Lost Crown leaves parts of its story untold and, as a result, other parts are confusing. As much as I liked the characters throughout, its conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying due to what seemed like missing pieces. And while the voice acting for the main cast is strong throughout, there's one minor character where the quality is noticeably worse. It turns out that's because this character isn't voiced by an actor at all, but by a free text-to-speech program you may have already heard reading out Twitch donations at one time or another. Ubisoft has said this was a placeholder left in by mistake , and it expects an update with a human voice to arrive by early next month, but it won\u2019t be in the planned day one patch. The artificial voice isn\u2019t bad enough to actively detract from that section \u2014 we're talking about a character who only has a small handful of voice lines and who you'll see maybe twice in 20 hours \u2014 but it\u2019s still pretty embarrassing."

We do not recommend it on those platforms at this time. In my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn\u2019t without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves \u2013 optional or not \u2013 and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I\u2019ve played in recent years. You\u2019re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass \u2013 even if, to be blunt, Reeves\u2019 stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny\u2019s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Patches Since Launch Updated 2/4/21 Since publishing this review, CD Projekt Red has released multiple patches attempting to improve the performance of Cyberpunk 2077 and fix bugs. Multiple smaller updates were released closer to release, including the 1.06 patch we took a deep look at hare , with the larger 1.1 patch arriving more recently . Additionally, CDPR stated that next-gen versions are aimed for release in the second half of 2021. It\u2019s worth noting that the 1.1 update inadvertently introduced a different game breaking bug that quickly needed to be patched out as well, so while improvements are certainly being made issues haven\u2019t gone entirely gone away. You can find a full 1.1 performance analysis here for an in-depth look at how these patches have changed the state of Cyberpunk 2077 at the time of this update. Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s slow burn of an intro \u2013 it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time \u2013 I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V\u2019s struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City ; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no one\u2019s going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble \u2013 and from the early hours you\u2019ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time. The structure here feels very different from many RPGs I\u2019ve played, including CD Projekt Red\u2019s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you don\u2019t have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often don\u2019t even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there\u2019s so much to see and do \u2013 and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out \u2013 that I didn\u2019t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice. The intro did an incredible job of getting me invested in V and Johnny\u2019s struggle. \u201c And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won\u2019t get that \u201cwow\u201d feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it \u2013 for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered there\u2019s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. You\u2019ll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer \u2013 from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them \u2013 is frequently rewarding on its own. Cyberpunk 2077 PC Gameplay Screenshots 42 Images In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means you\u2019ll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There\u2019s some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you\u2019re constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I won\u2019t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions. Divergent Paths Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly you\u2019ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don\u2019t let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. It\u2019s frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make \u2013 choice in dialogue options, how to build your character , how to approach missions, and beyond. I\u2019d frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if I\u2019d done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both V\u2019s own story and those of the characters around them. At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone else\u2019s game where they\u2019d picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn\u2019t even offered to another player because of a single decision we\u2019d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I\u2019d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation. Don\u2019t let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and through. \u201c The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark . I don\u2019t want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like \u201cMILFguard\u201d (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher\u2019s Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in. The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPR\u2019s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one) \u2013 and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you\u2019ll get in the end. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a Rorschach Test. \u201c This is the crux of what\u2019s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It\u2019s not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: it\u2019s a Rorschach Test. It\u2019s shorter than the epic-length quest you might\u2019ve expected, but with an amount of variation that\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what you\u2019re going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player. That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it\u2019s organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny\u2019s story than others. It\u2019s primarily broken into \u201c Main Jobs \u201d that are required to progress, \u201cGigs\u201d that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a \u201c Side Jobs \u201d category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What\u2019s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings. Does hearing Cyberpunk 2077 can be \"beaten\" in about 20 hours make you more or less interested in playing? More Less No change Answer See Results Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of V\u2019s journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that. Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times \u2013 like you\u2019re playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V\u2019s journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of V\u2019s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural. Blade Gunner While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn\u2019t any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes , and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if you\u2019re planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (I\u2019m not sure why, but let\u2019s just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown. Every CD Projekt Red Review 13 Images What\u2019s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you can\u2019t bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you don\u2019t invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use \u2013 so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize you\u2019re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you\u2019ve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have. Combat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete control over the choreography. \u201c Combat itself is another aspect where you\u2019ll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn\u2019t in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting. What's the Deal With PS5 and Series X Versions? I've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year. I wouldn\u2019t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It\u2019s not the most complex dance in the world, but it\u2019s one I felt I had complete control over choreographing. I also love Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot \u2013 things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or\u2026 a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff . The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in V\u2019s apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use \u2013 though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons I\u2019ve found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap. The soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially stands out. \u201c Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn\u2019t much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way. What's more important to an open-world RPG? A great main quest Great side quests Answer See Results Quickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my V\u2019s high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out. When things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone. Bugs in the System Unfortunately, the amount of bugs I\u2019ve experienced really does need to be mentioned. I\u2019ve only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues I\u2019ve encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as you\u2019d hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions \u2013 but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me. I\u2019ve had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. I\u2019d frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. I\u2019ve had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful. Cyberpunk 2077 - Examples of Visual Bugs 9 Images A day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance \u2013 which is always good, but frankly those aren\u2019t the issues that\u2019ve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today. Just to restate, a word of warning: we haven\u2019t been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all \u2013 not on the new-gen systems or the old. While I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues I\u2019ve seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what it\u2019ll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If that\u2019s where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision.

        "Content": "With Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down. Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of the series yet \u2013 but stand the original alongside this sequel in other ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each other. The excellent combat hasn\u2019t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others. Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2\u2019s combat is very familiar \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have that new suit smell anymore, but it still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision dodges, the new perfect parries (so you\u2019re not only swerving and striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling pins \u2013 but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to commit crimes again. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Overall, there\u2019s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine, this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than spreading them out to pick them off one by one. A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber \u2013 which pulls enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another \u2013 also playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this before landing a sharp burst of Miles\u2019 Venom lightning onto grouped-up goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match Miles\u2019 satisfying electric abilities. They\u2019re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar \u2013 filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges \u2013 and is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost. Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety. \u201c One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you\u2019ll no longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats. New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes. Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle to fights. It\u2019s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added level of complexity that makes you consider which powers \u2013 or even which Spider-Man \u2013 are best for a given job. That's not to say there aren\u2019t benefits to taking a sneaky route, though, especially when you\u2019re playing as Miles and using his invisibility power to quietly take out enemies. There are many perch takedown possibilities offered and new toys to play with too, such as the Web Line, which allows you to create your own highwires over your enemies to prey on them from above. It\u2019s a fun tool that allows you to reshape the tightly designed arenas into a battlefield more in your favour, and in doing so, redecorate the room with web-wrapped people pi\u00f1atas. On the other hand, much like combat, stealth isn\u2019t a far cry from the many warehouse encounters you\u2019ll have played in the previous games, as you clear out enemies using largely the same techniques. Performance Review - Fidelity Mode Vs Performance Mode on PS5 Spider-Man 2 is, on paper, the perfect sequel. It takes all of the elements that made the first games so much fun and builds and improves on them. Bigger battles, improved ray tracing, wider story choices, more flamboyant combat, dual characters, improved visuals, staggeringly fast and dense city travel are all excellent. The sheer wow factor it delivers will impress, but some of the shine is dulled by comparison to Insomniacs own previous success and work on the remasters of the original and Miles Morales for PS5. Going from the original PS4 or even PS4 Pro Spider-Man games to this is a night-and-day difference in almost all areas, with the most noticeable being seamless loading, ray tracing, AI muscle deformation, vast performance increases and visuals that push the PS5 hard. But from the PlayStation 5 updates, the leap is smaller, if still impressive. None of this diminishes the excellent, varied and amazing game within, but just how amazing that is depends on when you last slipped into the tights of New York\u2019s favourite web head. \u2013 Michael Thompson, October 16, 2023 Read the full Spider-Man 2 Performance Review On the topic of covert ops, the playable MJ sequences from the original return, and while they are more involved this time around and serve the story well, they never add up to more than simple stealth missions or splashes of basic third-person shooting. She\u2019s certainly not sidelined, but it does feel like a little more could\u2019ve been done to make her gameplay sections a bit more exciting \u2013 or at least more in line with her established character as an intrepid investigative reporter than the missions she\u2019s sent out on here. Combat aside, our Spider-Men can now swing around their friendly neighborhoods in more stylish ways than ever, with new spins and flips added to the repertoire providing a Tony Hawk-like edge. Performing web acrobatics is as gratifying as you remember, and still one of the best ways to get around any open world. The new web wings are undoubtedly a standout, however: like Batman before him, Spider-Man can now glide and soar with ease through the city, but not without limits \u2013 you\u2019ll need to get the hang of managing your altitude and forward momentum, with the aid of windy corridors through the city that can quickly carry you from one district to the next.

Answer See Results The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. \u201c The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. It's undeniably a fun time to don the suit and enter a Kratos-like rage mode where you push in both thumbsticks and start one-hitting everything in your path, but the writers never once forget to take their eyes off of the humanity inside these superhumans. The same can be said for both its heroes and villains, as Spider-Man 2 tackles the reasoning behind each character's actions and the good that can hide in the shadows of evil. For those with a hazy memory, there is a brief recap of both Peter and Miles\u2019 stories so far available, which is handy, as this is very much a sequel that weaves in both plotlines and characters from the previous games and accompanying DLC. You won\u2019t want to jump in for the first time here since Spider-Man 2 builds on the first two games both in its mechanics and its story \u2013 but of course, there\u2019s little reason not to, since those games are also excellent. Avoiding spoilers, the basic premise revolves around Kraven the Hunter, who is, well, craving a hunt. For those uninitiated in the character, he's essentially The Predator, an Apex hunter blessed with super strength who has chosen New York as his next hunting ground. It's a great starting point that sends the city's hero and villain dynamic into flux as he sets his sights on the biggest prey possible.

Both Spider-Men tackle the most extreme examples of trying to manage a work/life balance you can imagine, exploring a range of personal issues including strained relationships and loss that plague us as humans, no matter how superpowered we may feel. It's the best-written story in the series yet (if still a bit cheesy at times), with performances worthy of the script. It\u2019s a real triumph that it manages to cover such a wide spectrum of themes without suffering from tonal thwip-lash. A particularly memorable mission under the dancing lights of Coney Island\u2019s amusement rides is a highlight that manages to impressively capture the story\u2019s essence and bottle up its emotional tension before emphatically smashing it. Primarily a Peter Parker story, Spider-Man 2 explores his relationship with MJ and the reintroduction of childhood best friend Harry Osborne into his life. It\u2019s always compelling to watch him contend with which pieces of the past to leave behind and what future self he wishes to be. In some of the missions where you control normal, everyday Peter, I couldn't help but feel the Uncharted influence more than ever, both in the techniques it uses to tell his story and the show-stopping action sequences when he slips into the suit. No matter how hectic a scenario gets, though, he always has a quippy one-liner ready to be expertly delivered by actor Yuri Lowenthal. It's the best-written story in the series yet, with performances worthy of the script. \u201c Miles still gets his time in the spotlight, however, and has some fantastic moments towards the end of the main campaign, even if some of the more interesting explorations of his Puerto Rican/African American culture are reserved for side missions. Obviously, what you take away from the story and its diverse cast of characters will be unique to you. On the surface, it's another thrilling superhero story packed full of surprises, cameos, and Easter eggs \u2013 but there are deeper meanings to be found here, too. Spider-Man 2, and to an extent all great Spider-Man stories, tackle themes of adolescence and puberty \u2013 a time of uncertainty for even the most normal of teenagers trying to control bodily fluids. We join Miles at this exact point in his life, with family ties straining, friendships facing fresh challenges, and life decisions of genuine importance being posed for the first time. Actor Nadji Jeter displays all the range needed for the role, continuing to excel as a younger Spider-Man maturing before our eyes. For Peter, these themes manifest in a much more physical sense. He's in his early twenties so has already navigated the difficult years that Miles finds himself in, but thanks to the symbiote suit, he's working his way through yet more bodily changes. This physical manifestation is also representative of mental health issues that have developed for each Spider-Man. Venom hangs over the main characters like a spectre of grief, drenching them in black as if in a state of mourning. The story does a great job at gently exploring these issues and how, when not healthily addressed, personal demons can eat at us and lead to people we care about being unintentionally caught in the crossfire of the anger and pain those feelings can produce. Of course, a hero is nothing without its villains, and Spider-Man's rogues gallery is almost unparalleled. Outside of the likes of Venom, Kraven, and Lizard seen in the trailers, Insomniac has kept many more cards hidden up its sleeve. I won't even hint at any of these except to say that Spider-Man 2 opens with a bang, offering up a sense of scale not previously seen in the series. It's an adrenaline-fuelled reintroduction to the series that tests how well you remember the combat, as well as providing a few new tricks. It's also the start of one of the new side-story villain threads that are optional, and while those don't offer anything overly new in terms of gameplay, they do add valuable extra scraps of story. They flesh out these villains, allowing fully formed characters to emerge where once they were merely one-and-done boss battle appearances. A tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. \u201c Speaking of boss battles, that\u2019s one area that takes a noticeable step up from our initial tangos with Kingpin, Vulture, and the rest. One of my criticisms of the first in Insomniac's series was how uninspired many of the showdowns felt, with their quicktime-heavy fights making a light impact. Improvements were made in Miles Morales, but here in the full-fledged sequel, boss battles really come to life. You're made to wait a little too long for them sometimes, but when they do arrive they never fail to excite. They are evolving brawls packed full of danger that put all of your skills to the test. Dodges and parries are key, as well as using environmental tools dotted around the arenas for your benefit. The latter third of the campaign essentially becomes a boss rush mode that will put the sturdiest of thumbs to the test \u2013 not necessarily because it ever gets too difficult, but because of the sheer number of times you\u2019ll be hammering that Square button. These later stages are where the majority of Spider-Man 2\u2019s thrills lay, however, as it really hits its stride late on, and emphatically wraps up a tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. Spider-Man 2 Rogues Gallery 6 Images The main story took me around 18 hours to complete before I hit 100%, and the subsequent platinum trophy popped up to congratulate my efforts after 27 in total. To earn that precious trophy, you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time mopping up the many, many side activities that Spider-Man 2 throws your way \u2013 and while not everybody must or should do all of that, it\u2019s a reminder that quantity doesn\u2019t always equal quality. Despite whatever loftier ambitions the story may have, this is still unapologetically an old-school approach to open-world game design, and nowhere is this displayed more clearly than in its optional quests. To their credit, the way you can highlight side objectives by pressing the right stick is a welcome upgrade over mere icons on a map. Even without that, you can spot ominous clouds or glowing purple rooftops with the bare eye signaling activities are there to be found. This isn't a world that beckons exploration or discovery, necessarily, but it is a step in the right direction toward creating greater immersion and mercifully less time spent looking at the map screen. It\u2019s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac\u2019s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content \u201c That being said, I can't help but have hoped for a few more flashes of Gotham City to make their way into New York. Something like the spontaneous shock of Manbat jumping at you out of nowhere went a long way to making Rocksteady's superhero open world feel more reactive than what we get here (even though it always cheated by finding ways to keep civilians off the streets). When you consider the evolution of open-world game design that the Arkham series took over the course of the trilogy, and its multilayered villain side quests, it\u2019s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac\u2019s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content and the way it presents itself to you. Standard open-world filler activities are here aplenty, and that\u2019s one area where Spider-Man 2 hasn't moved with the times or shown ambition at all. Collectibles, photo opportunities, and rather basic street crimes are still here and, despite having a few slightly more interesting quirks this time around, they only very occasionally excite. You\u2019ll regularly be stopping the same getaways with the same few button presses (the button-mashing from previous games is mercifully largely gone) or stopping a break-in by battering the same few goons. Granted, the additional enemy variety in play makes these activities take a little longer to get old than they did in the past, but that still isn't quite a strong enough twist to make prioritising photographing a couple of amateur cosplayers over saving a house full of people from a raging fire not seem ridiculous. Fun, quick side missions like helping a student ask their crush to homecoming or rescuing the Brooklyn Visions\u2019 mascot from a rival school by solving a series of light and mirror puzzles add dashes of charm, but I'd love to see yet more life breathed into this world to match its visual splendor. These characters do add a bit more flavour to the world and its largely homogenous population of NPCs you\u2019re clearly not intended to look at too closely. There are exceptions to the rule, however: there are a couple of more involved questlines that are much more nourishing, almost to the point of being a series of mini main plot missions. My favourite was The Flame questline, which begins with simply helping out the fire brigade, but quickly spins a layered and mysterious web. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises, like a great, short comic book run that separates itself from the rest of Spider-Man 2\u2019s optional time trials and simple puzzle minigames. Rewards for completing these various activities vary, with some ranging from genuinely exciting story teases for what\u2019s to come, to simply gaining some tech parts to upgrade your abilities with. The tasks are often so mundane and repetitive, however, that I did frequently question whether these small, congratulatory nuggets were worth the slog they too often turned out to be. Top 10 Spider-Man Games 11 Images All of this contributes to fighting back against crime in each district of New York, a city now twice the size of what we\u2019ve seen before including the leafy residential roads of Queens and the bustling borough of Brooklyn. There are 14 unique districts, each with its own set of objectives to complete before you can unlock fast travel to that part of the map. Not making fast travel readily available is smart, and truthfully, I barely used it anyway as swinging and gliding around the city is so much more fun, even though the load times are nonexistent and the speedy, swooping camera effect of switching between Peter and Miles is very cool. Gliding is especially great for crossing long distances thanks to the numerous wind tunnels that carve their way through New York's seemingly endless grid of streets flanked by art deco architecture and modern mirror-like skyscrapers. Of course, if you\u2019re going to be catching your ray-traced, 4K reflection (if you opt for the 30fps fidelity mode) in that glass so often, you\u2019ll want to look your best. Fear not, because there are dozens and dozens of suits to unlock, with myriad colorful skins to pick from on each of them. From modern interpretations of classics to returning fan favourites, there are treats waiting for Spider-Man fans of all generations. They are now all pure cosmetics as well \u2013 a smart separation of form and function means picking the skills and abilities you equip are separate from your choice of suit. In keeping with Insomniac\u2019s track record, the music behind it all is stellar. \u201c In keeping with Insomniac\u2019s track record, the music behind it all is stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my playthrough. In fact, Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel as a whole. From the near-instant load times, the ability to pinpoint a fast-travel location and be there in a second, atmospheric lighting, and crisp reflections, all of the pieces fit into place wonderfully \u2013 aside from the very occasional NPC getting stuck where they shouldn\u2019t. I can't say that I noticed one dropped frame in my dozens of hours of playing. This allows Spider-Man 2 to shine in its most jaw-dropping moments \u2013 of which the main story offers many \u2013 as explosive action, sparkling electrical effects, and fittingly slimy symbiote gloop fill the screen."
