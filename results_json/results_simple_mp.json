        "Content": "NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 does a solid job making 2v2 arcade basketball fun for the long haul. Expanding on its predecessor, this sequel \u2013 now under the NBA 2K umbrella \u2013 includes two new major modes that enhance both the solo and multiplayer experiences. While the core gameplay feels very similar to NBA Playgrounds, that\u2019s mostly a good thing. Playgrounds 2 still lacks the depth of the defunct NBA Street series and the pure chaos of the also-dormant NBA Jam, but it has found its footing as a unique take on arcade basketball in its own right.  On the single-player side of the equation, Playgrounds 2 features a season mode, which replaces the six tournaments seen in the original. This isn\u2019t a full-fledged 82-game haul, however. Instead, each season consists of 14 regular season games and a best-of-three playoff format for the top eight teams from each conference. The truncated schedule works well here. You can finish an entire season in under a couple hours with the default game length of three minutes. It\u2019s a refreshing change of pace from the long slog of sports sim seasons. It also gives you the option to play the season cooperatively with a friend via couch co-op or online. Of note, season mode has four difficulty levels, and the AI feels smarter in the sequel, especially when ratcheting up the difficulty.   The season mode directly ties into the card collecting progression system, which makes its return from the original. Winning the championship with each team unlocks a legend. For instance, hoisting the trophy with the Lakers gives you access to Magic Johnson while prevailing with the Cavs gives you Mark Price. Legends often have unique animations that add flair to an already stylish experience.I found myself interested in the season loop even after I won the title with multiple teams. It\u2019s also a good way to level up cards that increase player stats. Currently, I have ongoing seasons with the Celtics, Nuggets, and 76ers. Although it doesn\u2019t really hurt the experience, it\u2019s slightly annoying that you are limited to three save slots and have to delete previous seasons once you fill up all three.  You can spend real money to unlock the whole player collection at once, but, unlike the original, it doesn\u2019t feel necessary. \u201c  Like the original, you have to open card packs to acquire new players. This means that many teams will be inaccessible at first simply due to the fact you won\u2019t have any of their players. Thankfully, you earn enough in-game currency to buy new packs at a fairly fast clip. After each run through a season, I had enough to purchase several packs, each of which contains four players. It also helps that opening duplicate cards doesn\u2019t seem to happen nearly as often in Playgrounds 2. I\u2019ve opened about 20 packs so far, and I\u2019ve only come across two duplicates. You can spend real money to unlock the whole collection at once, but, unlike the original, this doesn\u2019t feel necessary.  Playgrounds 2 has a great mix of current NBA players and legends. It appears that the 2K publishing deal has helped in the legends department as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and numerous other Hall of Fame caliber players are featured in Playgrounds 2. Jordan even has his legendary from the free throw line dunk. Not all teams are evenly represented though. For example, the Lakers have 14 possible cards while the Bulls have nine, the Clippers have seven, and the Wizards have eight. There are several active players on the wrong team. DeMarcus Cousins is on the Pelicans (one of only five Pelicans players by the way), Tony Parker is on the Spurs, Nick Young is on the Warriors, and Isaiah Thomas is on the Lakers.  NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 Screenshots 9 Images  The beefed-up online mode could give Playgrounds 2 some competitive legs if the community is active. Dubbed Playgrounds Championship, it\u2019s ranked play complete with multiple modes, leaderboards, and advanced stats. You can play competitive matches with either a CPU or online teammate (via friend list or matchmaking), or cooperative matches against the CPU with an online teammate. It\u2019s a more expansive online mode than the original and the rankings system could keep you online longer. Though I was only able to find a couple online matches for this review, everything ran smoothly, and I can see myself getting hooked from the rankings system and leaderboards. You can also play the three-point contest in Playgrounds Championship. The contest still feels like a throwaway mode, but at least it does help you work on timing your shots.  It\u2019s easy to grab a controller and score some buckets, but if you want to win on a consistent basis, you have to have skills. \u201c  On the court, Playgrounds 2 cleans up the arcade gameplay a tad, but it plays incredibly similar to the original. The shooting meter has changed from a bar to a semi-circle, though the concept of stopping the timer in the green remains the same. It\u2019s still a challenge to make three-pointers on a consistent basis with low-level players, even for those known for their sharpshooting. If you land outside of the green, it\u2019s an automatic miss. While somewhat unforgiving for an arcade basketball game, it\u2019s also what makes Playgrounds 2 unique. Yes, it\u2019s easy to grab a controller and score some buckets, but if you want to win on a consistent basis, you have to have skills.  Crossover moves are elaborate and over-the-top (cartwheels!) and vary based on player. Dunk and layup animations, the stars of the original, are still ridiculously cool. Even after the twentieth time watching Kevin Love slam home an alley-oop and proceed to do a backflip off the rim, I smiled. It doesn\u2019t take much skill to make your players perform crazy off the glass dunks, but it still feels satisfying nonetheless.   Defense feels a bit more balanced. I had an easier time blocking shots and snagging rebounds than I did in the original. Importantly, the shove button, which still drains your power-up meter, doesn\u2019t feel as cheap. Shoving a ball handler often pries the rock away from their hands, but unless your teammate is right by you, it\u2019s not a sure turnover. On the other hand, swiping at the ball feels more effective, if you time it up right against crossover moves.  The Lottery Picks meter is now represented by a basketball on each of the bottom corners of the screen. Once it\u2019s filled with glowing energy, you get a special ability for a temporary period. The nine boosts include multipliers for dunks and three-point shots, unlimited sprint, and super strength. New to Playgrounds 2 are power-ups that hurt the opposing team. You can inflict a curse on them that lowers their shooting percentage or a sheet of ice that covers the basket so they can\u2019t score. There\u2019s also a change to the lightning power-up. This time, in a nod to NBA Jam, the ball catches on fire, and yes, you will automatically make a full court shot with the fireball. Power-ups can change the momentum of a contest dramatically, but they very rarely feel cheap. Rather, they add an element of unpredictability that makes each trip to the blacktop exciting."

        "Content": "The original Bubble Bobble, released in arcades in 1986 with a popular NES version ported in 1988, was a lighthearted, coop action game that proved especially popular with casual gamers.  The gameplay was on the simpler side, but working with a friend to capture monsters in bubbles and send them popping (along with some great examples of Engrish: \"Let's make a journey to the cave of monsters!\") proved to be a charming experience.  Apparently, the people at Codemasters hate this game, as they've gone a long way towards destroying what made Bubble Bobble enjoyable in the first place.   Bubble Bobble Evolution features two characters named Bub and Bob who blow bubbles -- but that's about where the similarities to Bubble Bobble end.  Instead of dinosaurs, the friends have been replaced with boys in dinosaur costumes.  And instead of depicting the duo's \"journey to a cave of monsters,\" Evolution is set in 18th century London.  Bub and Bob are outside playing when they find themselves suddenly transformed from normal little boys into little boys wearing dinosaur costumes.  They are then separated and dropped into two towers where a mysterious voice tells them to enjoy the entertainment.  From there the two will have to work their way up to the top of the towers and confront their captor.   The levels of Bubble Bobble Evolution rotate as you move from room to room. Gone is the simplistic goal of the original Bubble Bobble: capture all the enemies in bubbles, pop them all, and proceed to the next screen.  Evolution clumsily switches the focus to flipping switches and transporting items from room to room.  Each floor of the tower is divided into three sections, and you'll have to solve little puzzles in each of the sections in order to open the elevator and advance to the next floor.  As you move between rooms, the floor rotates in 3D which, admittedly, is a nice visual effect.  But unlocking the elevator usually requires mundane tasks like flipping a switch in one room, proceeding to the next to find an item, then transporting the item in a bubble to the third room.  There are three types of switches (metal, stone, and wood), and they all perform different functions.  But telling the metal and stone switches apart is next to impossible and the game doesn't always notify you what the switch has altered in the environment.  So you'll often find yourself flipping a switch, then wandering around aimlessly wondering what it was you just did and what you need to do next.  On top of the often vague level objectives, the game also drops you into rooms that are blacked out and require you to search around in the dark for the light switch (all the while enemies are attacking and, probably, killing you).   This is not the Bubble Bobble you remember. Control is a simple matter of jumping (X button) and blowing bubbles (square button), with special bubbles you will rarely used mapped to the triangle and circle buttons.  You can switch between your two characters with a tap of the L button, or all of these controls can be customized in the options menu.  As Bub and Bob are in separate towers, you'll need to navigate them both to the top of their respective prisons.  But where this could have provided for some inventive play mechanics requiring players to switch back and forth between the towers and play the two characters off of each other, one boy's progress is actually unrelated to the other.  After every few floors you'll encounter a boss which is impressive in size but only has one canned animation it repeats over and over.  And defeating them rarely requires more than standing in place and blowing a stream of bubbles.  Other enemies scattered around the game are returning characters from previous Bobbles, like Zenchan the robot and Baneboh the ghost.  When defeated, they'll drop items that contribute to your score (which does nothing) or power-ups that increase things like your speed and bubble distance.  The power-ups are cumulative, which is nice, so you at least feel like your skills are improving as you make your way up the tower.  As with so many PSP games, load times for Bubble Bobble Evolution are atrocious.  Nothing will make you yearn for the instant gratification of the original game more than waiting a minute for your game to load, finding the game saved right before you entered an elevator, then waiting another minute for the next floor to load.  On top of that, the game's built-in tips take time to load.  So in the early stages, you'll flip a switch and the game will freeze for a few seconds -- finally, your tip will pop up, but then you'll have to wait a few seconds to get back into the game.  But here's where Codemasters really dropped the ball: Bubble Bobble Evolution does not feature any coop multiplayer.  What was probably the strongest selling point of the original game has been ignored in this update.  A competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players is included, but it is a shallow elimination game where you simply shoot \"bubble bombs\" at your opponents.   The music in the game is reminiscent of a carnival with a fun house version of the classic Bubble Bobble theme included.  Each tune should have been a few phrases longer, though, as you'll find they quickly begin to sound repetitious and, ultimately, annoying.  The graphics utilize 3D objects on a 2D plane, and the game starts out looking promising with bright colors and lively environments.  As you progress up the towers, though, you'll make your way through darker areas that, while they add variety, don't really suit the lighthearted Bubble Bobble world."

        "Content": "Watch a match of #IDARB, a 2D competitive multiplayer game for Xbox One, and nobody would blame you for feeling bewildered. It\u2019s fast-paced, chaotic, and often incomprehensible, but the winning team didn\u2019t get to the top of the leaderboard by chance. Part combo-based arcade game, part hockey, part basketball, and part Super Smash Bros., #IDARB is an intelligent, technical, and highly enjoyable little eSport. Just make sure you have a good number of players, or your teams will end up lopsided, bored, or both. #IDARB moves fast, and with two teams of two, matches are chaotic and ripe with opportunity for memorable plays. With four players on each team, #IDARB is borderline impossible to keep up with -- which makes playmakers feel all the better when a plan comes together. Setting up those big moments earns teams more points, too, and that\u2019s the hook. Accuracy and precision takes skill, since you both move and aim with the left stick, and firing off a high-speed shot (or missing a pass) could cause the ball to bounce off the edges of the opponents\u2019 net and back into your defensive zone. Everything about #IDARB relies on your reflexive, instant reactions to always-unpredictable events. Scoring is hard, but because #IDARB is so responsive and skill-centric, it makes getting a goal all the more rewarding -- and it gets even better as the player count increases. Passing the ball to an airborne ally creates a combo multiplier that pays off with more points when they score, particularly if they\u2019re farther away from the goal -- the farther you are, the more points you earn. The satisfaction of having a risky play send your score soaring over an opponent\u2019s keeps both teams striving to make big moves. When a massive play failed, our room full of local players burst into hysterical screaming -- one side relieved, the other horrified, both ecstatic for their next opportunity. A team of two is enough to get in position, pass the ball between players, and score goals by throwing the ball into a blocky net. Skilled players reveal themselves when intercepting passes and setting up alley-oop shots. Causing turnovers by blasting the offender with a burst of energy is essential as well; it disjoints possession, sending the ball loose into the multi-tiered playing field. Erratic shifts in who\u2019s carrying the ball causes frantic communication in teams who play to win, which is simultaneously part of what makes #IDARB entertaining, and why it\u2019s smart. Clearly explaining where you are, when you\u2019re available for a pass, and what you\u2019re planning, is challenging but crucial. Helpful visual language, like the line popping out of players calling for passes, give ball-carriers information amid the babbling chaos of their couch competitors. And #IDARB is at its most enjoyable with a large competitive couch crew -- online multiplayer works, but I ran into persistent and significant problems. Most notably, it suffers from inconsistent latency issues that made each match a crap-shoot in performance; one would run smoothly, while the next had an unbearable frame rate that destroys the split-second timing that makes #IDARB a great game. Also, when playing alone at home, you can\u2019t queue into a multiplayer game with custom settings -- playing alone means playing 1v1. Playing with one local pal means queuing into a 2v2, etc. #IDARB\u2019s online multiplayer is neutered by an absence of matchmaking options, and I constantly wished I could jump into a four- or eight-player match when I didn\u2019t have guests. This extends to local play somewhat as well. If you have, say, three or five players, the teams end up uneven, and there\u2019s no way to fill the spot with an online player or A.I. bot -- and unbalanced teams led to one unhappy team every time. Customization options are excellent, though. If you\u2019re all-in on #IDARB, you can create your own character sprites using a simple sprite editor. It\u2019s too small to allow for much sophistication, but it was enough to use that I could recreate my favorite Dota 2 Heroes, and recognize dozens of the pre-made Halo, The Walking Dead, Super TIME Force, and suspiciously Disney Princess-esque characters. Using your sprites, or the included ones, you can create teams for tournaments, as well as give them their own intro music using #IDARB\u2019s easy-to-use and surprisingly great music tool. I spent a couple hours composing little themes, messing with drum rhythms, bass lines, and goofy sound effects, and found the editor fun to use because it\u2019s simple without sacrificing depth. It only allows for four instrument layers, but it was sufficient enough for my musician coworkers to create awesome compositions."

        "Content": "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the reason I play video games. From the smile plastered on my face during the opening montage to the disbelief that swept over me as Chapter 2 began to the middle of the night text message I shot a friend about a relationship reveal, I couldn't stop loving this touching, beautiful, fun and engaging game. From the moment the music swells on the title screen to the moment the credits roll, Uncharted 3 is a masterpiece. That shouldn't surprise you. The original Drake's Fortune set the bar for visuals and third-person adventures on the PlayStation 3. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves greatly improved on that, added multiplayer and climbed its way to the 2009 IGN Game of the Year award. Developer Naughty Dog spent the two years since then making bigger moments -- think platforming in a capsized cruise ship and surviving a cargo plane crash -- and working on the few complaints from the last title. Complaints primarily stemming from the fact that, to some, Uncharted 2 felt too much like the original Uncharted. Uncharted 3's tale sounds familiar. We have the same cast of characters in our handsome hero Nathan Drake and his seasoned mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan and the same general idea of a lost city that needs finding before the bad guys get there. But this isn't the games that came before. Uncharted 3's greatest strength is its unpredictability. From the barroom brawl that opens the game and introduces its new melee system to a mid-game conversation between villainess Katherine Marlowe and Drake that literally redefines a pillar of this franchise, I didn't know what to expect in Uncharted 3. Naughty Dog sets aside the betrayal/twist formula used in the first two games and focuses on Nate and Sully's relationship. It takes you to the precipice of the Uncharted hallmarks you might expect, lets you stare at them, and then veers off in another direction. For the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat. \u201c Yes, the gameplay still revolves around climbing walls and shooting bad guys, but refinement is found those mechanics. For the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat. Uncharted 2's clumsy stealth parts no longer exist. Running through levels and taking cover doesn't get old because Naughty Dog has done so much to merge the gameplay with the story, perfecting the pacing and making everything look fantastic in the process thanks to cutting edge graphics and excellent cinematography. The end product rises above what the buttons do and how you maneuver Drake. Calling it a game sells Uncharted 3 short. This is an experience, a complete package. 121 Images When I rant about why Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is better than just about anything on the market -- about why I think it's my new favorite game of all time -- I don't talk about the firefights, the new ability to throw grenades back at enemies or collecting the game's 101 well-hidden treasures. I talk about the heart-wrenching section where Drake is by himself and completely lost. He's on his last legs, he's desperate, and I'm right there with him. I'm pushing him through the journey at hand and it's clear that it's a game, but as he stumbles, seeks shelter and loses hope, my heart breaks. This is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years. \u201c In a way, this is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years. Players know the Uncharted cast. Most love the banter between Drake and Sully, the love affair between Elena and Drake or the one-liners Drake shouts to himself as the game goes on. Naughty Dog created a universe here that players feel connected with, but, again, the developers toy with that. They insert things that take the mentor/pupil relationship to another level. They flesh out backstories, they break bonds, and they make us face the characters' worst fears. And, no, those fears aren't clowns. A story-driven affair, Uncharted 3's believability and connection with the player comes from its performances. For the third game in a row, the cast dazzles. The actors record their lines along with their movements, and this leads to characters that feel real. The chemistry between them lights up the game in a way most mediums would kill for -- from tiny touches like fist bumps to major moments of bickering between lovers. Add in a musical score that accentuates the action and layer on the game's trademark, \"best in the industry\" graphics -- sand clinging to Drake's hair, fire creeping up walls, sunlight filtering through tattered roofs -- and you can see where this game becomes more than pressing the X button and jamming on analog sticks. When the tale finishes, you can look forward to multiplayer. Uncharted 2 introduced competitive and cooperative modes for the series, and Uncharted 3 improves them to make something special. The standard menu returns (team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc.), but Naughty Dog adds bonuses known as Boosters and Kickbacks to round out the experience. These are upgradable bonuses that you equip to make the multiplayer experience more your own. Boosters augment your entire session -- one reduces respawn time, one lets you climb faster -- whereas the in-match medals you earn count toward unlocking your Kickback, which can instantly spawn an RPG or double your cash earned for a short period of time. These spice up the gameplay; you can pepper them into one of your four saved loadouts and have a skill set for any situation. This stuff will keep me coming back. Even when I have a terrible match in Uncharted 3 multiplayer, I see the cash I've earned counting toward my next level and I see my Boosters earning experience and becoming more powerful. Toss all this into the pot, and matches in Uncharted 3 multiplayer feel fresh every time. The verticality mixed with gunplay leads to different attack plans. There's a sweet science to deploying a Kickback at the perfect time for a critical kill. New Power Plays give teams getting blown out a leg-up like double damage so that everyone feels like they have a shot at competing. Plus, three team deathmatch (2v2v2) is awesome, and you can play split-screen with two different PSN profiles, a rarity on the PlayStation 3. For many of you, these multiplayer facts aren't news, as fans have been playing the final version of multiplayer as part of a North American Subway promotion for weeks. However, there was an outcry when the beta went live because Naughty Dog adjusted the damage dealt by bullets and players were now able to absorb more. Many threw their hands up in disgust, and Naughty Dog listened. The developers went in and dialed the damage back to what it was in the summer beta. Don't mistake this anecdote as a mistake; it points out the commitment Naughty Dog puts into this multiplayer community. The developers make a game and they want people to enjoy it, they listen to feedback, and they act. There's not much more you can ask from a game creator, and it's one of the reasons I want to keep playing and keep leveling. Add in the fact that Naughty Dog supported Uncharted 2 multiplayer until now and already has seven DLC packs planned for Uncharted 3 multiplayer , and it's clear this game has legs."

        "Content": "What if Call of Duty was different? This appears to be the defining question informing the direction of developer Treyarch\u2019s latest, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. While large portions of the design conform to the tenets established by prior iterations of the franchise, the unparalleled wealth of gameplay options and brilliant twists on the formula have shaped Black Ops II into the most ambitious and exciting Call of Duty ever made. It occasionally feels like the team might have strayed into territory they\u2019re not quite masters of, but significant tweaks to the multiplayer loadout system, as well as the realization of player agency in the campaign, make this far more than \u201cjust another Call of Duty.\u201d This is an evolution.  You Can Shape It, but This Story Isn\u2019t About the Hero The campaign narrative jumps between various characters\u2019 perspectives and also in time. The Cold War-era missions follows characters such as Alex Mason and Sgt. Frank Woods from the first Black Ops, while the 2025 missions follow Alex\u2019s son, David. All of these soldiers\u2019 fates are intertwined with the villain, Raul Menendez, and his organization Cordis Die. Menendez is the sort of villain you just can\u2019t seem to kill and, consequently, who knows how to hold a grudge. Thing is, he\u2019s not your typical, \u201cI\u2019m evil cause I do bad things,\u201d bad guy. Menendez is a tragic character, a product of imperialist nations\u2019 meddling during the Cold War and a survivor of some truly traumatic experiences. The story successfully casts Menendez in a light where I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about him. At times I wanted him dead, while at others I felt like he had a right to want revenge. Hell, I even vacillate between agreeing with his end goals. Like the film Inglourious Basterds, Black Ops II becomes less about you and the \u201cgood\u201d guys, and more about the motivations and perspective of the villain. The very fact that I\u2019m still thinking about how the story played out -- something unprecedented in a Call of Duty campaign -- is a testament to the strength of the writing. A great narrative already makes Black Ops II stand out in the pantheon of Call of Duty campaigns, but where it really sets itself apart is the addition of player choice and consequence. Moments and devices that would otherwise seem irrelevant -- like whether you find all of the intel in a level or choose to shoot someone -- can come back to haunt you, hurt you or help you. Failing objectives might result in new or more challenging missions rather than a restart screen. It\u2019s a brilliant riff on the traditional Call of Duty campaign design, and, combined with the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings. Most importantly, choice makes you apart of what you play; it\u2019s not just a story, it\u2019s your story. I may not have found the ending of my first playthrough satisfying because terrible things happened, but I appreciated that it was a direct byproduct of my actions. The effects of your choices are often evidenced in the new Strike Force missions, shorter objectives which give you control over a group of soldiers and various drones. Sometimes these objectives are a result of your decisions and performance, and they tend to have tangible effects on the outcome of your story. These tasks are worth playing because of their crucial role in the creation of your story, but the limited command controls make them less exciting. You can order your troops around the map from a strategic overhead view or via the usual first-person control, though neither is as tactical as intended. You can\u2019t rally soldiers on your position, and your AI allies will rush to die. Each objective essentially comes down to ordering my troops to move from point to point as a huge group while I single-handedly save the mission by taking direct control and fight a horde of foes. The importance of Strike Force\u2019s outcome adds tension and stress to the action, but the ineffective input and inept allies create an unnecessary challenge that compromises its potential success. Shooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missions and intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film. In that sense, Black Ops II is the classic Call of Duty formula at its best, with an important, defining difference: The emphasis on drone warfare, the exotic-but-grounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably high-tech signage and architecture makes Blacks Op II feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into non-historical settings. The team at Treyarch brings a bit of the multiplayer loadout flavor to the campaign as well. Before each mission you can now customize your character\u2019s weapons (restrictions apply to make sure you\u2019re not using a future weapon in the past, for instance), accessories and even give them perks. Every level also has challenges associated with it, and you can scope out the leaderboards to see how you stand up to your buddies. These are small details, but they\u2019re important because they layer on another reason to replay the stages. If for some bizarre reason the narrative doesn\u2019t grab you, then you still have lots of additional goals to try and achieve that are decidedly more \u201cgamey.\u201d  Take Your Class and Love it While not as big of a departure in structure as Treyarch\u2019s single-player, Black Ops II\u2019s multiplayer dares to defy the modus operandi, and provides a number of new options and modes that make it more engrossing than what\u2019s come before. Call of Duty has shaped the way other shooters present class and loadout designs for years, and Treyarch successfully redefines the standard with the Pick 10 system. The hook of Pick 10 comes from the ability to defy the loadout rules. Each attachment, weapon, grenade or perk counts as one of your ten points, and you can swap them out at will to create a huge number of combinations. Treyarch has also added in Wild Cards, which allow you to spend additional points to break even more rules, like equipping two primary weapons or up to six perks. Pick 10 allows the creation of the most specifically tuned classes in any shooter ever. You want to have a soldier with a pistol, four perks and two throwing axes? Do it. Maybe you want to snap three attachments to a LMG, ditching your grenades to give yourself additional perks or a badass secondary weapon for close quarters combat -- you can do that too. Pick 10 accomplishes something I didn\u2019t even realize I wanted: For Create a Class to be as exciting and enticing as it was when I first popped in the original Modern Warfare. I don\u2019t just experiment because I want to create a loadout perfectly tailored to a specific mode, but because it\u2019s a genuinely fun and intuitive system to use. A number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in Black Ops II. For instance perks now only affect your character, leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon. Thus if you want to do something like fast reload, which will make longtime players look for the Sleight of Hand perk, you\u2019ll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip attachment. The Kill Streak system has also been wisely replaced by Score Streaks, making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in, and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score. This accomplishes a majorly important feat: it makes every game less about your Kill / Death ratio. Sure, it still won\u2019t keep people from obsessing over it, but if you want to get it higher you\u2019re going to need to help with objectives. While I appreciate the rush that leveling up and unlocking items provides, it always felt strange to reward you with a stat reset after hitting the cap and Prestiging. Apparently some wise people at Treyarch agreed. Unlike previous games, after each of the 10 levels of Prestige you won\u2019t have your stats reset, but instead continue your weapon experience and challenge progress and earn even more rewards. For starters you now get a token that allows you to unlock any item regardless of its level requirement, forever. In addition you also get a Prestige Token that nets you either an additional Create a Class slot, a refund on all unlock tokens you\u2019ve spent during your progress to date, or the more traditional character wipe that resets all your stats. This completely changes my attitude towards Prestiging, and makes it something I actually want to do. As for modes, we get the time-tested classics TDM, CTF, Search and Destroy, etc., as well as some variations that keep multiplayer from feeling like a simple rehash. First there\u2019s Hardpoint, a version of Halo\u2019s Crazy King mode. You battle to capture specific points, holding them for as long as you can to rack up points. It\u2019s not exactly original, but the way it focuses the fight around specific points stands as a perfect example of how new modes can make specific Score Streaks and loadouts more viable (Take the Defender Score Streak on Hardpoint, you can thank me later). Another excellent addition to multiplayer is the option for multi-team battles. Returning modes like Kill Confirmed are a lot more interesting with four teams of three, and this option breathes a bit of new life into modes we\u2019ve all played to death. And of course you can still play these in four player local split-screen play, or take two people and go online. For all the years Call of Duty\u2019s been around, though, it\u2019s never quite managed to make it easy for new players to get into the experience right out of the gate. You pretty much jumped in right after campaign and started the level grind alongside players who have the skill of cyborg ninjas, which isn\u2019t exactly a fun introduction. Treyarch\u2019s changed this in a couple of important ways with Black Ops II, though, starting with Combat Training. From levels 1-10, new Call of Duty players can join others in battles against bots. After 10 you can still fight bots, but you\u2019ll only ever earn half the experience, ensuring no one uses this to level easily, but also keeping you from feeling forced to join public games to proceed. If all you ever want to do is smash bots with your buddies, you can create Custom games and fill them out with AI opponents, tweaking everything from the victory conditions to the player health to the amount of items and classes people can take in their loadouts. There\u2019s also a number of Party Game options, which still net you experience, and allow you to change up multiplayer pacing with sillier game modes like Sticks and Stones (crossbows, throwing axes and ballistic knives only) and One in the Chamber (your gun has only one bullet until you score a kill). There\u2019s simply more ways than ever to just have fun with Call of Duty\u2019s multiplayer in Black Ops II. Treyarch\u2019s also improved the competitive aspect of Call of Duty with the inclusion of the forwarding thinking League Play mode. League Play allows you and your friends to create teams, complete with a unique name and emblem, and hop into matches with everything unlocked right from the start. You simply play a few placement games to get matched up with similarly skilled teams, and then head out to see if you can earn your way to higher tiers. It\u2019s a proven system that\u2019s resulted in much fairer matches for strategy games like StarCraft II, and a welcome reprieve for those who want to skip the level grind entirely and just focus on tactics and skill building. People love to criticize the length of Call of Duty games, and if Black Ops II were only a campaign that might make sense, but this argument falls apart once you look at how much content is included. The legs of the franchise come not only from the single and multiplayer components, but, in the case of Black Ops II, from the increasingly robust and easy-to-use social features built right into the game. The Theater system was always really cool to me, but a bit too complicated for my tastes -- until now. You can still create films with a number of tailored shots, or you can just hit a single button and the game will automatically compile a decent highlight reel ready for easy upload to Elite. Elite\u2019s engaging tools and slough of helpful and interesting info can provide useful insights about you and your friends performances, potentially improving your game, but it\u2019s disappointing it\u2019s still only available for PS3 and Xbox players. Like the level creator in LittleBigPlanet, some of Black Ops II biggest multiplayer social features \u2013 namely, COD Casting and streaming \u2013 interest me more as a consumer than a creator. Whatever your preference, you can now shoutcast live matches in specific instances such as Custom Games for tournaments, getting a host of data about every player\u2019s performance. You can also watch replays, utilizing the codcast controls to get additional features which should give people with home capture setups more options.* Or if you want to try your hand at streaming, you can do that too by syncing your YouTube account with Black Ops II. The quality and framerate of the stream isn\u2019t the best, and it only works with League Play matches, but both streaming and COD Casting offer ways to connect with the community that despite their limitations feel ahead of their time and unlike anything else the competition brings to bear.  It\u2019s Time to Use Your Braaaiinssss Black Ops II\u2019s Zombies mode is the deepest the franchise has seen, even if its \u201ccampaign\u201d narrative is reliant on the self-imposed stories arising from your roaming, zombie-slaughtering adventures with three pals. The thing is, even if Tranzit doesn\u2019t come together as a traditional campaign, it\u2019s still a fun alternative to the otherwise serious CoD gameplay. The ridiculousness of the Zombies world is pervasive, and the constant banter between characters, the silly robotic bus driver or the horror movie camp that saturates every second keeps things light. Moreover it\u2019s a lot of fun to do something cooperative in Call of Duty. Fighting off increasingly difficult waves of undead inspires a different sort of tension than anything else the series has to offer, and with Zombies, it\u2019s just about goofing off and having some laughs rather than trying to be the best. Tranzit offers not only a different pace from the rest of Black Ops II, but also rewards exploration with new mechanics, secrets and easter eggs that encourage you to try it over and over. It\u2019s intentionally designed vague, leaving you to your own devices to find random objects to combine into machines or defensive items in the environment. Once you build them you\u2019re given no explanation about how to use them. It\u2019s a bit aggravating, sure, but when you stumble upon a solution it\u2019s also really rewarding, especially when that knowledge is applied to your evolving Zombies routine Zombies mode is filled out with Survival mode and the new competitive Grief mode. Survival feels a bit hollow now that there\u2019s the option to play in the larger Tranzit world, but it\u2019s an alternative for people who\u2019d rather just defend a single area and forgo all the exploration. Grief is another silly addition to zombies, pitting two teams against one another in an effort to see who can hold out the longest. You can\u2019t directly harm one another, but you can stun them when they try to revive their buddies, or even throw meat at them to make them more attractive to the undead legions. Both Grief and Survival feel more like afterthoughts when compared to Tranzit, but they were fun distractions nonetheless, and, alongside custom game options, provide even more ways to lose hours and hours to Zombies.  Which Platform Should You Play? We played on 360 for review, but having spent time with the PC version we can safely say they're virtually identical. The PC version doesn't have Elite, but it does feature additional options that PC players expect such as remappable controls and advanced graphics settings. Essentially, what it comes to is this: pick up the version where you'll have the most friends to play, because long after the campaign is over you'll have hours of awesome multiplayer and zombies to dive into. The PS3 version got off to a rocky start, with console lock ups, issues where multiplayer games just wouldn't launch and a host of other infuriating problems. Thankfully, though, things seem to have cleared up after just a couple of days, with even more patches on the way to shore things up in the near future. At this point the PS3 version feels virtually identical to the 360, with only occasional texture pop in and framerate drops that ultimately don't detract from the overall experience.  Level for level, gun for gun, the campaign, multiplayer and zombies content of Black Ops 2 on Wii U is almost the same. This version may cut the livestreaming feature, and currently doesn\u2019t have Elite, but it makes up for it with some nifty GamePad functionality. The GamePad really steals the show on Black Ops II Wii U. While you can play with a Wii remote and nunchuck, a classic controller or even the new Wii U Pro controller, the GamePad\u2019s button layout feels closest to what you might expect coming from the 360 or PS3 versions. It also offers some touchscreen options in multiplayer that are sometimes useful, and completely optional to use. You can change your class without having to bring up the start screen, for instance, or call in Scorestreaks with on-screen buttons (less than ideal in an intense situation, but it is optional), or use the GamePad as your minimap regardless of what controller you\u2019re using. Moreover it\u2019s built-in screen offers functionality that no other platform has. Namely, the ability to play any portion of the game via SecondScreen gameplay. Black Ops 2 occasionally drops in frame-rate no matter how you play it, but both regular and SecondScreen gameplay function well enough that I never felt at a disadvantage or that it took away from the fun, even when playing the super speedy online multiplayer. Even cooler, you can play online split-screen multiplayer without having to actually split your screens. You can still play with two people on the same TV, or, thanks to some brilliant designers, use the GamePad as your second player\u2019s screen. One additional caveat about Black Ops II on Wii U: Its multiplayer is every bit as fun as that on other platforms, but hardly anyone is playing right now. I could easily find games of Team Deathmatch, but finding games in other modes or in League Play is currently nigh impossible."

        "id": "147bf9629f57423d388e2c304bbe369d",
        "Content": "Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn\u2019t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It\u2019s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.  Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare\u2019s best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S. The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten \u2013 not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It\u2019s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.  Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you\u2019ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and \u2013 in the case of the space and water missions \u2013 special consideration for verticality and physics. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation\u2019s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.  But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It\u2019s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.  It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling \u2014 it's more about dumb fun \u2014 and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he\u2019s a member of the Ghosts. And then there\u2019s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.  The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.  Or, in the case of those for whom multiplayer is the primary focus, it handily gets out of the way other than to serve as the inspiration for map environments, equipment, and weapon design.  Ghosts preserves much of the look and feel of the traditional Call of Duty multiplayer experience, but introduces sweeping changes that make it more personalized, more diverse, and better balanced. At its core lies the expansive new Create a Soldier system, which affords us the ability to create and customize 10 unique characters, each with up to six loadouts, for a total of 60 available classes and 20,000 possible configurations. Create a Soldier also riffs on Black Ops II\u2019s Pick 10 system, allowing you to forego certain equipment in order to outfit a primary weapon with extra attachments or enable extra perks. In all, there are an impressive 39 weapons, 12 pieces of equipment, 35 new perks, 36 scorestreaks spanning three categories, and various weapons attachments to choose from.  Create a Solider is ambitious in its scope, and the sheer breadth of options caters to and empowers every style of play. Whether you want to run around like a high-powered knife-wielding mutant or move stealthily through a map by using heightened senses, you can. But for all of its versatility, Create a Soldier is dauntingly complex next to previous Call of Duty games. Even after hours of matches and experimentation, I felt as though I had only begun to understand the nuances of each of the 35 unique perks and how to optimize my classes for a specific style of play. On the one hand, Create a Soldier\u2019s depth will have enthusiast players honing their perfect loadouts for months, but on the other, it makes for a more challenging entry-level experience.  It's a credit to developer Infinity Ward that even while running around with a maxed-out weapon and the best complimentary perks I could find, at no point did I see a player gain a noticeable advantage. Unlike Black Ops II, which favors lightweight SMGs, Ghosts\u2019 balance encourages you to explore a variety of weapon types. SMGs are considerably less effective, while assault rifles are faster to shoulder and have a reduced impact on speed. A new class of weapons, called marksman rifles, bridges the gap between sniper rifles and assault rifles, providing range and power with greater mobility. Sniper rifles remain largely unaltered with two notable exceptions: new optics that preserve (but blur) your peripheral vision, and aim-assist has been reduced to make obnoxious quick-scoping harder to exploit.  The added emphasis on ranged weapons is paired with considerably larger maps, which greatly outnumber those that feature more traditional tight-quarters designs in the 15 included battlefields. In deathmatch-style gametypes, teams will often find themselves spread across smaller contingents at different sides of the map, whereas objective modes will draw everybody to certain points. Instead of just funneling players toward enemies via a limited number of paths, Ghosts presents an array of alternative routes, making team play far more effective than traditional run-and-gun strategy \u2013 in fact, running around these large maps gets lonely and boring. Traditional lone wolf-style play also throws a wrench in the spawn system, making enemies often appear nearby without warning. Playing in a well-coordinated group is more gratifying than ever, but more casual solo games can be frustrating.  There\u2019s also the much-touted map dynamicism, which disrupts pathways and sightlines using everything from player-triggered gates to a missile strike that turns the environment to a smoldering wasteland. The effect is less impactful and cinematic than Battlefield 4\u2019s crumbling buildings and dams, but with considerably smaller maps and faster-paced gameplay, grander scale or frequency would have been distracting. Instead, the traps and map events are only brief interruptions that can shake things up if one team becomes entrenched, but won\u2019t fundamentally alter the course of a game.  Ghosts multiplayer introduces five brand-new gametypes alongside all of the series staples like Domination and Kill Confirmed, for a total of 13 different modes. Although many of the new modes expand upon existing gametypes, each adds a fresh dynamic. My favorite new addition, Grind, is like Kill Confirmed, except that it requires you to not only collect dog tags from downed enemies, but also deposit them in one of two \u201cbanks\u201d on the map before being killed yourself. Another, Cranked, is like Team Deathmatch, but whenever you score a kill, you\u2019re given a 30 seconds to rack up another kill \u2013 or else you'll explode. Although they\u2019re simple modifiers, the new gametypes are immensely fun and breathe new life into multiplayer.  Extinction, Ghosts\u2019 new alien invasion mode, is better compared to Valve's Left 4 Dead games than Treyarch\u2019s zombie modes from Black Ops. It's a four-player cooperative mode wherein you fight off monstrous creatures through a miniature campaign set in a large, multi-stage level. Unlike zombies, the aliens are nimble and unpredictable, leaping over objects and scaling walls. It's a tough challenge, and teams must carefully consider their loadouts, special abilities, equipment, and power-up trees to ensure survival, making for an interesting strategic dynamic.  For a more traditional Call of Duty experience, but sheltered from the fierce competitive landscape of multiplayer, there\u2019s Squads: a suite of cooperative modes that offers wave defense (AKA horde mode) and competitive bot matches. In a cool touch, Squads uses your custom characters and classes as the basis for A.I. soldiers that play alongside you to battle other bots or human players. Bot matches are hardly novel for the genre, but the soldiers in Squads are especially notable because of how easy it is to mistake them for human players due to their use of advanced tactics. It's impressive how they move through maps aggressively, and appear to be acutely aware of other players.  Squads is an excellent testing ground, and offers a nice respite from online multiplayer while also contributing to online character progression using the unified Create a Soldier system. Most importantly, the new Call of Duty profile system allows players to carry over their stats, unlocks, and characters created for Squads or multiplayer across generations. If you play on Xbox 360 and visit a friend who owns a Xbox One, your character and all progression is carried over, and comes back home with you.  This is possible, in part, because of cross-generation, cross-platform feature parity. Character customization, maps, dynamic events, weapons, gametypes, and constant 60fps multiplayer framerates are ubiquitous across current- and next-gen platforms. The biggest variations between platforms falls upon visuals and player counts. On the current-gen versions Ghosts looks nearly identical, though I did encounter occasional framerate issues during the single-player campaign on PS3 and PS4, whereas my time with the Xbox One version was stable throughout.  Like Black Ops II, the Wii U version takes advantage of the gamepad to present a secondary display for the in-game map and provide touchscreen shortcuts to custom loadouts. The gamepad\u2019s display can also be used to play without a TV, though it also supports Wii Remotes and the controller. Graphically, the Wii U version is comparable to Xbox 360 and PS3, and overall, runs smoothly. Unsurprisingly, the PC version scales well from low- to high-end machines, and in most cases, looks superior to the next-gen experience.  It\u2019s difficult to appreciate the variation between current-gen and next-gen in TV commercials or a browser window, but up close and personal, the difference is drastic. Whereas the current-gen versions look muddy with blotchy textures, characters, weapon models, and environments are presented in vivid detail on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Call of Duty engine fares surprisingly well on next-gen, but even then Ghosts lacks a lot of the added atmospheric effects and visual panache that makes competing games look so realistic. I\u2019m eager to see what a future Call of Duty looks like when maintaining 60 frames-per-second on current-gen is no longer a concern.  When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there\u2019s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality.  It\u2019s certainly going to be a sticking point for those who demand the highest fidelity experience, but the difference is harder to identify in absence of a side-by-side comparison.  Oddly, the Xbox One version makes no use of the haptic feedback motors built into the controller\u2019s triggers, and the DualShock 4\u2019s trackpad is used solely as a button to toggle the in-game scoreboard during multiplayer.  There is, however, one notable exclusion from current-gen. Historically, Call of Duty has limited a majority of its modes to 12 players, but offered an additional playlist that supports 18-player matches known as Ground War. While the larger-scale matches live on with the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, owners of the Xbox 360, Wii U, and PS3 versions are capped at 12 players. It\u2019s a surprising step back for the series, and the larger maps could have benefited from the higher player count.  It should also be noted that my smooth multiplayer experience was hosted on a dedicated server hosted by Activision \u2013 and most of yours will be, too. Activision says that all platforms will use a hybrid of dedicated servers and peer-to-peer matchmaking, which should eliminate many of the lag issues we've seen in the past. If all goes well, the days of being tossed into a game hosted by someone 2,000 miles away on a dial-up connection will be behind us."

        "Content": "What if Call of Duty was different? This appears to be the defining question informing the direction of developer Treyarch\u2019s latest, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. While large portions of the design conform to the tenets established by prior iterations of the franchise, the unparalleled wealth of gameplay options and brilliant twists on the formula have shaped Black Ops II into the most ambitious and exciting Call of Duty ever made. It occasionally feels like the team might have strayed into territory they\u2019re not quite masters of, but significant tweaks to the multiplayer loadout system, as well as the realization of player agency in the campaign, make this far more than \u201cjust another Call of Duty.\u201d This is an evolution.  You Can Shape It, but This Story Isn\u2019t About the Hero The campaign narrative jumps between various characters\u2019 perspectives and also in time. The Cold War-era missions follows characters such as Alex Mason and Sgt. Frank Woods from the first Black Ops, while the 2025 missions follow Alex\u2019s son, David. All of these soldiers\u2019 fates are intertwined with the villain, Raul Menendez, and his organization Cordis Die. Menendez is the sort of villain you just can\u2019t seem to kill and, consequently, who knows how to hold a grudge. Thing is, he\u2019s not your typical, \u201cI\u2019m evil cause I do bad things,\u201d bad guy. Menendez is a tragic character, a product of imperialist nations\u2019 meddling during the Cold War and a survivor of some truly traumatic experiences. The story successfully casts Menendez in a light where I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about him. At times I wanted him dead, while at others I felt like he had a right to want revenge. Hell, I even vacillate between agreeing with his end goals. Like the film Inglourious Basterds, Black Ops II becomes less about you and the \u201cgood\u201d guys, and more about the motivations and perspective of the villain. The very fact that I\u2019m still thinking about how the story played out -- something unprecedented in a Call of Duty campaign -- is a testament to the strength of the writing. A great narrative already makes Black Ops II stand out in the pantheon of Call of Duty campaigns, but where it really sets itself apart is the addition of player choice and consequence. Moments and devices that would otherwise seem irrelevant -- like whether you find all of the intel in a level or choose to shoot someone -- can come back to haunt you, hurt you or help you. Failing objectives might result in new or more challenging missions rather than a restart screen. It\u2019s a brilliant riff on the traditional Call of Duty campaign design, and, combined with the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings. Most importantly, choice makes you apart of what you play; it\u2019s not just a story, it\u2019s your story. I may not have found the ending of my first playthrough satisfying because terrible things happened, but I appreciated that it was a direct byproduct of my actions. The effects of your choices are often evidenced in the new Strike Force missions, shorter objectives which give you control over a group of soldiers and various drones. Sometimes these objectives are a result of your decisions and performance, and they tend to have tangible effects on the outcome of your story. These tasks are worth playing because of their crucial role in the creation of your story, but the limited command controls make them less exciting. You can order your troops around the map from a strategic overhead view or via the usual first-person control, though neither is as tactical as intended. You can\u2019t rally soldiers on your position, and your AI allies will rush to die. Each objective essentially comes down to ordering my troops to move from point to point as a huge group while I single-handedly save the mission by taking direct control and fight a horde of foes. The importance of Strike Force\u2019s outcome adds tension and stress to the action, but the ineffective input and inept allies create an unnecessary challenge that compromises its potential success. Shooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missions and intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film. In that sense, Black Ops II is the classic Call of Duty formula at its best, with an important, defining difference: The emphasis on drone warfare, the exotic-but-grounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably high-tech signage and architecture makes Blacks Op II feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into non-historical settings. The team at Treyarch brings a bit of the multiplayer loadout flavor to the campaign as well. Before each mission you can now customize your character\u2019s weapons (restrictions apply to make sure you\u2019re not using a future weapon in the past, for instance), accessories and even give them perks. Every level also has challenges associated with it, and you can scope out the leaderboards to see how you stand up to your buddies. These are small details, but they\u2019re important because they layer on another reason to replay the stages. If for some bizarre reason the narrative doesn\u2019t grab you, then you still have lots of additional goals to try and achieve that are decidedly more \u201cgamey.\u201d  Take Your Class and Love it While not as big of a departure in structure as Treyarch\u2019s single-player, Black Ops II\u2019s multiplayer dares to defy the modus operandi, and provides a number of new options and modes that make it more engrossing than what\u2019s come before. Call of Duty has shaped the way other shooters present class and loadout designs for years, and Treyarch successfully redefines the standard with the Pick 10 system. The hook of Pick 10 comes from the ability to defy the loadout rules. Each attachment, weapon, grenade or perk counts as one of your ten points, and you can swap them out at will to create a huge number of combinations. Treyarch has also added in Wild Cards, which allow you to spend additional points to break even more rules, like equipping two primary weapons or up to six perks. Pick 10 allows the creation of the most specifically tuned classes in any shooter ever. You want to have a soldier with a pistol, four perks and two throwing axes? Do it. Maybe you want to snap three attachments to a LMG, ditching your grenades to give yourself additional perks or a badass secondary weapon for close quarters combat -- you can do that too. Pick 10 accomplishes something I didn\u2019t even realize I wanted: For Create a Class to be as exciting and enticing as it was when I first popped in the original Modern Warfare. I don\u2019t just experiment because I want to create a loadout perfectly tailored to a specific mode, but because it\u2019s a genuinely fun and intuitive system to use. A number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in Black Ops II. For instance perks now only affect your character, leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon. Thus if you want to do something like fast reload, which will make longtime players look for the Sleight of Hand perk, you\u2019ll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip attachment. The Kill Streak system has also been wisely replaced by Score Streaks, making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in, and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score. This accomplishes a majorly important feat: it makes every game less about your Kill / Death ratio. Sure, it still won\u2019t keep people from obsessing over it, but if you want to get it higher you\u2019re going to need to help with objectives. While I appreciate the rush that leveling up and unlocking items provides, it always felt strange to reward you with a stat reset after hitting the cap and Prestiging. Apparently some wise people at Treyarch agreed. Unlike previous games, after each of the 10 levels of Prestige you won\u2019t have your stats reset, but instead continue your weapon experience and challenge progress and earn even more rewards. For starters you now get a token that allows you to unlock any item regardless of its level requirement, forever. In addition you also get a Prestige Token that nets you either an additional Create a Class slot, a refund on all unlock tokens you\u2019ve spent during your progress to date, or the more traditional character wipe that resets all your stats. This completely changes my attitude towards Prestiging, and makes it something I actually want to do. As for modes, we get the time-tested classics TDM, CTF, Search and Destroy, etc., as well as some variations that keep multiplayer from feeling like a simple rehash. First there\u2019s Hardpoint, a version of Halo\u2019s Crazy King mode. You battle to capture specific points, holding them for as long as you can to rack up points. It\u2019s not exactly original, but the way it focuses the fight around specific points stands as a perfect example of how new modes can make specific Score Streaks and loadouts more viable (Take the Defender Score Streak on Hardpoint, you can thank me later). Another excellent addition to multiplayer is the option for multi-team battles. Returning modes like Kill Confirmed are a lot more interesting with four teams of three, and this option breathes a bit of new life into modes we\u2019ve all played to death. And of course you can still play these in four player local split-screen play, or take two people and go online. For all the years Call of Duty\u2019s been around, though, it\u2019s never quite managed to make it easy for new players to get into the experience right out of the gate. You pretty much jumped in right after campaign and started the level grind alongside players who have the skill of cyborg ninjas, which isn\u2019t exactly a fun introduction. Treyarch\u2019s changed this in a couple of important ways with Black Ops II, though, starting with Combat Training. From levels 1-10, new Call of Duty players can join others in battles against bots. After 10 you can still fight bots, but you\u2019ll only ever earn half the experience, ensuring no one uses this to level easily, but also keeping you from feeling forced to join public games to proceed. If all you ever want to do is smash bots with your buddies, you can create Custom games and fill them out with AI opponents, tweaking everything from the victory conditions to the player health to the amount of items and classes people can take in their loadouts. There\u2019s also a number of Party Game options, which still net you experience, and allow you to change up multiplayer pacing with sillier game modes like Sticks and Stones (crossbows, throwing axes and ballistic knives only) and One in the Chamber (your gun has only one bullet until you score a kill). There\u2019s simply more ways than ever to just have fun with Call of Duty\u2019s multiplayer in Black Ops II. Treyarch\u2019s also improved the competitive aspect of Call of Duty with the inclusion of the forwarding thinking League Play mode. League Play allows you and your friends to create teams, complete with a unique name and emblem, and hop into matches with everything unlocked right from the start. You simply play a few placement games to get matched up with similarly skilled teams, and then head out to see if you can earn your way to higher tiers. It\u2019s a proven system that\u2019s resulted in much fairer matches for strategy games like StarCraft II, and a welcome reprieve for those who want to skip the level grind entirely and just focus on tactics and skill building. People love to criticize the length of Call of Duty games, and if Black Ops II were only a campaign that might make sense, but this argument falls apart once you look at how much content is included. The legs of the franchise come not only from the single and multiplayer components, but, in the case of Black Ops II, from the increasingly robust and easy-to-use social features built right into the game. The Theater system was always really cool to me, but a bit too complicated for my tastes -- until now. You can still create films with a number of tailored shots, or you can just hit a single button and the game will automatically compile a decent highlight reel ready for easy upload to Elite. Elite\u2019s engaging tools and slough of helpful and interesting info can provide useful insights about you and your friends performances, potentially improving your game, but it\u2019s disappointing it\u2019s still only available for PS3 and Xbox players. Like the level creator in LittleBigPlanet, some of Black Ops II biggest multiplayer social features \u2013 namely, COD Casting and streaming \u2013 interest me more as a consumer than a creator. Whatever your preference, you can now shoutcast live matches in specific instances such as Custom Games for tournaments, getting a host of data about every player\u2019s performance. You can also watch replays, utilizing the codcast controls to get additional features which should give people with home capture setups more options.* Or if you want to try your hand at streaming, you can do that too by syncing your YouTube account with Black Ops II. The quality and framerate of the stream isn\u2019t the best, and it only works with League Play matches, but both streaming and COD Casting offer ways to connect with the community that despite their limitations feel ahead of their time and unlike anything else the competition brings to bear.  It\u2019s Time to Use Your Braaaiinssss Black Ops II\u2019s Zombies mode is the deepest the franchise has seen, even if its \u201ccampaign\u201d narrative is reliant on the self-imposed stories arising from your roaming, zombie-slaughtering adventures with three pals. The thing is, even if Tranzit doesn\u2019t come together as a traditional campaign, it\u2019s still a fun alternative to the otherwise serious CoD gameplay. The ridiculousness of the Zombies world is pervasive, and the constant banter between characters, the silly robotic bus driver or the horror movie camp that saturates every second keeps things light. Moreover it\u2019s a lot of fun to do something cooperative in Call of Duty. Fighting off increasingly difficult waves of undead inspires a different sort of tension than anything else the series has to offer, and with Zombies, it\u2019s just about goofing off and having some laughs rather than trying to be the best. Tranzit offers not only a different pace from the rest of Black Ops II, but also rewards exploration with new mechanics, secrets and easter eggs that encourage you to try it over and over. It\u2019s intentionally designed vague, leaving you to your own devices to find random objects to combine into machines or defensive items in the environment. Once you build them you\u2019re given no explanation about how to use them. It\u2019s a bit aggravating, sure, but when you stumble upon a solution it\u2019s also really rewarding, especially when that knowledge is applied to your evolving Zombies routine Zombies mode is filled out with Survival mode and the new competitive Grief mode. Survival feels a bit hollow now that there\u2019s the option to play in the larger Tranzit world, but it\u2019s an alternative for people who\u2019d rather just defend a single area and forgo all the exploration. Grief is another silly addition to zombies, pitting two teams against one another in an effort to see who can hold out the longest. You can\u2019t directly harm one another, but you can stun them when they try to revive their buddies, or even throw meat at them to make them more attractive to the undead legions. Both Grief and Survival feel more like afterthoughts when compared to Tranzit, but they were fun distractions nonetheless, and, alongside custom game options, provide even more ways to lose hours and hours to Zombies.  Which Platform Should You Play? We played on 360 for review, but having spent time with the PC version we can safely say they're virtually identical. The PC version doesn't have Elite, but it does feature additional options that PC players expect such as remappable controls and advanced graphics settings. Essentially, what it comes to is this: pick up the version where you'll have the most friends to play, because long after the campaign is over you'll have hours of awesome multiplayer and zombies to dive into. The PS3 version got off to a rocky start, with console lock ups, issues where multiplayer games just wouldn't launch and a host of other infuriating problems. Thankfully, though, things seem to have cleared up after just a couple of days, with even more patches on the way to shore things up in the near future. At this point the PS3 version feels virtually identical to the 360, with only occasional texture pop in and framerate drops that ultimately don't detract from the overall experience. * Originally the review mistakenly said you could codcast recorded matches and upload them to YouTube, as well as codcast live League Play Matches. It also said that the livestreaming feature was on PS3 / 360, while it's also on PC. We've edited the text for clarification, as well as provided additional details about how codcasting works. IGN regrets the error."

        "Content": "Foamstars has the energy of a Sega Dreamcast game that was made specifically to look good on a quarterly earnings report. With its eclectic soundtrack and sterile-feeling art style, this third-person PvP shooter puts some creative twists on the winning formula coined by Splatoon \u2013 but its commitment to that bubbly theme has a false earnestness to it, weakening its strong foundation with just about every multiplayer monetization trend from the last 10 years. For every clever map design or killer song, there\u2019s a bad voice performance or a cosmetic pack that literally costs more than the price of Foamstars itself. There is still a fun competitive shooter here if you manage to surf deep enough into its sea of foam, but you\u2019ll have to wade past a whole bunch of red flags to find it. As is upsettingly laid out in its brief and painfully easy single-player campaign, you play as a Foamstar: a person who uses their odd ability to excrete a foam-like body fluid to compete in the Foamsmash Tournament, a series of competitive events set in the Las Vegas-inspired city of Bath Vegas. This extremely gross fact is never really explained beyond that, but it does let you cover the ground with bubbly bullets that morph each arena\u2019s topography, allowing you to do cool things like build mounds of foam to get the jump on your opponents or wall them off from an objective. Think Splatoon\u2019s ink, just with the ability to stack it up. Also like Splatoon, your character can move more quickly in the foam by surfing on it, which adds a welcome sense of speed that lets you collaborate with teammates in creative ways. Foamstars Screenshots 9 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Foamstars takes things a step further by weaponizing surfing; once you deal enough damage to chill (not kill) your opponent, they become covered in foam, rendering them nearly immobile before you surf into them to finish the job. On the other hand, if your teammate is foamed up and needs help, you can surf into them to revive them from the brink of death \u2014 or, from being put on ice, that is. This small mechanic makes a world of difference by both encouraging and rewarding aggressive play. Suddenly a foamed-up opponent or teammate becomes a chokepoint to strategize around, especially in the Smash The Star mode, which crowns one person on each team as a Star Player and requires you to take them out while protecting your own. Smash the Star is positioned as Foamstars\u2019 central mode so it\u2019s always available to play, whereas the other two standard options, Happy Bath Survival and Rubber Duck Party, rotate on the hour. Happy Bath Survival is my favorite, and easily the most unique mode Foamstars has to offer: teams split into parties of two, with half of each team facing off against one another in a truncated version of Smash the Star while the leftover pairs from each team lather the map in foam from a perch above the battlefield. Scaling down the deathmatch to a two-on-two confrontation with a longer respawn timer nicely distills the fast-paced fun of Smash the Star into something more focused, yielding white-knuckle showdowns that carry more weight \u2013 but having teammates constantly spraying the battlefield with also foam adds a really fun layer to this mode, as you can use it to disrupt your opponents, play defense, build a tower for your teammates, or just keep the other team from claiming too much turf. A foamed-up opponent becomes a chokepoint to strategize around. \u201c As for Rubber Duck Party, don\u2019t let its deceptively childish name fool you; this is Splatoon\u2019s extremely engaging and highly competitive Tower Control mode down to a T. Blending King of the Hill and Capture the Flag, you and your team need to hold the small area on top of a duck and ride it into your opponents\u2019 base. You need to stand on a small, elevated, and vulnerable area on the duck\u2019s head to capture it, which is a risky point to hold as it exposes you to nearly the entire map and an all-but-certain volley of foam. And if you want to double down on the danger, holding the Circle button on a PS5 controller while your team is in control of the duck lets you do a short dance to boost its speed. While Foamstars doesn\u2019t win any points for originality by copying this mode so closely, it\u2019s still a tried and true classic that\u2019s just as fun here. Unlike Foamstars\u2019 inky predecessor, all three game types are available in its various ranked modes. Also locked behind needless timing constraints, solo and team-based ranked play aren\u2019t both available at the same time, which makes ranking up a confusing dance that hasn\u2019t begun to make sense to me even after hours in the ranked queue. For example, your ranking in each placement match doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with your individual performance, but your team\u2019s as a whole. In matches where we lost (sometimes thanks to AFK players), my performance was arbitrarily rated low despite leading my team in playing the objective. Wins, on the other hand, all won me the same rating regardless of whether I was carried by a teammate or led the lobby in chills. It\u2019s all frustrating as a result, making me less inclined to try and grind my way up its ladder. How disturbed are you to learn that the foam in Foamstars is a body fluid they excrete? Extremely, I am going to have nightmares It is pretty weird, yeah I guess if that's the lore it's fine? I think it's cool/funny! Answer See Results Rather than having a large pool of maps that get slightly reworked based on whatever mode you\u2019re playing, each mode has its own set of unique maps, which is as much in Foamstars\u2019 favor as it is a drag. On the one hand, it guarantees that every match takes place in an environment designed specifically around that mode\u2019s mechanics \u2013 for example, the map Fusion Coaster Kingdom the rubber ducky you need to capture on a tall roller coaster track, forcing you to get creative with your platforming if you want to take the advantage or get the jump on the other team. But on the other hand, there are only three or four maps available for each mode, and that small handful of options means they can get stale pretty quickly. Some of Foamstars\u2019 bigger maps feel sparse by comparison, too. Wide lanes and open spaces overestimate just how quickly foam can stack up when foaming the ground isn\u2019t part of the objective, making the middle of many maps like Aqua Blast Adventures into a no-mans-land rather than a foamy battlefield. Foamstars\u2019 roster of eight unique characters is also disappointingly slim, though each of them at least has distinct strengths and weaknesses that add diversity to the lineup and cater to different playstyles. Soa, Foamstars\u2019 pop idol mascot, has some strong mobility thanks to an ability that lets her perform a jump that doubles as a dodge, allowing her to safely make aggressive plays. Tonix, on the other hand, isn\u2019t as mobile but she can put down a lot of foam to help her teammates by creating better vantage points and even set turrets to back them up. My favorite so far is \u0394GITO (yes, his name has a triangle in it), who is a shark-obsessed \u201cPro-Gamer\u201d with a shotgun-like bubble blaster and a movement-friendly special ability that rewards you for going for chills. The monetization would feel pretty brazen even for a free-to-play game. \u201c If you aren\u2019t interested in grinding out PvP matches, you can also take on missions to save Bath Vegas from an onslaught of foamy baddies with up to three other players in what generally boils down to a shooting gallery-like horde mode. Interestingly, the multiplayer version of these missions adds roguelike progression between rounds, which allows you to build around your character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in some highly satisfying ways that make you feel like you\u2019re breaking its systems while still facing a challenge. Despite its extremely straightforward setup, with wave after wave of enemies flying at you on the same boring square arena without any change beyond the foam you and your teammates lay down, the multiplayer version is surprisingly satisfying to fight your way through. The same can\u2019t be said about the single-player version, which acts as Foamstars\u2019 story mode and is so easy I thought I might\u2019ve accidentally missed a difficulty setting somewhere in Foamstars\u2019 slow menus. No matter the mode, playing matches provides you with experience points, which fill up Foamstars\u2019 modestly-priced $6 (USD) battle pass. This doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel as far as online multiplayer games go, rewarding your time with premium content restricted to cosmetics only \u2013 except, that is, for each season\u2019s new character, which you\u2019ll need to slowly unlock as you play if you don\u2019t buy the battle pass to get them right away. The pass features a handful of exclusive skins for each Foamstar, emotes, weapon and surfboard wraps, and \u201cparty poppers\u201d that are used to boost your experience gain in a match. It\u2019s generally fairly standard stuff, but there\u2019s also no premium currency in it that you could put toward the next season\u2019s pass like many games have, so we\u2019ll probably end up having to pay piecemeal for each new season as they come. That\u2019s an aggressive tactic that would feel pretty brazen even for completely free-to-play games, let alone one with a price tag. But the bulk of Foamstars\u2019 cosmetics come from outside the battle pass, and instead of being walled behind an in-game currency that you can earn as you play (or even through the battle pass), nearly every cosmetic unlock costs real money. Where some are an annoying but reasonable enough $4, far too many of the items in the shop are absurdly priced, with several item sets clocking in at a gut-checking $45. Adding insult to costly injury, few of them are cool or interesting beyond a new skin that isn\u2019t just a palette swap, like giving Jet Justice a space suit. Even still, surfing around Foamstars\u2019 energetic fights can be a blast, and its foam mechanics add a fascinating level of variability to each map. It\u2019s just hard to reconcile the good parts of that frantic, bubble-flinging fun with nearly everything happening outside of it. With its use of generative AI to make in-game album covers (the generic quality of which doesn\u2019t live up to the awesome songs they hold), laughable \u201cmicro\u201d transactions, and small launch roster, its hard to convince myself to just sit back and enjoy the fights. Square Enix has promised regular updates to both Foamstars\u2019 competitive and cooperative modes, but the content drip seems to be just that; a drip feed. Each season is going to last a whopping five weeks, which seems far too long, especially without any new maps or modes planned until Season 4 \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be until mid-May, but there\u2019s a desperate need for them now. Charlie's Favorite 3rd Person Shooters With Creative Movement Movement is the most important part of a shooter for me. From Splatoon's creative take on platforming to Foamstars' cleverly weaponized movement, all of these games have really cool movement. See All 1 Splatoon 3 Nintendo EPD 2 Fortnite Epic Games 3 Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion Nintendo EPD 4 Splatoon Nintendo EAD 5 Splatoon 2 Nintendo 6 Foamstars Square Enix To make matters worse, Foamstars has placed all its bets on a horse with bad odds, following in the footsteps of Nintendo\u2019s famously confusing, unreliable online multiplayer. Almost all of Foamstars\u2019 game modes are only available at certain times, obnoxiously rotating on a fixed schedule or tied to specific days of the week. If it had launched with more maps and/or modes to cycle through, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but right now you can only play a handful of matches in a given mode before it pointlessly disappears into the Foamstars vault for an hour. This could easily be fixed by adding specific queuing options \u2013 but instead, Foamstars has chosen to surf in the choppy wake of an almost 10-year-old game without hitting the same highs. It will also never let you forget how impossibly sluggish everything, is as it annoyingly kicks you back to its hub area after each game, forcing you to cycle through its bafflingly slow matchmaking menus ad nauseam."

        "Content": "It feels as if the paint had just begun to dry on Splatoon after its release on the Wii U in 2015 when Nintendo applied a fresh coat and relaunched it with Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That may be why this sequel feels less like a whole new game than a new version of the first one that rolls up the best post-launch updates to the colorful and adorably non-violent team-based shooter and adds some new toys. Of course, considering the first game is a lot of fun, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you missed it for lack of a Wii U. And despite some questionable choices that can leave you trapped in matchmaking purgatory, the addition of a standout and clever take on a co-op horde mode provides some seriously addicting fun that has me coming back for more.  Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2\u2018s emphasis on using vibrant, ink-based weapons to splatter both enemies and the ground alike in your team color to control territory makes it a distinctive kind of visually rewarding fun. Controlling the ground is more than just a way of keeping score, though \u2013 you\u2019re far more mobile in your own territory, creating lots of opportunity for strategies around creating a highway to an objective and cutting off your opponents, and also setting up areas to submerge into the ink and replenish your ammo. The key to victory on the eight distinct and symmetrical maps currently in rotation often lies in being aware of terrain, ink management, and the opposition\u2019s plans.   Between the original arsenal, the guns added in post-launch updates, and the new ones introduced in Splatoon 2, there\u2019s plenty of ink-based weaponry to choose from, and yet each type has distinct uses. There\u2019s the fast and furious Inkbrush that covers ground quickly, contrasted with the Slosher that manages to turn a literal bucket of ink into a deadly close-range weapon. One of my favorites of the new batch is the Dualies, dual-pistol style weapons that have a great rate of fire and also let you quickly dodge-roll when firing to strafe enemies and release a concentrated burst of ink. There\u2019s also a brand-new array of special weapon powerups, many of which work well with proper coordination to break stalemates. The protective Ink Armor shields your entire team from harm, while the Tenta Missiles can lock onto and fire a salvo of ink strikes on multiple enemies.  Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game. \u201c  Going hand in hand with Splatoon 2\u2019s wealth of weapons is a set of gear that provides both style and bonuses in combat, with the added twist of over 20 random secondary abilities that unlock after you\u2019ve battled with them equipped enough times. These range from practical effects, like increasing ink recovery rates, to highly specialized abilities that can track the enemy who last splatted you or players you\u2019ve recently hit. Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game, too \u2013 you can now order any gear you\u2019ve seen on other people in-game using currency earned from battle, though the abilities attached to yours might not be the same due to random generation. Paying to scrub unwanted extra traits to make room for new ones leaves chunks of those abilities behind to apply to other gear, letting you mix and match from your inventory, or you can try your luck at unlocking different bonuses to replace the old ones that better align with your playstyle. This is a good way get value out of gear you earned but don\u2019t plan to wear: by scrubbing enough ammo-conserving bonuses from gear I wasn\u2019t using, I was then able to apply that trait to my favorite jersey (for a hefty price). Offering the chance to craft the perfect gear for your playstyle to give you a better edge in the more competitive Ranked Battles has kept me more invested than I was in the first Splatoon.  Aquatic Ambience  With a world this colorful and fun, it\u2019s great to see how much better people and places look on the Switch. Characters like the weapons dealer Sheldon and clothing merchant Jelfonzo look better than ever with more detailed models and textures, and the various forms of street art and graffiti scattered around the maps pop. The ink itself shimmers and glints with shiny flecks. Despite it all, Splatoon 2 never failed to maintain a smooth 60 frames per second in battle even with ink flying in all directions in a fully populated eight-player match. In handheld mode, things look great, and the option to set sensitivity for both modes of play helped immensely when switching between handheld and docked mode. I actually ended up swapping between motion and non-motion controls with surprising ease (though not being able to use the control stick to look up and down with motion and controls does take getting used to every time).   Solo Artist  Splatoon 2 brings back a very familiar and simple 32-mission single-player campaign that, with some exceptions, follows the style of its predecessor almost to the letter. There\u2019s a fair amount of hand-holding and will only take six or so hours to run through and find most collectibles, but missions provide some pretty fun ideas to play around with. There are places to stylishly grind on ink-rails like a squid version of Tony Hawk, and elsewhere you can lure giant, ink-vacuuming Squee-G robots into your enemies\u2019 path. Spraying ink to activate expanding sponges or moving platforms gives it a light Super Mario Sunshine feel, but it rarely challenges you the way co-op and multiplayer do. The most significant improvement over Splatoon is that the sequel\u2019s campaign lets you try out each of the weapon types, which is a great way to learn about their potential and how they can be used in multiplayer before jumping online. This focus on weapon research greatly extends replay value, as you can head back into levels you\u2019ve already conquered to discover new challenges based on the weapons\u2019 strengths and limitations.  Heading into Splatoon 2\u2019s main lobby lets you queue up for an engaging variety of online modes. Each mode automatically drops you in one of two maps that change up every two hours, which keeps things feeling fresh and doesn\u2019t let a map wear out its welcome as quickly as in other games, where the community often picks a favorite and plays it to death. The standard Turf War mode, which carries over from the original, is welcoming for beginners and veterans alike with the simple yet entertaining concept of competing to ink the most territory in three minutes. No two matches ever feel the same because the battlefield hotspots \u2013 dictated by the competing colors of ink \u2013 are constantly changing, and several times being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory. This is one case where I actually miss the Wii U gamepad \u2013 without the second-screen map or an always-on-screen minimap, you have to hold a button to overlay a map to see how things are going or jump to a teammate\u2019s location. This means you\u2019ll need to be that much more alert to the status of your team and the terrain, and finding a safe spot to check the map overlay took some getting used to.  Being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory. \u201c  Besides Turf Wars, Ranked and League Battles are where more precise and objective-based modes await. There\u2019s a king-of-the-hill-inspired Splat Zone, a tug-of-war style payload mode called Tower Control, and a spin on capture the flag where you carry a powerful but movement-impeding weapon to the enemy base called Rainmaker. Splat Zone is the most basic of the trio, and I prefer the modes where teams fight over a moving target like the mobile tower in Tower Control, and the Rainmaker weapon that was constantly changing hands. Even when both teams are working well together and locked in a tug-of-war for control, matches move at a quick pace, which prevents drawn-out stalemates. Even though Ranked Battles rotate between modes every few hours, I\u2019m glad each mode has their own ranking system so I can see which modes I\u2019m best at and where I need to improve.   The only real problems I\u2019ve encountered so far are the lobby\u2019s matchmaking system and the lack of a between-match loadout screen. Like in most games, once you\u2019ve picked your mode of choice you\u2019ll be sent to a room awaiting seven more players to begin. The catch is that nobody can cancel out or do anything else (such as the minigame the first Splatoon gave us to kill the time here) until either the match fills up or the timer runs out a couple of minutes later. Even if your group does fill up fast (which we can assume will be more likely after launch) and you get to play a round, you're still left with the problem of being unable to swap out weapons and gear between matches. I don\u2019t mind not being able to switch during a match because that makes you carefully consider your choices and commit to the role your weapon fills, and the matches aren\u2019t that long to begin with. But after playing with a great group and leveling up, the last thing I want to do is ditch them just so I can put on a new pair of shoes.  Cooperative Calamari  Where Splatoon 2\u2019s single-player campaign gently guides you through Octoling enemies, the new Salmon Run mode is an excellent cooperative foil. As hilarious as it is addicting, this mode puts you and up to three other players up against three timed waves of relentless enemies while collecting a quota of golden eggs from boss creatures and depositing them in a basket. Unlike other horde modes, Salmon Run deftly uses Splatoon\u2019s ink and territory mechanics to ensure you\u2019re not only splatting fish but also struggling to maintain control of the ground as enemies try to stifle your movement. The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I\u2019ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead, wielding trash as makeshift weapons and armor and shooting beams of ink from atop a tower of pots and pans. Their distinct looks help you assess threats quickly, which is essential because your team must neutralize them before being overwhelmed.   When playing online, you\u2019ll be given one of four random weapons to use for every wave, and I love how it challenged me to adapt and fill new roles on my team: In one wave I was sniping bosses with the Splat Charger, but in the next wave I had to clear a path to the egg basket with the Roller instead. Difficulty can be set when playing locally, and steadily grows when online thanks to the randomized nature of enemy waves and weapon loadouts, boss configurations, and special events like rising water levels or egg-stealing mothership invasions. Those shifting conditions kept me coming back to see what would happen next.  The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I\u2019ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead. \u201c  Playing locally with friends is a blast \u2013 my teammates and I frantically screamed out boss names and locations of golden eggs to direct each other to counter problems and capitalize on opportunities. But this also highlights how key communication is to survival, something that doesn\u2019t currently translate well in random online matchups, where you can only give basic callouts. Fortunately, with Nintendo\u2019s new companion app you can create voice chat groups with friends on your phone - but there are some significant problems. While you can check out nifty details about matches and order more gear from your app, the voice chat system feels woefully lacking. You can only chat with friends in certain modes, and while chatting your phone cannot be used for anything else (even turning off the screen will mute all conversation). Given that the app won\u2019t let you talk to friends outside of specific lobbies, and that I\u2019m not a fan of having my phone battery drained by a screen that can\u2019t be turned off, I\u2019m much more inclined to use Skype or Discord to talk with friends.  And speaking of bizarre catches: for some reason, the excellent co-op mode can only be played online on certain days for specific amounts of time \u2013 for instance, 5:00AM to 5:00PM \u2013 which is truly frustrating considering just how fun it is. After a fun weekend playing with friends, finding out I can\u2019t play again for two days can get annoying, especially when I can\u2019t discern any rhyme or reason to the Salmon Run schedule. Not being able to easily remember the next available slot time forces me to constantly check in-game for the next five openings. I get that Nintendo wants to ensure full rooms on the days Salmon Run is active, but this seems like a poor way to do it. I\u2019d rather have the option to queue up with friends online or have a way to easily back out if nobody is around to play with (going it alone is pretty much a death sentence). On the days the mode is active, you can earn quick rewards not found anywhere else which is a nice bonus; if you choose to play locally you can play as much as you want, but it takes much longer to earn bonuses."

        "Content": "Look, I enjoy the realism and attention to detail of a FIFA game as much as the next person, but sometimes you just want to swallow the soccer ball, pop it out as an egg, and then bounce that egg downfield until it hatches and wizzes past the goalie. That\u2019s just one of the incredibly silly moments that only the Mario Strikers series can provide, and Mario Strikers: Battle League is no exception. Trying to outmaneuver your friends and score a goal while engaging in a distressing amount of cartoon violence with no referee in sight had me howling with laughter one second and snarling in anger the next, and you can\u2019t ask for much more than that. Although it\u2019s been 15 years since Nintendo gave us the last Mario Strikers and shockingly little has been changed since then, that over-the-top mayhem and competitive intensity is a formula that holds up remarkably well. Mario's twisted version of soccer has two teams of four compete to kick, throw, headbutt, or butt-stomp a soccer ball into the rival team\u2019s net in a highly chaotic fashion that only bears the faintest resemblance to the real-world sport that inspired it. The premise is simple to pick up and learn in a matter of seconds, but what\u2019s impressive is how complex it can get as your skill and desire to win grows. Perfecting your power shots, learning to time your dodges, and figuring out how to best make use of on-field item pickups are all ways to make you a master out on the pitch. After a few hours of practice, it begins to feel similar to a well-tuned fighting game, where every action has a natural counter to it and each match becomes a test of your reflexes and ability to read your opponents\u2019 intentions. That level of balance and depth is pleasantly surprising for what looks like a minigame you might find in Mario Party at first glance. Mario Strikers: Battle League Screenshots 10 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask A good example of that balance is in the ability to tackle enemy players to the ground at any time, immobilizing them for several seconds. That can feel pretty toxic if you\u2019re playing against an especially rude team, and you might even be subjected to the completely awful experience of being repeatedly tackled even when the ball isn\u2019t in your possession. But this scenario has a clever counter-measure: tackling someone who isn\u2019t in the immediate vicinity of the ball grants that team a free item to be used immediately. So if the enemy is playing especially dirty, they\u2019re also arming you with stuff like a bob-omb that can be lobbed back at them or an invincibility star that can give you free reign of the field for several seconds. In order to become a Battle League champion, you\u2019ll need to learn the ins and outs of both those basic soccer techniques like passing, shooting, tackling, and handling the ball, as well as the ridiculous stuff like items and making use of your character\u2019s special abilities and stats. While throwing a turtle shell at someone\u2019s face brings no end of joy, the fundamentals still play a hugely important role in actually getting the ball in the net. For example, learning dodge at just the right moment grants you a short speed boost afterward, whereas getting the timing perfect when charging up your tackles or shots at the goalie makes them more effective \u2013 both of which can be extremely helpful in breaking through your opponents\u2019 defenses. ...the fundamentals still play a hugely important role in actually getting the ball in the net. \u201c The characters you\u2019ve chosen for your team are also an important factor in what you\u2019ll be able to do in the heat of this fight of feet. If you\u2019re playing as Toad, for example, you\u2019ll be extremely fast but will also need to charge up all of your tackles if you want any hope of being able to take the ball away from someone beefy like Bowser. If you play as Donkey Kong on the other hand, you\u2019ll be a face-slapping machine but also much slower. If a character doesn\u2019t feel exactly the way you want them to, you can even buy gear with the coins you\u2019ve earned from playing to augment their stats to be better in the areas you care about at the cost of being worse in others. Being able to tweak my Mario into a goalie\u2019s worst nightmare with a maxed out Technique stat to curve my shots around them was extremely satisfying, and giving my Toad a full loadout of strength-enhancing gear so he could easily tackle some of the chunkiest enemies was enormously amusing. Plus, the gear actually changes each character visually, and dressing Rosalina up like she\u2019s straight out of Tron just looks cool. The other major difference between characters is their Hyper Strike: a unique ultimate ability that lets you execute an absolutely ridiculous move to score points. These can be activated after picking up a floating orb that spawns on the pitch and include everything from Wario smashing the ball with his stinky butt to Rosalina literally kicking it into outer space until it comes crashing back down to the field \u2013 utter insanity. One of my favorites is Peach\u2019s, who uses her charm to simply make the enemy fall in love with her so the goalie just voluntarily tosses the ball into his own net. Activating one of these moves requires clearing the field of enemy defenders so you can charge up your ability and play a short quicktime event to execute the move, but the risk involved is well worth it. Not only do you get to see a dope cutscene play out, but successfully pulling one off grants your team two points. This is all a lot of fun, but very little of Battle League strays far at all from what we\u2019ve seen in the series before. Not only are all the central mechanics nearly identical to its predecessors on the Gamecube and Wii, but there are also fewer characters than in the past (just 10 total) which seems like an odd move. There\u2019s no story mode or campaign of any kind either, and no game types aside from the standard one you play across every mode. It\u2019s a pretty bare bones package all-in-all, even if that package is extremely replayable. The main offline mode is called Cup Battles, where you enter your team in a routine and extremely brief tournament against computer-controlled opponents with a trophy up for grabs if you can best the enemy. These tournaments are a great way to learn the ropes and build up your skills before playing with friends or in matches online, but they offer few surprises and only minor differences between each of the cups you can enter into \u2013 usually just different AI teams that use slightly tweaked strategies and items from each other. The good news is that some of the later cups offer a greatly increased difficulty for those looking for an increased challenge against the AI, but I wish there was more diversity in what each of the tournaments offer. ...the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight. \u201c Outside of the AI modes, it's pretty impressive that Battle League supports eight players on a single Switch, which makes it the perfect party game. It\u2019s hard to beat the friendship-testing onslaught of dividing a room full of people against one another in a sport so immediately confrontational. That said, it\u2019s a little disappointing that you can only play as one of the four runners on each team while the goalies are always computer-controlled, especially since those goalies are sometimes grossly incompetent and wildly inconsistent in their skill level from moment-to-moment. It would have been nice to let me assign that job to a real human I know I can trust, or can at least direct my rage at. But the biggest improvements Battle League makes over past entries is in its online multiplayer, which lets you join or manage a Strikers Club where you and your friends can compete against other clubs in a ranked playlist and claim seasonal rewards for reaching different divisions. Compared to the very limited online functionality available in the Wii-era Strikers, the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight. In my pre-release time with Battle League, I only briefly got to try out this mode, but so far it seems to have a surprising amount of bells and whistles to sustain a sweaty community of tryhards, which I fully intend to count myself among. My one gripe is that you can only join online matches with two players playing locally on the same Switch, which means you can\u2019t take a full in-person hangout online without multiple systems."

        "Content": "Nathan Hale is having a very bad day. Not only is his star-spangled country rapidly being overrun, but he just got alien blood on his Yankee blue jeans - and dang it - that stuff just won't come out in 1950s-pre-industrial-strength-stain-remover-America. He's also looking a little worse-for-wear himself; pallid skin, bloodshot eyes and a pugilist's nose \u2013 but that's nothing some rhinoplasty can't fix. The invasion, on the other hand? That'll take some elbow grease and a whole lot of ammunition.  Insomniac's second foray into the alternative history world of Resistance 2 proves to be one of the most perfectly rounded shooters available on a console \u2013 certainly the best on the PS3 and regularly a marvel of clever and punishingly hard design. It leaps into new areas shooters rarely aim for \u2013 eight player cooperative gameplay, 60 players online in a single match and a core campaign that boasts impressive scope and a location-hopping, grandiose storyline.  In terms of raw mechanics, Resistance 2 does not innovate, strictly speaking; it's not a game that pushes the mechanics of shooting, defending and advancing farther in any particular way. In fact, without a more refined cover system and a sometimes clunky sprint system, the combat sometimes feels very traditional and routine and therefore somewhat dated, which is a little disappointing. But Resistance 2 does offer is a fullness of options and modes, as well as a finely-tuned single-player experience that manages to impress through sheer polish as much as through its scale and visual variety.    It's also a very thoughtfully designed game on a technical level. While the difficulty ramps up quite a bit, the auto-save locations are mercifully frequent and the AI really does make you pause (making sure you're kneeling behind something, and ever so briefly) to reflect on how aggressive and unrelenting this game becomes. New enemies abound, presenting new airborne, aquatic and landlocked threats. Some, such as the Goliaths (fifteen feet of disturbing brutality and heavy weaponry) act as sub-bosses when they appear in threes and fours. You will die. A lot. Others, such as the swarms of fast moving, zombie-like hybrids that burst out of cocoons flood the screen with enemies and force you to keep on your toes. The game also ramps up the technological foes too \u2013 quadrupedal tanks with several types of weapons come two or three at a time, usually flanked with heavily armed squads of Chimeran foot soldiers. Plasma turrets, strategically positioned, can mow down a whole squad of humans with a single, sustained burst and must be dealt with indirectly, forcing you to think through the best flanking manoeuvre.  Thankfully, you won't be going into battle with pea-shooters and potato-guns; those projectile fetishists at Insomniac continue to push their weapons into strange, new places in Resistance 2. This time, in addition to a few returning weapons and grenades, upgraded versions of both the Auger and the Bullseye soon become your standard weapon of choice in the campaigns. The Marksman is a fantastic new addition to the collection too \u2013 a medium-distance assault rifle that fires three rounds in quick succession and featuring a secondary fire mode that fires out an electrified orb that zaps enemies around it. The Splicer fires out spinning blades of death or can be used, rather unnecessarily, as a melee weapon (though, your standard melee attack is practically as effective). A Magnum revolver with explosive-laden rounds is also excellent, but rare. The LAARK Rocket launcher now sports a secondary mode that fires out a swarm of micro projectiles \u2013 perfect for taking down a cloud of enemies or providing heavy suppression during a critical moment. Two other heavy weapons - a heavy-duty chain gun and a plasma cannon - round out the list, alongside sniper rifles, shotguns and all manner of things that go bickety-bam .   You will learn to hate those giant jerks. The Auger, on the other hand, is possibly the best weapon ever.  Visually, as well as in terms of level design and mission structure, Halo comparisons immediately spring to mind (the first Halo, we should point out \u2013 not the arguably unfocussed and compromised sequels). The AI-driven, squad-based combat and open, varied playing fields harkens back to those first critical steps towards an open battlefield; in Resistance 2, the scope and spread is enormous as you press back the Chimera in open canyons, through the streets of Chicago and its surrounding residential suburbs, through pine forest thickets or wading through waist-high flood water and over scenic ridges as storm clouds roll in, threatening torrential downpour. There's a naturalistic beauty to Resistance 2's original graphics engine \u2013 and critically, a use of a colour spectrum that consists of more than browns, beiges and muted earthy tones.  As the story shifts and things get more interesting (or convoluted, as might actually be the case), dirt and wood and cinderblocks eventually give way to steel, rubber, diffused glows and ornately designed alien technologies that are perfectly offset against the 1950s aesthetic. This is now formula for the series \u2013 and the overall design work continues to impress with its scale, if not the most cutting edge technologies at play. Enemy animations, however, are roundly fantastic; boss characters - enormous insectoid creations with numerous limbs, incredible joint articulation and musculature simulation - all look fantastically menacing. The microdetailing on some surfaces is remarkable too \u2013 small plant growth on the redwood forest floor, for instance.   The fractured narrative jumps around a little too much. Nathan Hale remains mostly unremarkable as a character \u2013despite some intrinsic changes to his persona as the story progresses, and a larger speaking role. This emotional distance between player and character falls on a lack of incidental storytelling in the game; the only time we really see Hale is during moments of critical storytelling. A few sequences of quiet reflection or some sort of inner monologue would've added some much needed personality and human insight to his character \u2013 which, in turn, would make players actually give a damn. Regardless, Resistance 2 still succeeds in holding the story's central threads together enough to provide motivation through the campaign. Again, it's not prizewinning storytelling, but it's a fun, disposable romp from end to end.  This is also a punishingly hard game at times, even on the standard difficulty. A lot of trial and error is required in some areas, and a dedication to using your weapons and limited munitions in a strategic way is something to be applauded. You're never inundated with ammo, and grenades remain a precious commodity. The end result is an adventure that actually plays out much more like Dragon's Lair \u2013 perfecting your path through an essentially linear experience while dying over and over and over again in the process. It can be maddening, but this challenge really creates a beautiful feeling of accomplishment that few shooters muster. Half-life 2 was one; Resistance 2 certainly stands proudly alongside in this regard; you're challenged \u2013 never pandered to.  Smoke effects and environmental detail has greatly improved since the first Resistance: Fall of Man.  Scripted events are genuinely memorable \u2013 the game shifts gears and speed more often than a rally driver.  Pressing through the flooded streets of Chicago, for instance, sees you leaping over Chimera-infested waters one minute, diving to cover from a volley of fire across the street another. Still further in, the location takes on a horror movie quality to the dilapidated, pitch black halls of ruined hotels. With your small but effective torch pushing back the darkness, you just know that whatever is thumping away on the floor above you is hungry, angry and waiting. That, dear reader, is called atmospheric perfection \u2013 the combination of pace, limited resources and dead-on presentation \u2013 and this is not easy to achieve.  A thoughtful experience system and unlockable secrets are married to the multiplayer and cooperative experience. These two areas make up the other half of the Resistance 2 package \u2013 and these cement Insomniac's effort as one of extraordinary long-term value. If you're not much of a social gamer \u2013 and that's probably a lot of you \u2013 you won't be punished for the occasional dabble in multiplayer. Traditionally, the experience and rank that you achieved in multiplayer stood on its own; a testament to your skill in the competitive arena and a literal badge of honour. However, if you joined the scene too late, it seemed like you were constantly struggling against players with better equipment and more applicable skills than yourself \u2013 even within the constraints of matchmaking. In Resistance 2, Insomniac addresses this imbalance by allowing you to play through the game and accrue experience points and earned 'Berserk' skills through both versions of the core campaign, so that when you're ready, you can tackle the online community.  On the subject of cooperative gameplay in Resistance 2, as you may have heard, operates in a separate parallel campaign entirely, trimmed of cutscene but heavy on action. For eight players playing over the net, this mode is an absolute riot, thanks to scaling difficulty and the need to really take advantage of your class distribution. There are three classes to choose from \u2013 and from experience, you really need to keep a balance of all three on hand to make it through the campaign alive. The soldier is your heavy-arms class, with access to improved armour, rounds and sights. The spec-ops character is about distance attacking, grenades and indirect fire with weapons like the Auger. Then there's the medic class \u2013 or, as we like to think of them, the 'cheap' class that you get your inexperienced buddy to play as. You see, of all three classes, the medic class keeps things nice and simple \u2013 you shoot the enemy with your 'medic gun' and you gain health. You basically can't die. You can also transfer health to your allies with its secondary attack. For more detailed information on the specifics of each class, head to one of our numerous previews . In brief though, as long as you have a medic on your side, co-op is fantastic \u2013 and the auto-balancing AI keeps things interesting and fresh.   Multiplayer remains brilliant fun - and with 60 players at once, it's also insanely chaotic by the end of the round.  In terms of competitive multiplayer, Skirmish mode is the big drawcard in Resistance 2. This is the much touted 60 player multiplayer mode that pits ten squads of six against each other as they work their way towards an objective point. Eventually, the squads diverge and all-out chaos takes over. It's brilliant fun, with no noticeable lag and just enough differentiation between insignias and squads to keep things from getting completely out of control. To be perfectly honest, more players doesn't always mean a better experience. That said, Insomniac's real achievement \u2013 and perhaps the biggest accomplishment in the entire game \u2013 is presenting a new way of handling massive battles such as this, with careful integration of leaderboards and MyResistance.net community-oriented features too.   The flaws in Resistance 2 are few and far between \u2013 however, there are some, and they're certainly worth mentioning. For one, no offline multiplayer beyond the dedicated co-op campaign is disappointing. We still think that sometimes a four-player split-screen experience between friends around a TV can be far more satisfying than online. The trend lately is to cater almost exclusively to online services \u2013 but not everyone has a net connection \u2013 and nobody likes being cussed out by a pimply teenager sitting in his grandmothers' basement in Milwaukee.  The narrative suffers from middle-story syndrome to some degree \u2013 the ending offers only some degree of closure but heavily hints at Resistance 3. Those collecting the secret intelligence briefcases will find that reading the contents will fill in a lot of gaps.  Linearity isn't a dirty word, but there comes a point where you realise that you must confront situations in just such a way, you will take damage no matter what, and trial-and-error is sometimes the only way to progress in these instances. These moments point towards strange balancing and design decisions that will occasionally raise an eyebrow or two in baffled frustration.   I think I remember this scene in Predator. It didn't end well for the human.  Finally, and perhaps most subtly, it becomes a little too easy to forget that this is a game rooted in 1950s alternate history. Whereas in the original Resistance, the English setting afforded a certain air to the setting thanks to some classic set pieces and objects, the United States is covered with alien wares and most weapons are pseudo-sci-fi now. Combat suits are a little too modern and overall the effect downplays the game's original trump card \u2013 the kitschy, dated time period. This isn't an overt problem \u2013 and you might disagree with our wanting of downgraded weapons or vehicles for the sake of authenticity. But conceptually, Resistance 2 suffers for not feeling quite as '50s' as it should. "

        "Content": "Editor's Note: This review is only for the multiplayer side of Disintegration. Check out the Disintegration single-player review for our thoughts on the campaign, and check back for our final overall review soon.   At the metal heart of Disintegration\u2019s multiplayer is an interesting idea: a first-person shooter that blends aerial vehicle combat with real-time strategy tactics. It\u2019s a great pitch, but that concept doesn\u2019t seem to live up to its exciting potential in practice. Disintegration is undoubtedly different from any other competitive FPS out there, but the novelty of zipping through the sky on a hoverbike eventually gives way to its relatively shallow strategic core.  Each player in this 5v5 squad shooter pilots their own levitating gravcycle while also commanding a small team of AI robotic troops to fight from the ground and directly interact with objectives. But with guns bolted to your ride, you\u2019ll act as both soldier and general, having to simultaneously engage in firefights while directing your team to support you, adding an extra layer of decisions to make during each encounter.   The first-person floating and shooting can be jarring to even the staunchest FPS player, but the controls are straightforward enough that it only took me a couple of rounds to get a hang of sky surfing. That said, it\u2019s made more complex when you consider that there are nine different types of cycles to choose from, all with their own set of generally familiar weapons and maneuverability quirks to learn. Shotguns, for example, have that recognizable boom, but lack the recoil and devastating bite featured in most contemporary shooters \u2013 presumably because it\u2019s mounted to a flying metal death machine and shooting other armored death machines.  I\u2019ve come to really like zooming around Disintegration\u2019s three maps. They feature plenty of tall structures to weave between and low overhangs to dip under and over when you\u2019re trying to lose a pursuer. Faster gravcycles feel especially fun to blaze around in, as the speed really ramps up the pressure during some tougher chases. Oddly, though, the selection of slower, tankier gravcycles don\u2019t always feel more durable, and in my limited time with them often felt more like a liability than a force to be reckoned with.  The one-button command system is intuitive, but your options are extremely limited. \u201c  While you\u2019re chasing enemy hovercraft and dancing around oncoming fire, you\u2019ll also need to issue commands to your ground units. This team features three or four robotic companions who range between balanced, assault rifle-wielding Warriors to heavy-duty Tanks that run headlong into the fight for melee attacks. Disintegration\u2019s one-button contextual pinging system does an adequate job of intuitively issuing orders at a moment\u2019s notice, but your tactical options are also extremely limited when compared to something like a traditional real-time tactics game. Telling all of them to focus on an enemy, move to a designated spot, or interact with an objective is pretty much the extent of your control outside of a few activatable abilities.  In the most hectic of matches, it can become overwhelming to trade fire in the sky while also giving effective directions to my ground squad. Keeping them safe rarely felt possible, as I was often too busy sparring directly with enemy pilots to get them behind cover. Their unique abilities, like tossing disorienting stun grenades or doing big damage in a large area with a mighty ground slam, are very useful against enemy crews, but they largely won\u2019t affect their pilots. And since killing a pilot also kills their henchmen, aiming for anything that isn\u2019t the floaty, shooty thing in front of me feels like a waste of time and resources.  Disintegration Gameplay Screenshots 22 Images  Before each match, you select a \u201ccrew\u201d that dictates the stats and weapons of your cycle, the abilities of your squad, and your snazzy dress code. Gravcycle loadouts from crew to crew are satisfyingly diverse: putting on the pink and black leather of the Neon Dreams means you\u2019ll be cruising through the arena with vehicle handling as sharp as your outfits, and its dual light machine guns and single-shot stun gun really spoke to me, as well. By contrast, the blue and orange King\u2019s Guard are literal armored knights whose gravcycle features a charged bolt that is slow to fire but does big damage and slows enemies unfortunate enough to be hit by it.  I wish the aesthetics went beyond just color schemes and costumes, though. When you get into the action, all of the voice lines and sound effects are the same generic one-liners no matter who you\u2019ve picked. Looking at The Sideshows, a crew full of killer clowns a la Twisted Metal\u2019s Sweet Tooth, you would expect some fringe, Joker-fied quips to match, or maybe circus music to accompany their rapid-fire sticky grenades. Disintegration does the rest of a crew\u2019s aesthetic so well that it\u2019s disappointing and a bit jarring to see this part missing.  Retrieval is the only mode that fully embraces what makes Disintegration unique. \u201c  Of its three competitive game modes, I\u2019ve had the most fun with Retrieval. One team of attackers must grab explosive cores and take them to designated goals while defenders work to prevent that from happening. It\u2019s the only time online where I felt incentivised to use my squad as more than just a ball of guns, as only they can carry the cores from point to point. Escorting them to the goal is properly tense, and the white-knuckle skirmishes that break out around core carriers is always engaging. Retrieval is similar in design to modes from several other online shooters, but the combination of first-person shooting and light RTS tactics really make it feel fresh here. This is the only mode that seems to fully embrace what makes Disintegration so unique.   Microtransaction Reaction  As is standard in today\u2019s online multiplayer environment, additional cosmetic content is available to buy with Credits, Disintegration\u2019s in-game currency. You can earn Credits in two ways: by simply playing matches, or by laying down real-life money. Importantly, nothing you buy will affect gameplay in any way.  The rate at which you earn Credits is slow, at around 100 per match. For reference, the cheapest things you can buy \u2013 dangling gravcycle ornaments called \u201cattachments\u201d \u2013 cost 300. The more substantial stuff, like pilot skins and color schemes for crews, are far pricier, even reaching 1,000 on the highest end of the scale. You\u2019ll need to play a lot of games to fully unlock all the customizable options for your favorite crew without spending money.  Would you spend real money on cosmetic items? Yes Only if they are really cool No Answer See Results  If you do decide to fork over some cash, credit packs come in four varieties: the cheapest is $4.99 for 500 Credits \u2013 the cost of a single, lower-tier paint job for your crew \u2013 while the priciest is $49.99 for 6,100 Credits. That\u2019s enough to get you various cosmetics across a handful of crews.  I didn\u2019t find any of the crew color schemes or pilot costumes moving enough for me to open my wallet, but the reliability of the grind is its own incentive to keep playing and pimp out my favorite rides over time. Either way, there\u2019s no pressure to spend money if you don\u2019t want to.   In contrast, the other two modes, Zone Control and Collector, are your standard FPS fare. In Zone Control, ground teams must occupy a zone without enemy interference to contest it, but there\u2019s no nuanced way to have your troops go in and secure those areas. Without being able to individually set certain troops in defensive positions based on their supposed strengths \u2013 for example, splitting more fragile units up behind different cover points to keep eyes on every approach angle \u2013 things often devolve into pinging your gang into a central killing zone and letting the AI figure it out while pilots hover in a circle shooting at each other. There could be deeper strategy still to learn here, but it doesn\u2019t feel like I have the tools to enable anything more than an all-out brawl when fighting for a control point.  So far matches don\u2019t demand much beyond pulling the trigger. \u201c  In Collector, there seems to be even less strategy, as killing enemies drops \u201cBrain Cans\u201d that need to be physically picked up by your squad to score points. More often than not, Collector games devolve into teams lining up, Revolutionary War-style, and firing into each other until one side breaks and runs. There\u2019s almost no incentive to get creative outside attempting basic flanking maneuvers. I'm sure some of this brutishness is due to the community being young \u2013 time and experience often lead to techniques and play styles that will come to define a game. But so far Disintegration\u2019s multiplayer doesn\u2019t demand much of you outside of pulling the trigger."

        "Content": "When I initially reviewed Rocket League on PlayStation 4 and PC in 2015, and Xbox One in 2016, I gave it an 8.0 for \u201cGreat.\u201d Here\u2019s what I said then: \u201cWhether it\u2019s online casual or ranked matches, no-pressure exhibitions, split-screen local co-op with up to four players, or an intense 36-week season mode, Rocket League is all about getting into the next throttle-pounding match as fast as possible. Unfortunately, servers are still struggling, which means your mileage may vary day-to-day when it comes to online features. But the silver lining is the mostly formidable AI can make even offline matches interesting and tense. The execution of this simple idea is so strong and so engaging that it keeps bringing me back, time and time again, for just one more match.\u201d ( Read the archived original Rocket League review .) Now, nearly three years later and with all the additional updates, features, and new platforms (including the newly launched Nintendo Switch version), Psyonix\u2019s insane formula of rocket-powered cars playing sports has only gotten better with age. The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn\u2019t changed a bit. The rules are simple: two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy, brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. A game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. \u201c But there\u2019s a golden layer of strategy and mechanical depth tucked inside the chaotic mashing of metal. Timing a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick to connect with the ball and send it sailing at a precise angle takes notable skill. Those basics, when coupled with expert teamplay and mind-blowing booster-powered aerial maneuvers, solidify Rocket League as a game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. At launch, the content around that gameplay felt a little barebones. Since then, though, it\u2019s been substantially fleshed out with smart alternate modes that emphasize different skills and add variety. The Snow Day hockey mode substitutes a dense, oversized puck for the bouncier soccer ball; Hoops is a basketball variant emphasizing aerial play; Dropshot is a two-sided floor-breaking mode; and Rumble mode deals out power-ups that disrupt players and influence the ball. It\u2019s all a ton of fun. And of course, the competitive playlist for the traditional 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 shines as the great ladder system Rocket League was missing to bring some-term goals to its pick-up-and-play ease, offering seasonal cosmetic rewards and bragging rights as you try to climb through the ranked tiers. Decisions, Decisions Overall, Rocket League remains a balanced multiplayer playing field. While the mechanical differences between the free cars and the large assortment of paid-for downloadable cars are noticeable, they\u2019re barely relevant. Sure, some cars turn slightly faster, some have better hitboxes for flipping, but these small differences only really matter at the highest levels of competition, where a few modest purchases don\u2019t seem like too much to ask. The cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. \u201c Serious players have their go-to speedsters, but even with the continuous influx of brand-associated cars you can purchase and use, you\u2019re still totally effective on the field. That\u2019s a list that includes the Batmobile, a DeLorean, and the platform-exclusive cars like the Mario/Luigi-mobile, Halo's Warthog, or Sweet Tooth's ice cream truck. Meanwhile, the cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. With everything from customizable goal explosions to player banners, there are innumerable combinations that allow you to truly stand out, and almost all of it can be earned just by playing. There\u2019s some grinding, sure, but you\u2019re always rewarded, and even duplicate items can be stacked up and traded in for items of better quality using a rudimentary crafting system that adds another layer to the appeal of collecting cosmetics. And yes, Rocket League does come with loot crates that you earn for playing online matches (roughly one every 10 hours of play), but here they\u2019re used relatively inoffensively and can be completely toggled off in the options menu when setting up a game. You can't purchase them with real money, so there's no real pay-to-win element \u2013 especially since these items don't actually do anything other than make you look rad. Instead, they're more like optional rewards you get for grinding out online matches that you can open if you decide to spend $1.50 for a key (or $1 each if you buy in bulk). If you don\u2019t want to spend money at all, you can still get at the contents of these boxes by participating in special, limited-time events that award you keys just for playing more Rocket League. Your Platform Mileage May Vary The sheen on Rocket League\u2019s sleek, neon-coated look varies by platform. On everything but Switch, it runs from the standard 1080p all the way up to 4K on PS4 Pro and PC right now. (4K and HDR support is confirmed to be coming soon to Xbox One X.) Visually, you can\u2019t really go wrong with any version, since Psyonix has made efforts to ensure that you\u2019re always getting 60 frames per second in one- and two-player local splitscreen game modes on most maps. But maintaining that frame rate comes at a price on the Switch, which runs a resolution of around 526p in handheld, and 720p while docked. Blown up on a decently sized TV, you can easily see a lot of rough, jagged lines and edges, both during matches and even in menus, and missing visual effects in arenas. That said, in handheld mode it\u2019s incredibly cool to be able to play Rocket League no matter where you are in a portable enough form that beats the hell out of carrying a laptop and a controller around. But the small screen in portable mode makes it difficult to be as precise, and I regularly found I had a harder time nailing those precise angles that become second nature over time. And that becomes much worse when trying to play local split-screen on the Switch in tabletop mode - half of a small screen is almost comical. While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go \u2013 which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode \u2013 the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent on all platforms."

        "Content": "I really wanted to love Salt and Sacrifice, and for a little while, I did. As the sequel to one of my favorite soulslikes, Salt and Sanctuary , it hit all of the buttons I had hoped it would: challenging combat, a huge variety of grotesque and intimidating enemies, fun boss fights, and an expansive world to explore. But there\u2019s a monster-sized twist to Salt and Sacrifice\u2019s gameplay formula: It introduces Monster Hunter -like elements, complete with repeatable boss hunts, roaming area bosses, and exhausting chases of your targets through gigantic zones. It\u2019s a risky experiment, and one that doesn\u2019t quite pay off. Right out of the gate, Salt and Sacrifice doesn\u2019t initially seem all that different from its 2016 predecessor. It still has that signature gloomy and grim Ska Studios flavor, though all of the hand-drawn art and animations have been completely redone for the better; the tutorial borrows heavily from the Dark Souls school of teaching you the bare minimum, then crushing your spirit with a tutorial boss that\u2019s technically possible to beat, but you\u2019re not really supposed to; and combat maintains a very quick pace despite being tied to a fairly strict stamina meter that highly discourages button mashing. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask These bits that Salt and Sacrifice inherits from Salt and Sanctuary are its strongest points. There\u2019s a ton of playstyle customization thanks to a wide variety of different weapons types; combat is deep, satisfying, and impactful; the zones are fun to explore with meaningful rewards tucked away in hard-to-reach areas; there\u2019s a refreshingly easy to initiate co-op mode; and several options for PVP as well. The bits that Salt and Sacrifice inherits from Salt and Sanctuary are its strongest points. \u201c But the two games are actually very different on a fundamental level. Instead of having one continuous map, Salt and Sacrifice is actually split up into five zones, each of which are enormous and sprawl out in every direction, with progression through them primarily gated by doors that only open when you devour a certain amount of named Mage hearts. You do this by initiating Mage Hunts, which are Monster Hunter-esque boss fights that have you chasing down a particular Mage all throughout the map, engaging it in several small skirmishes until it eventually settles into its proper boss arena, at which point you\u2019re locked into a traditional boss fight. It all looks fine on paper, but in practice, this blending of Monster Hunter, Metroidvania, and  Soulslike is a far from perfect mix. For one, you\u2019re never given a map. Just to reiterate, these zones are huge , often with entire sublevels that take place above ground, underground, in large castles, and in the skies. Trying to chart a path back to the boss you were fighting, the salt resource you dropped after dying, or the locked door that you\u2019re now able to open is far more frustrating than it needs to be. Sure, Salt and Sanctuary didn\u2019t have a map either (I also wish it did), but its absence matters less in that game because its levels are much more linear in their design. E3 2021 Screens - Salt and Sacrifice 9 Images To add on to that, while there are plenty of checkpoints in the form of obelisks that act as respawn and restock stations, there\u2019s no way to fast travel between them or even choose which one you want to start at when you first go from the main hub to a zone, which amounts to lots of retracing your steps through the same enemies, the same traps, the same platforming challenges over and over again, which gets very repetitive. Then there are the mage hunts themselves, which come with their own set of drawbacks. The final phases when you actually fight the boss in their walled-off arena are generally pretty fun. They can  feel overwhelming when you first encounter them \u2013 but after a few attempts, you start to see the openings for you to dodge, block, or attack, making them regularly land in that sweet spot of being difficult but manageable. What Should We Start Calling Games That Are Like Monster Hunter? Monster Hunter-Likes Hunter Gatherers Action Craft-em-ups Nothing, the compartmentalization of video games is one of the worst things to ever happ... Other. Tell us in the comments Answer See Results It\u2019s the chases that are the problem. The big issue is that you never know what else is going to be there when a Mage decides to teleport to an area. I often found myself having to contend with two Mages at once, or a Mage that just camped a ledge and made it nearly impossible for me to get to where I needed to go, or a mage that would spawn extremely tough and durable enemies in an area that was already full of extremely tough and durable enemies. Mercifully, damage persists on Mages while you\u2019re chasing them so you don\u2019t go back to square one when you die, but the bummer is that you have a limited amount of restorative items. On a few occasions I found myself spending 20 to 30 minutes chasing a Mage around the map, exhausting my resources to the point where I only had a few attempts before I completely drained myself of healing flasks by the time I reached the actual boss fight. I would have to quit out of the hunt, farm more flasks, and then do the whole thing over again. Salt and Sacrifice ended up taking me 25 hours to complete, and far too much of that first run was spent retracing steps, farming materials that felt like they should just replenish at a checkpoint, and battling bosses that I had already beaten three or four times before. You never know what else is going to be there when a Mage decides to teleport to an area. \u201c On the plus side, at least the five levels are fun to explore. They are each very visually distinct; they all have an incredible amount of enemy variety, with few if any repeated enemies across them; there are a large handful of Mages to find and hunt; hidden treasures that are well off the beaten path are fun to find, as well as hidden NPCs that will return to the hub once you find them and offer some sort of helpful shop or multiplayer function. Embracing the Grind The good news about the Monster Hunter influence in Salt and Sacrifice is that if you\u2019re the kind of person that welcomes the grind and doesn\u2019t mind the extra repetition of beating the same bosses multiple times, there\u2019s a very satisfying progression of loot that awaits you. Just like how every monster in Monster Hunter has their own specific set of craftable weapons and armor you can make from their remains, so too are there unique weapon and armor sets for every Mage you defeat. I always looked forward to going back to the hub and checking out the new weapons and armor I could craft after downing one. Most weapons gained from Mages also come with unique skills that add fun new facets to combat. My trusty half-spear that I got from killing a Chronomancer gifted me with the ability to place down a pillar that would slow down time for anything that walked within it, along with the ability to call upon spectral blades that would slice up anything in a large range above me, which proved to be incredibly useful. Using these skills did require some pivoting on the skill tree to adjust my build, but fortunately you\u2019re given a limited number of respec points every couple of levels that allow a great amount of flexibility when it comes to customizing your character. There are also hidden tomes throughout each zone that unlock Fated Mage hunts, which are repeatable hunts that can be used to hunt specific Mages in order to collect the upgrade or crafting materials that you need. I felt like I had my fill of repeatable hunts just from the frequency that they\u2019d spawn in world after I killed them once, but again, for those who are all about the grind to complete their armor sets, it\u2019s nice to have the ability to revisit these hunts in a structured way. What saves Salt and Sacrifice from being a skip is its multiplayer options. While you can do the Dark Souls style of cooperation and PVP that\u2019s tied to various in-game items and NPC factions, the real star of the show is the simple cooperation board that allows a host to enter a passcode, have their partner enter the same passcode, and boom they\u2019re playing coop together. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s just such a unique experience to be able to play through a soulslike from beginning to end with a buddy without ever having to jump through any hoops. What saves Salt and Sacrifice from being a skip is its multiplayer options. \u201c It helps too that the implementation of co-op is top notch. There are fun emotes to bring a bit of much needed levity to what\u2019s otherwise an aggressively dark adventure, enemies are scaled to make the challenge still very prevalent even with another body, and the drawn out hunts are much less of a chore when you\u2019re able to do it with a friend. Playing in coop turned instances that would\u2019ve infuriated me as a single player, where I\u2019d get bopped by an extremely hard to see trap, or juggled to death by a boss, into shared moments that I could laugh at with a friend. What We Said About Salt and Sanctuary You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map.

        "Content": "Star Wars Battlefront captures everything I love most about Star Wars. It\u2019s playful and imaginative, driven by a sense of adventure and fun above all else. By embracing this, and improving on the classic original Battlefront, developer DICE has made almost exactly the Star Wars multiplayer shooter I\u2019ve always wanted.  The catch is that this revival comes with baggage, and doesn\u2019t always know what to do with itself.  There is an immaculate attention to detail in Star Wars Battlefront, making it easily one of the best-looking games of the generation. Battlefront's stunning visual fidelity is even stronger on PC thanks to its modifiable settings. Cleaner textures, plus improved lighting and visual effects sell the exceptional aesthetic even better. Battlefront looks, feels, and sounds like the original trilogy in almost every way, from the scorch marks on X-wings to that specific spark and puff of smoke of blaster fire impacts. The incredible audiovisual experience is so convincingly authentic that anything out of place stands out vividly. DICE\u2019s original score, for example, occasionally blends brilliantly with John Williams' original music, but sounds so wrong at times that I frequently turn music off entirely. And at best, the hero character performances and movie one-liners are weird and distracting. At worst, they\u2019re pandering and awful. Aggressive Negotiations DICE puts this great look and feel to use in a messy mountain of modes. Star Wars Battlefront is at peak quality in Supremacy, Walker Assault, and Drop Zone. These are focused, objective-oriented games that leverage a deep set of sandbox systems so that spectacular things never stop happening. Drop Zone is a fast and violent 8v8 race for map domination that rewards quick thinking. Seize control of crashed drop pods and you\u2019ll earn victory points, one-time consumable items like mines and sentry turrets, and trigger the next drop. All of the explosives, heavy weapons, and buffs you unlock over time add to your combat options, too. Every player brings their own customized loadout to every battle, where they can adapt to new roles on the fly. This concoction of different people using varied items creates a beautiful chaos, and it only becomes more impressive as other modes add bigger player counts. Supremacy is the next logical step up from here. It encourages aggressive tactics as two teams of 20 wrestle for outpost control on a large map. The awesome driveable vehicles play a huge role here, with skillfully piloted AT-STs and X-wings able to make or break a match for a struggling team. The infantry combat dynamic shifts drastically when you\u2019re suddenly taking heavy fire from above, driving everybody toward mounted weapons or protected areas. Smart Rockets, Orbital Strikes, and other expendable power-ups appear randomly, and work as great counter-measures when you\u2019re lucky enough to find them. Plus, their explosions are the best. Survival mode is Battlefront\u2019s most unexpected success. \u201c To make rounds even more volatile, you can find pickups that spawn you as hero characters to bring big power to Supremacy and Walker Assault. Luke Skywalker can carve a safe path through stormtroopers for his team, while Boba Fett\u2019s amazing jetpack-powered mobility and deadly blaster is a constant distraction for Rebels. Playing as \u2013 or just watching \u2013 the six available heroes is a major highlight in a multiplayer game, and impressive scenes are inescapable. Plus, each hero has fun new abilities that make them precious. The Emperor\u2019s high burst damage offsets his lack of defensive options, while Princess Leia\u2019s limited but extreme damage justifies her protective shield. Walker Assault mode mixes all of these elements and throws them off balance, giving the Imperials a thematically appropriate advantage as AT-ATs march toward victory. They\u2019re genuinely daunting vehicles, and bringing them down as the Rebels (by first capturing and holding points, then striking the walking tanks at moments of vulnerability) feels like a huge accomplishment. It\u2019s satisfying in a different way than crushing the Rebels with that overwhelming force, but both teams are really fun. Between weapon loadouts, equippable items, vehicles, heroes, tension, tactics, variety, and the massive scale of the maps \u2013 set across Hoth, Endor, Sullust, and Tatooine \u2013 Walker Assault represents everything Battlefront does well. Rebel Assault While there\u2019s no actual single-player campaign, Survival mode is Battlefront\u2019s most unexpected success. The solo or two-player cooperative wave-based missions pit Rebel players against an onslaught of increasingly aggressive Imperials. New enemies with invisibility, jetpacks, extra armor, and shields force you to change the way you react to each assault. It\u2019s especially rewarding on higher difficulties, so skip straight past the cakewalk default mode. Entertaining as these deep, involving missions are, once there aren\u2019t many compelling reasons to replay a Survival mission you\u2019ve finished. Battlefront\u2019s 13 maps are pretty much uniformly excellent. \u201c The remainder of Battlefront\u2019s modes just feel like unfocused filler, or worse. First you\u2019ve got the mediocre fights: Cargo is your usual camp-fest capture-the-flag mode \u2013 a decent change of pace for 12 players, but original in no way. Fighter Squadron is a good training ground for aspiring pilots, and both Slave I and Millennium Falcon are ruthless beasts in the skies, but aerial-only matches neglect a core component of top-tier Battlefront matches -- the excellent effect of infantry on the battlefield -- for a simplistic dogfighting deathmatch. And Blast is such a forgettable team deathmatch variant that I wonder why they even bothered. Then there are few modes I\u2019d go so far as to call bad. Hero Hunt and Heroes vs. Villains have little to offer anyone already enjoying the competitive multiplayer. They\u2019re hectic in a way that\u2019s more confusing than entertaining, and barely in the Battlefront\u2019s spirit of disposable soldiers annihilating each other. The anticlimactic alternative to Drop Zone is Droid Run, a meandering mode that has teams running in circles capturing mobile control points. Matches either end before they can become interesting, or disregard team strategy by making only the last minute matter. Credits Will Do Fine However, even a poor mode benefits from a great map, and the good news is that Battlefront\u2019s 13 maps are pretty much uniformly excellent. Each planet\u2019s gorgeous environments cling to distinct visual and structural themes that make sense for Star Wars. Endor is dense, full of places to hide, and rich with great sniper spots, while Tatooine\u2019s labyrinthian landscape is less predictable, allowing you to catch enemies off guard at any moment. Hoth has patches of extreme claustrophobia across its wide-open, trench-filled fields, which differs dramatically from Sullust\u2019s combination of molten, rocky plains and Imperial technology. This gives each valley, structure, and cave a unique and new sense of dangerous place. The unfortunate side effect of these unlocks is that most arenas suffer from too few assigned spawn points, leading to devious and infuriating spawn-camping opportunities. Proximity mines, infantry turrets, and orbital strikes are particularly maddening to spawn into. This frustration is often made worse by the extremely generous auto-aim on consoles. Landmarks make each map more memorable than their actual designs, but the majority of these arenas are excellent. The best are, true to DICE form, absolutely massive with rich complexity. I\u2019m still finding new routes through certain structures, new hiding spots, and better ways to bait-and-switch opponents. Purchasable unlocks help here, too, particularly the Jump Pack, which lets you boost up or across an area. Battlefront\u2019s infantry game changes in a terrific way when you\u2019re able to boost away from incoming fire, or onto a previously inaccessible vantage point. Equippable items like this come in the form of unlockable Star Cards, which you can equip before each match. They\u2019re varied, allowing for decently deep character customization instead of forcing your hand with class-based combat. You can increase damage resistance with one Star Card, bring a sniper rifle into battle with another, or build an entire loadout around blowing up vehicles. It\u2019s the best way to spend any Credits earned in multiplayer, since the simple cosmetic customization is weirdly way more expensive than unlocking different blasters with varying range/fire rate/damage output."

For every success like Call of Duty , Halo , or Apex Legends , it seems like there are at least a dozen other games that have come and gone with barely a spark before they fizzle. With so many good competitive shooters in play, what makes one stand out? After dozens of hours I\u2019m beginning to see how The Finals answers those questions: with an excellent gameshow-infused style and a brilliantly destructible playground. If the 1987 movie The Running Man  were about 3v3v3 gun battles, it would\u2019ve resembled The Finals. You and two teammates face off against other three-person squads in a virtual gameshow, vying to see who can be the first to score enough cash before time runs out. The vibrant color palette combines with a pair of live sports-style play-by-play announcers to give it that over-the-top, American Gladiators feel that people in the \u201880s thought was going to be the future of sports. That strikes a great balance of not taking itself too seriously without making it a total joke or becoming obnoxious. The Finals Review Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There are currently two main modes: the first, Quick Cash, has each team vying to collect a vault of coins and deposit it at a designated  spot on the map, which tends to result in the bloody convergence of all three squads at those points. This really effectively keeps the action going, and because taking over the deposit doesn\u2019t reset its progress, rounds move at a steady pace and avoid momentum-killing stalemates altogether. Meanwhile the Bank It mode focuses a bit more on direct PvP battles, but they also tend to be more scattered. Here, each player carries coins in their virtual pockets, all of which is gathered either from vaults around the map or by eliminating enemies. The on-the-fly strategizing of going for kills one second and then needing to deposit your loot before it all goes to waste the next is exciting, and it\u2019s pretty fun to eliminate someone right in front of the bank so you can deposit all their coins yourself. Quick Cash really effectively keeps the action moving. \u201c Individually, both modes are well designed and generally very fun. The fact that The Finals is limited to just those two options, however, is a red flag. If the player base starts to grow tired of these game types and there aren\u2019t any other options, there is a real possibility of people moving on before too long. While I didn\u2019t find that to be an issue during my time playing, that does present a potential concern for the long-term health of this community that I hope is addressed with new modes in future updates. Once you\u2019ve played a few matches you\u2019ll unlock tournaments, and this is where the competitive attitude of The Finals really shines. The primary tournament mode puts you and seven other teams in a bracket playing modified versions of Cashout. Two games of four teams each run simultaneously, with the top two squads from each game advancing to the second round. The top two teams from that game then face off in a direct 3v3 match to determine the overall winner. It does a great job mixing the high stakes nature of an actual competition with rounds that are fast and satisfying enough to elicit that \u201cjust one more game\u201d feeling after each tournament.

The Light build, for example, focuses on mobility, trading stopping power for a grappling hook to quickly get to high or far places. The Medium, meanwhile, is an all-arounder, and has abilities that focus on support, such as its healing beam. Finally, there\u2019s the Heavy, which could have been taken straight from Rainbow Six: Siege, as it alternates between controlling the battlefield with heavy weapons and smashing through walls like the Juggernaut. There\u2019s a solid variety of equipment for you to choose from before each match, and they can have a major impact on the battlefield if used properly. There are standard choices, like frag grenades and deployable cover, and those are tried and true options that do what you\u2019d expect \u2013 but they hardly stand out when you can instead drop jump pads that launch you high into the air, or goo grenades that can seal large spaces with an expanding foam. Some options are universal, like the pyro grenades, while others are restricted to specific classes, like the Medium builds\u2019 defibrillator that instantly revive downed teammates. Hopefully future updates can even the balance out. \u201c Those choices are undermined, however, as balance issues are a bit of a concern at the moment. Heavies tend to be ubiquitous in competitive modes, and their huge health pool and high damage output makes it easy to see why. Certain weapons like the flamethrower, grenade launcher, and sword seem to make up an outsized portion of the player arsenal I\u2019ve come across as well. Hopefully future updates can even things out, but as it is, a lightweight build with the semi-automatic battle rifle, for example, really struggles to compete with the rest of the meta, and that\u2019s a shame. Each character archetype also has a litany of cosmetics that can be unlocked through XP progression or by spending real world money. There\u2019s a pretty solid assortment to choose from right out of the gate, though the amount of time it takes to unlock good looking items (without taking out your wallet) is in need of major retuning. After 20 hours, the best I could afford was some fanny packs and tights on one character, which makes getting the whole squad glammed up feel like a pipe dream. That slow progression is also true of VRs, the in-game \u201ccash\u201d you earn for playing that\u2019s used to unlock non-cosmetic things like different abilities, weapons, and gadgets. I get that there needs to be a balance between giving you everything too soon, which can take away the joy of progression, and making it take too long to earn things, but right now The Finals skews a bit too much towards the latter. It\u2019s hard to experiment with builds when all the pieces for each character are locked behind dozens of hours of matches. Multibucks are the paid premium currency, and the cosmetic items that can only be purchased with them are the right mix of being unique enough to consider, but not necessary for folks who don\u2019t want to spend the money. They are the flashiest items by far, and include things like an Elvis-style jumpsuit in the paid battle pass, or gold skins for your weapons you can buy outright. Importantly, nothing restricted to Multibucks offers a competitive advantage, so there\u2019s no pay to win option \u2013 especially since VRs can only be earned through playing. None of the premium stuff is essential either, with the possible exception of the tin-foil hat wearing Conspirakitten that can ride your shoulder into battle. That\u2019s just too adorable to pass up. The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. \u201c The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. Sure, you can enter a room from the door or window. But taking the less obvious path of crashing right through the ceiling is a thrilling way to get the drop on unsuspecting teams, and you haven\u2019t really played The Finals until you\u2019ve stolen the vault by blowing a hole in an upper floor and had it drop right in front of you. By the end of a tense match, the battlefield is often littered with debris from entire buildings beginning to collapse. There\u2019s a lot more to that system than some cool rubble and an ad hoc door, too, as the strategic impact is huge. One map is high atop skyscrapers connected by sky bridges, and I sat in stunned silence the first time I saw a team destroy the section where a bridge met a building, causing the entire thing to collapse to the ground below. Split second judgment calls when buildings fall around you about whether to jump off or ride the debris down can make or break firefights and create unforgettable moments \u2013 like when my entire team was dead in the final seconds of a match, and the only thing that stopped another team from stealing the bank for the win was the amount of rubble they had to dig through to reach it.

There\u2019s nothing to be gained by ignoring objectives and going for straight kills, so teammates tend to do a good job being focused on the task, making solo play very viable. It does have one glaring weakness, however: in matches where I either didn\u2019t get grouped into a full three-person team, or someone left mid-fight, people were rarely pulled into our team to refill our ranks. It\u2019s very disheartening to be in a match by yourself, knowing you have no shot at winning and no reason to hold out hope that help is going to arrive. There will always be an element of luck in the quality of teammates you are matched with, which is a big part of why The Finals (as with most team-based shooters) is better across the board with people you know. It\u2019s so much fun to coordinate an assault with friends, or to seize the bank and then protect it with mines and defensive structures. It\u2019s also a huge advantage to work together. A flamethrower wielding Heavy supported by a healing beam from a Medium can wipe an entire team, and the strategic element of choosing complimentary builds and kits is very engaging. When someone dies, they leave an action figure behind that can be used to revive them, and scooping one up so you can find a safe place to bring them back is as useful as it is hilarious. (Crossplay and progression also made it quite nice to be able to bounce back and forth between different friends on my PC and Xbox Series X without missing a beat.)"

        "Content": "There is a stretch of time during which every adolescent male is obsessed with posters. I have vivid memories of being dropped off at the mall with my friends, where we would scour the two or three stores with the best selections. We argued endlessly about which comic book characters, rock stars and supermodels were worth putting on our bedroom walls, but we all agreed on two things. First, the Lamborghini Countach was f**cking awesome, and anyone who didn't have a poster of it was a total loser. Second, we all wanted to be military pilots. And we came to the conclusion that the easiest way to get started was to buy totally sweet posters of F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18s and stare at them while pretending to do our homework.  Videogames like Ace Combat: Joint Assault exist because that sort of jet craziness never really goes away. If you think airplanes are just big hunks of boring metal, you'll probably never change your mind. But if you think they're cool as hell, you always will. The problem is, it's tough to bring the excitement, complexity and drama of piloting military aircraft to the masses. Games that attempt to simulate the experience risk jettisoning the fun. Those that focus squarely on fun often lose the sense of realism that makes these planes interesting in the first place.   Bring a friend.  The Ace Combat series has always been more about exciting, accessible and sometimes over-the-top aerial action than strict realism, although the latest installment, Ace Combat: Joint Assault, tries to paint a coat of authenticity over its whimsy by using actual cities such as Tokyo, San Francisco and London as settings. It's a good idea in theory, but it doesn't add much to the typical Ace Combat experience.  They serve mainly as backdrops and have no real ties to the individual missions. At one point I was assured London was burning, which, although tragic, sounded like a cool thing to see. Unfortunately, it just looked like a pile of brownish blocks that were not on fire.  \"Real world\" settings are one of the big selling points for Joint Assault, the follow-up to 2006's Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception. The others are an \"enhanced combat\" view that zooms in on your plane when you accelerate and a host of co-operative and competitive online multiplayer modes. For me, the latter is the only real reason to pick up Ace Combat: Joint Assault. The campaign missions are repetitive and rather dull, the voice acting is hilariously bad, and the storyline is nonsensical. If you can believe it, the main story revolves around insurance. That's right, insurance. If there's a more boring subject for a game about multi-million-dollar attack aircraft, please let me know in advance so I can bring a pillow.   This guy knows what I'm talking about.  The multiplayer is where Joint Assault comes to life. Gather a group of friends over via ad-hoc or infrastructure mode and choose to co-operate in the campaign missions (up to four players) or face off in the competitive mode (up to eight players). Joint Assault's campaign missions have multiple branches that can be tackled simultaneously with other players. What's more, in many missions, the outcome of one player's objective will have an effect on another's. Cool, right?  The multiplayer options in Joint Assault are plentiful. You can limit invitees by rank, share career data back and forth, set mission parameters and create teams in Vs. modes. If you get a solid group of friends together with multiple copies of Joint Assault, you're in for some serious stick time.  But if you're going to be playing solo, there's just not that much to get excited about in Ace Combat: Joint Assault. Sure, you can unlock dozens of planes, emblems, weapons and paint jobs as you make your way through the missions. But most of the missions are uninspired and cheap. \"Oh, no! The giant flying fortress that's firing Electro Laser Cannons also has 12 anti-aircraft guns on it! Let's take them all out! Awesome, we took them all out! Wait, why did they all come back again? Let's destroy them again and hope they don't come back! S**t, they came back again!\" You get the idea.  Aside from a few cool moments like unlocking the F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber, and, oddly, flying a persnickety executive around in an unarmed jumbo jet, there was nothing about this pocket pilot game that got me all that excited about flying. Given the choice between buying Ace Combat: Joint Assault (to play alone) and an equally priced bundle of airplane posters, I'd probably choose the latter."

        "Content": "PlayStation All-Stars isn\u2019t Smash Bros. I know that that\u2019s been the popular line since All-Stars was officially revealed , but anyone who\u2019s spent considerable time with both games \u2013 and I have \u2013 will identify almost instantaneously the deep-seated fallacy in that line of thinking. Indeed, while PlayStation All-Stars is clearly inspired by what Nintendo has done with its famous brawler, the comparisons end on the periphery. Smash Bros. is its own thing, its own unique take on heavily competitive, fun and accessible multiplayer madness. It totes a well-earned legacy because it\u2019s a phenomenal series. PlayStation All-Stars, on the other hand, is a bona fide fighting game, and its maiden foray on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita attempts to carve out its own, more technical niche. The game\u2019s developer, SuperBot Entertainment, was specifically created to make this game, and the team \u2013 with some help from Sony Santa Monica -- succeeded in making a fun mash-up catered to the legions of PlayStation fans out there. It may, however, struggle to find an audience outside of the PlayStation core, not because it\u2019s a bad game \u2013 it\u2019s quite the opposite \u2013 but because making believers out of skeptics will first require them to play it. At the center of the PlayStation All-Stars experience rests its core of 20 playable characters ( with more on the way as DLC ). These characters run the gamut from the super-popular (Nathan Drake, Kratos) to the up and coming (Sackboy, Cole MacGrath) to the outright obscure (Toro, Fat Princess). There are even awesome nods to dormant Sony-owned franchises (Sir Dan, Nariko) and some third party love as well (Big Daddy, Dante). It\u2019s a well-rounded cast, and while there are some obvious exclusions that frustrate fans of the brand, there\u2019s something here for anyone who loves PlayStation. Due mostly to the pedigree of some of the development veterans on SuperBot\u2019s staff, PlayStation All-Stars plays more like a fighting game than you may expect, and is more complicated, nuanced and technical than Smash Bros. With the exception of Good Cole MacGrath and Evil Cole MacGrath, no two characters play alike to the point where they\u2019re considered outright palette swaps. All-Stars comes packing considerable depth, one of the major things that helps it stand out. This makes running through its roster fun, with differences between characters shining through. One of the best parts about All-Stars, especially early on, is settling on your character of choice through copious experimentation. Like its roster of characters, All-Stars\u2019 stages take a page from PlayStation\u2019s storied history. The game\u2019s 14 standard levels are all mash-ups, taking influences from two entirely separate franchises to create something random and unique. Expect to find something completely out of left field (the Franzea stage borrows from Loco Roco and Metal Gear) or something truly strange (like Invasion, which mixes up Killzone and Ape Escape). And there are different kinds of stage types, too. Alden\u2019s Tower, which combines Infamous and Sly Cooper, is a scrolling level, while Sandover Village, throwing together Jak & Daxter with Hot Shots Golf, is a small, tight stage that forces confrontation. The combinations are strange and outright bizarre. Yet, they also work nicely and call on some franchises \u2013 like Resistance, for instance \u2013 that were ignored when crafting the character roster. Each level is interactive and disruptive during battle, a welcome diversion that freshens up gameplay and forces you to pay attention to more than just your adversaries. For instance, on the Hades level, which crosses God of War with Patapon, the keeper of the underworld can be seen in the back, occasionally smashing the level, eliciting AP loss and temporary paralysis to anyone he strikes. When the Patapon show up later, Hades will become distracted by them, but it won\u2019t stop them from launching arrows on the stage, which must be dodged. Each level in the game has similar features revolving around the series that inspired it, but worry not, because if you want to shut off this interactivity to fight your foes straight-up, you can. Then again, I\u2019d recommend sticking with stage interactivity, as it makes fights more grueling. In battle, All-Stars lacks a conventional health meter, instead relying on AP (All-Stars Points) that give players the chance to execute killing strikes called super attacks. This design decision is the game\u2019s unexpected trump card, the true differentiator between it and other brawlers. The more you play the game, the more obvious it becomes that this was a daring design decision that was smartly made. Supers are split into three tiers, and building up your meter requires you to lay the beatdown on your enemies. All-Stars hinges entirely around effectively building up your own meter to build up your kills while doing everything in your power to dodge your foes\u2019 killing blows. It takes some getting used to, but ultimately, the system works. It\u2019s rewarding, different and, most importantly, enjoyable. Keeping an eye on other players\u2019 meters to try to identify when and how they\u2019ll unleash their supers is incredibly tactical. Interrupting their supers or dodging them outright becomes integral to high level play. Dodge rolling, blocking and evading are just as important as going in for meter-building strikes, even in a game that lacks health. If you choose to dedicate yourself to learning All-Stars\u2019 ins and outs, playing the game becomes an art, one that varies heavily depending on if you\u2019re involved in a four player free for all, a two on two match, or \u2013 my favorite \u2013 a one-on-one match with a three kill limit. Character attacks are mapped to the square, triangle and circle buttons. When combined with analog stick movement, character movesets begin to become truly complicated, giving players a smorgasbord of choice. Such options mean that there isn\u2019t only one way to play a character. Colonel Radec, for instance, can be played at a distance, up close, or with a combination of the two, and any style is viable. Nathan Drake\u2019s firearms are great from afar, but pummeling opponents with melee attacks may be preferable. Either style works. Differentiating characters further are their special abilities, such as Sly\u2019s invisibility or Toro\u2019s access to three distinct setups. Like any true fighting game, All-Stars gives players more choices than any one person will know what to do with. Such complexities play out wonderfully in PlayStation All-Stars, giving gamers something vibrant and deep. All-Stars appears as a pick-up-and-play game, but that\u2019s only a razor thin fa\u00e7ade. Newcomers can have fun with the game, but it\u2019ll take time, patience and practice to truly become competent at it, especially when facing off against high caliber opponents. Depending on who you play, how you play, and in what mode you play, All-Stars varies greatly. As a result, its lack of health meters ironically made it a more complex and tactical game than what came before it and has compounded its depth. Like in any fighting game, there are some balancing issues to deal with \u2013 Kratos generally seems too strong, and Ratchet\u2019s level one super attack is absurdly powerful, for instance \u2013 but SuperBot intends on fixing things on the fly as they learn how players play the game, and hopefully, these issues (and others) will be attended to in short order. All-Stars is split into a series of modes that accommodate single-player purists but decidedly slant towards those who want to play multiplayer locally or online. There are tutorials, trials and more to keep you busy, but its single-player arcade mode is the meat of the solo experience. It allows gamers to run through a mildly story-driven campaign with each character, culminating in a rivalry-based battle before pitting you against the game\u2019s final boss . The rivalries themselves explore interesting (but shallow) story angles, some more obvious than others. It\u2019s easy to understand why Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank might have an issue with each other, for instance, but you might have to delve a little deeper to make sense of Sackboy\u2019s and Big Daddy\u2019s quarrel. Unfortunately, while playing against the computer in solo mode proves fun, the experience can also become redundant and predictable. I was disappointed during my first play through to see the story told through static images coupled with voiceovers for both a character\u2019s intro and ending, accompanied by a limited, animated take on the rivalry battle itself. This is the same for each character. All-Stars could have used more love in its single-player presentation, even if the campaigns, tutorials and trials act as excellent proving grounds before jumping into multiplayer (and even if there are a flood of unlockables, from icons to cheerleader-like minions and everything in between, to earn). If SuperBot makes a sequel, this is the greatest problem in the game worthy of being fixed.  On the other hand, the multiplayer suite really shines in PlayStation All-Stars. The game is truly a blast when played with friends. Gamers will be given the option to play with up to four players locally or online, mixing and matching PS3 and Vita gamers in just about any permutation you could imagine. Have two players on your PlayStation 3 and want to match up with Vita players online? You can do that. Have three friends over, but only three DualShock controllers and a Vita? All four of you can still play in the same match, sitting in the same room. All-Stars will accommodate you with online or local play in just about any situation, and SuperBot should be applauded for making such a daunting online process spring into existence, especially because, with solid connections, the game works great online using either platform. Whether playing locally or online, you\u2019ll have a plethora of options to customize your experience. You can play with teams, or in a free for all. You can have a point system (with 2 points per kill and minus one point per death) or go with a kill or stock system. You can have a bunch of items turned on, such as Resistance\u2019s Hedgehog Grenade, which stops you from using supers for a short time, or Hermes\u2019 Boots from God of War, which give you extra speed, or you can turn them off. You can mess with the clock, you can turn off any given level\u2019s interactivity, and more. In All-Stars, it\u2019s all about making the experience your own. I especially enjoyed All-Stars\u2019 take on online play in terms of its tournament setup, which puts players through roving seasons, where statistics are kept only for a short time before they\u2019re reset. This lets everyone start on the same playing field and keeps competition perpetual and fair. The online user interface is a bit convoluted \u2013 it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how to play two-on-two online or play coveted one-on-one, either \u2013 but with trial and error, things are simple enough to figure out. And if you want to play online but don\u2019t want to get crazy competitive, you can always stick to unranked matches."

        "Content": "It may not have been a huge commercial hit, but mention the PS2/Xbox racer 'Mashed' to those who discovered its joys and you'll receive an overwhelming response. Mashed (or Drive to Survive as it was known in North America when it eventually came out there) is the very definition of a cult title, and is still spoken about - in certain circles - with reverence.  The game took the Micro Machines gameplay template and brought it into the modern era, and Wrecked picks up where Mashed left off. This game is all about almost-top-down four player same-screen races, where the action is focused on getting ahead of the pack. Drop behind and you're eliminated. Once a single car remains, points are allocated and the race starts again. These mini-battles see players jostling for position and unleashing attacks with the game's many weapons, while the points system meta-game ensures comebacks are always possible. It's classic competitive multiplayer gameplay.  With six courses there's not a huge wealth of content, but there are some real stand-outs. Ice Bridge is the best course in the game by a long way, and is reason enough to buy Wrecked on its own. Inspired by the similarly classic Polar Wharf course from Mashed, it's simplicity itself in design: two long ice-covered straights with hairpins at each end. The slippery handling is sublime, allowing players to jostle and try and knock one another off the drops on each side of the track without ever feeling like they're not in control. Add in shunting (flicking the right stick left or right) and speed boosts (tap brake then double tap accelerate) and the competition is satisfying and unpredictable, with just the right balance of skill and luck. We've been playing Wrecked in the office for the last week or so, and time and again our sessions wind up as Ice Bridge marathons. It's just that satisfying.    The rest of the courses aren't as strong but the other snow and ice-covered course, Arctic Outpost, is great fun and has a truly inspired S bend (even if the camera does fight against it somewhat). That said, tweaking the handling for less grip gives more sedate tracks like Jungle Temples a more satisfying rally-like feel. This is a game that demands players experiment with the settings to find the feel they want. To that end, there are a bunch of different handling options to choose from and plenty of other parameters that can be adjusted.  Most important is the weapons load-out, as there are stacks of weapons in Wrecked. Finding the right blend for each course can make a huge difference to the fun factor. Players can add or remove 14 in all, from mines and machine guns to dual, side-mounted shotguns, mortars, rail guns and beyond. And just because you get temporarily ejected from the race doesn't mean you have to stop competing. Eliminated players are able to use an on-screen reticule to rain fire upon the remaining racers. There are five air strike options to choose from, including homing missiles, sky beams and cannons. They're a bit of a mixed bag, sadly, and some of the more inventive options, such as swapping cars and reversing a player's steering, fall flat. Still, the cannons are satisfying and deadly, and the air strikes are a great way to gang up on someone who's out ahead in terms of points.  Although Wrecked has a decent array of options, there are also some oversights. The inability to add AI cars to a race is a pretty major one. This game really isn't any fun with two players \u2013 it's all about three or four player racing \u2013 so it seems insane that you could have a friend over but not be able to fully populate the races.  Six courses is also pretty paltry, and I can't help but think Supersonic's energies may have been better served fleshing out the multiplayer side of the game with more courses than creating the lacklustre single player component. Why not pillage a couple more classics from the past? Mashed had a fantastic highway course, which \u2013 again \u2013 was all about straights, where players had to weave through traffic at the same time as outracing and outgunning each other. I'd love to see a fresh take on that.  Instead, the team has built a single player challenge mode, and \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 it's entirely forgettable. Four challenges per track await, from time trials and precision driving to dropping mines in marked areas and surviving courses while towing a caravan behind the car. By and large the handling mechanics and camera system (which pans and zooms as you round corners) aren't cut out for adapting the gameplay to these kinds of challenges and it all feels pretty perfunctory. Your mileage may vary, but I just didn't find the single player component in any way engaging. Still, at least these don't have to be played through to unlock the multiplayer courses.  And that's all there is for the solo player. Why not replicate the multiplayer component in solo? Pitting the player against some decent AI would be a valuable option, and would mean we'd be able to mix and match AI in multiplayer too.    Online is present and accounted for, of course, but you'll want to get together in a party to play. Racing against (and trash talking with) friends is where Wrecked is at its best. It's really bare bones, however, and not as functional as local multiplayer. Why I have to back out several steps after each race \u2013 unless I want to replay the current race \u2013 to choose a new course and new settings, is beyond me. Our online tests so far haven't been hugely smooth, either \u2013 even though all the players were in Sydney. It's still playable, but doesn't compare to playing four-player locally.  In other areas Wrecked is serviceable. The visuals are simple but readable, the sound effects decent and the music forgettable. None of this really matters in the heat of multiplayer competition, however. "

The quirky humor and attention to detail found in previous Behemoth games Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers returns in full force, but this time around a lack of gameplay focus brings down the overall package. Anyone can sit down and enjoy BattleBlock Theater, but few will fall in love with it.   All Behemoth games have featured laughs, usually in the form of sight-gags and others jokes lurking beneath the surface. Battleblock Theater brings this humor to the forefront, and it successfully permeates the entire experience \u2013 from the narrator\u2019s manic opening monologue to the multiple songs that play over the end credits. The writing mixes poop jokes with pop-culture references, punctuated by higher-brow, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it self-referential humor. Between-world cutscenes in most platformers are good opportunities to get up and grab a snack. Here, they\u2019re a highlight.  When your ship full of friends (BBT makes sure to point out that this is a true \"friend ship,\" har har) crashes onto an island jail run by intelligent cat guards, your only choice is to platform through 80+ levels for their feline amusement. It sounds crazy, written out... but it works. The Behemoth fully commits to the premise and has a ton of fun with it. Balls of yarn hidden in each stage can be redeemed in a prison black market for power-ups. The narrator promises \u201csandpaper kisses\u201d for doing well.  You command your customizable prisoner with standard platforming controls \u2013 jump, double-jump, wall-jump\u2026 nothing out of the ordinary. Everything feels snappy and responsive, and I rarely felt like the controls betrayed me and caused my death, even in the hairiest segments. But BattleBlock Theater\u2019s moment-to-moment movement doesn\u2019t compare favorably to recent 2D platforming greats like Super Meat Boy. Movement is a little stiffer, the physics a little less intuitive.  The simple hand-to-hand combat system is more disappointing. You can dispatch enemies (or fellow players in multiplayer) with simple punches, kicks, and special attacks, but it lacks the precision found in the jumping. With no real attack priority, combat rapidly devolves into random button-mashing. Luckily, the bulk of the single-player campaign focuses on spot-on jumps and not enemy cat combat.  BattleBlock Theater\u2019s wildly inventive stage design is undoubtedly its greatest draw. It offers up some of the most clever, satisfying, and varied 2D platforming in years. Eight worlds are loosely sorted into gameplay themes, each stage building and tweaking ideas established in the previous one. My favorite set of stages are all designed to force two runs \u2013 once with a (relatively) easier set of challenges, and then a second time after hitting a trigger to activate lasers, disappearing blocks, roving saw blades, or some other added bit of trickiness. No idea is used twice; if an idea does repeat it\u2019s sufficiently escalated to really put your platforming skills to the test.  Stages alternate between pure Super Meat Boy-style skill and puzzle-platforming ala Braid or Toki Tori \u2013 sometimes within a few moments of each other. The variety is welcome and well-executed, and does a great job of propelling you from stage to stage. But the platforming feels better in other games, and the puzzling is lacking a hook like Braid\u2019s time mechanics \u2013 it\u2019s mostly pushing blocks.  BattleBlock Theater doubles down on its jack-of-all-trades nature in its sheer ridiculous size. This is a truly gigantic game, guaranteed to keep completionists busy for literally dozens of hours. After clearing the seven- or eight-hour campaign, you still have 24 tossed-in-just-because bonus stages (three per world) to run through. Each stage also has a gold-medal time and eight hidden collectibles, all of which are needed for the coveted A++ score. These doodads aren\u2019t afterthoughts, either, as most are hidden behind clever mini-puzzles or optional platforming sections. After all that\u2019s done, true masochists can do it all again on Insane Mode \u2013 a difficulty that removes the generously placed mid-stage checkpoints. Whew!   This would already be an incredible amount of content, but The Behemoth decided to throw in the kitchen sink while they were at it. A complete set of level-authoring tools is also included, letting anyone create and share their own custom creations. Curated playlists of the best fan-made levels are promised for months to come.  And that's just the single-player portion. BattleBlock Theater also includes a robust collection of cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes via local play or Xbox Live Arcade. Multiplayer, especially the seven competitive Arena modes, doesn\u2019t ever feel like more than an added-on curiosity, though. I enjoyed the frantic fun of knocking opponents off my turf in King of the Hill, but the iffy combat controls make it unlikely that these modes will be more than one-and-done diversions. Some of the other platforming-centered multiplayer options, such as level races, feel like they have much more potential for longer-term fun."

        "Content": "There\u2019s a limit to how much development can happen on a game in a single year, and MLB The Show 22 is the perfect example of what hitting that wall can look like. This year\u2019s entry into Sony San Diego\u2019s annualized baseball series plays as well as ever and looks great, but the confines imposed by its rigid release schedule are also more apparent than ever. A new cooperative mode is a welcome addition and an already solid stadium builder has been expanded upon nicely, but technical issues are more persistent than previous editions too. MLB The Show 22 is still a really good baseball game \u2013 it\u2019s just beginning to show signs that it may be time to call in a reliever. The lifelike recreation of Major League broadcasts in MLB The Show 22 is just as impressive as last year. There\u2019s a cinematic quality to the way player-controlled action is framed, with intros, outros, overlay graphics, and the deep pool of stats that baseball fans expect. The lovingly detailed recreations of real world ballparks look great in 4K too. The lighting is particularly stunning; real baseball games play out over multiple hours, and the in-game transition from sunset to a stadium fully illuminated against the night sky is marvelous. Suncast shadows in the afternoon give way to 360-degree illumination when the sun falls, and it\u2019s easy to forget what you see on screen is still just 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s on a hard drive. MLB The Show 22 Gameplay Screenshots 14 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There is an all new broadcast crew bringing their voices to the series this year: Jon \"Boog\" Sciambi & Chris Singleton have replaced the Matt Vasgersian-lead team as the in-game announcers. The performances are generally convincing, and new voices are refreshing after many years of the same crew. However, the number of unique lines of dialogue is noticeably lower than before, and lines repeat with greater frequency than before. There are only so many times I could hear the same bad joke about how the ball is \u201cjust not carrying to first\u201d before I wanted to mute the announcers entirely. It also leads to some baffling holes in the dialogue, like when Ken Griffey Jr., who appears with spoken lines in the Road to the Show campaign, is only referred to as \u201cNumber 24\u201d when you play with him in games. The strength of MLB The Show is traditionally in its versatility, and that\u2019s no different here. Controls can be simple, with automatic baserunning, one button pitches, and easy hitting \u2013 or they can be complex, with multi-part thumbstick movements for pitching, and precision hitting. The former is easier to execute, but the latter will yield better results if done well, incentivising and rewarding you for trying to grow your skills without gating out those who want to have a more relaxed involvement. The strength of The Show is once again in its versatility. \u201c Likewise, Franchise Mode can be played in painstaking detail, with minor league call-ups, drafting, scouting, and micromanaging of budgets, or that can all be set to auto while you focus on playing in the games themselves. You\u2019re given multiple ways to right whatever historical wrongs have kept your favorite team from winning a championship and becoming a perennial powerhouse. It\u2019s a feat of design to be able to cater to users from the casual to the hardcore, yet MLB The Show continues to set the standard for accommodating diverse tastes. That said, while Major League Baseball is nearly 150 years old, The Show is still trailing behind this ancient sports institution in a few key areas. New rules extending the Designated Hitter throughout the entire league are going into effect as of the 2022 season, yet they aren\u2019t reflected here. This is especially disappointing as it relates to two-way players, including The Show 22\u2019s cover athlete Shohei Ohtani, who is a revelation as both an elite pitcher and hitter. In real-world baseball this rule change allows him to function as both a designated hitter and starting pitcher, enabling him to be relieved as a pitcher while remaining in the game as a batter. Sadly, MLB The Show lacks the capacity to make the same allowance. It\u2019s the sort of issue one would hope can be resolved in an update, but as of release is a swing and a miss. Double Play Online co-op is one of the key new editions in 2022, allowing you to form teams for 2v2 or 3v3 competition across platforms either with friends or through random matchmaking. Players on each team alternate batters while at the plate and rotate between pitching and fielding each inning, and being able to focus single-mindedly on one defensive task is liberating. While one person plays cat and mouse with pitch selection, the other can focus on where to go for force outs and make strategic choices around the diamond. There\u2019s joyous excitement to stepping up the plate with a friend on base, knowing they are depending on you to make the hit that brings them in for a key run. However, there are some limitations to co-op too. You can play in random games or in a limited Diamond Dynasty playlist, but there are no persistent teams or co-op leagues. You can\u2019t choose your opponents either, so the only way to play against friends is luck in matchmaking. Rotating defensive roles is also mandatory, forcing you to switch back and forth even if one player only wants to pitch while the other only wants to field. I played one game with a random teammate who was a really solid hitter and defender, but their struggles on the mound doomed us as our opponents drove in multiple runs every other inning. In its current iteration, co-op feels more like a fun proof-of-concept rather than a fully fleshed-out mode fit for online competition. The stability I\u2019ve come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit. \u201c Co-op games frequently failed to connect me with cross-platform friends when we tried to play together as well, and all sorts of technical issues were unfortunately common in my time with The Show 22. Players would sometimes walk to the dugout frozen in strange poses, tutorials that I had disabled in settings would still appear, I had to restart multiple times after freezes, and online matches of any sort were prone to random disconnects. The stability I\u2019ve generally come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit, which is definitely a shame. Bases Loaded The Diamond Dynasty mode will be familiar to series veterans, allowing you to assemble teams made up of players from throughout baseball history, collected via randomized card packs, and face other player-assembled squads. The concept is well established in sports games, but the execution in The Show has been, and remains, excellent. Programs return as the battle pass stand-in: you accumulate XP by playing any of The Show\u2019s different modes, unlocking rewards as you progress up levels. Stubbs are your primary currency for purchasing packs, which you can once again buy with real money, but you also earn them at a reasonable rate regardless. I focused on completing daily challenges called \u201cMoments\u201d and was able to earn XP and Stubbs at a pace that didn't coerce me into spending cash. In no time I was able to relive the glory days of the 90\u2019s Seattle Mariners, with Ken Griffey Jr. patrolling the outfield while the golden mullet adorned Randy Johnson attacked batters with relentless fastballs. Microstransaction Reaction There are microtransactions in MLB The Show 22, just like in previous years. Paying money for Stubbs in order to unlock packs is a viable way to accelerate team building in Diamond Dynasty, but competitive teams can be built quickly through normal play as well. The cost of stubbs is fairly reasonable too: $5 will buy you 5000 stubbs, which is enough for three Show Packs that have five cards each. But even if you shell out for them, skill reigns supreme in online matches, so cash investments tend to be \u201cpay for an occasional, slight percentage advantage\u201d rather than true pay-to-win. The random nature of what can be found in card packs is also handled fairly well. You won\u2019t know what exactly you will get from a pack, but the odds of finding different kinds of cards are openly displayed, and there is enough variety of themed packs that you have a good idea what types of players you may unlock. It\u2019s still a roll of the dice, but to a more reasonable degree. A new mini-season mode is a very welcome single player focused activity for your Diamond Dynasty team, allowing you to pit them against seven CPU controlled teams in a 28-game season, complete with a miniature playoff at the end. Between this and the returning turn-based-strategy esque Conquest mode, it feels like we have reached a point where it\u2019s possible to have a rewarding Diamond Dynasty experience for players who prefer not to face the wild-west of random human opponents. On the other hand, the Road to the Show story mode is indistinguishable from previous versions, but it continues to be one of the best modes in any sports game anyway. Playing as a created prospect, following your player on their journey to the big leagues while you raise RPG-esque baseball stats, is addictive. Games often take just a few minutes, and it\u2019s hard to resist the urge to play just one more game, especially when you are seeing the ball well and making solid contact as a hitter. The few plays per game I spent on defense, framing pitches and gunning down base stealers as a catcher were great palette cleansers between at-bats, and the stat building mini games on off-days are rewarding. It still takes too long to transition from double-A to triple-A and on, but Road to the Show is so much more about the journey than the destination. Surprise! You were just called up to The Show. What position do you want to play? Pitcher Catcher Infield Outfield Designated Hitter Answer See Results The stadium builder has returned exclusively for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, unfortunately leaving The Show\u2019s Switch debut a slightly incomplete. The user interface has been tweaked, and building your dream ballpark is a smoother experience now that props can quickly be called up from a radial menu. Your custom-created stadium can now be played at day or night, and placing lights is surprisingly strategic. Prebuilt templates can expedite the process, and a great mix of serious and humorous pieces give you freedom to create both classic ballparks and absolute monstrosities. I built a ballpark with alien spaceships and a carefully illuminated (for safety) T-rex herd just because I could. It\u2019s a great example of a feature debuting one year, and improving in moderate but meaningful ways the next."

        "Content": "I've never been as consistently interrupted while playing a game at the office as I was while playing through High Moon's Transformers: War for Cybertron . I would put on headphones and play for ten or fifteen minutes, and I would suddenly feel a tingle in that weird lizard-brain proximity sense we've all got that says \"someone is in my personal space bubble.\" I'd turn around and see another IGN editor standing behind my shoulder, staring at me with pleading eyes, and I always knew what they were going to ask before they asked it: \"is it good?\" It's the look of someone afraid of getting their hopes up.  Which is why I was happy to report to those asking that Transformers: War for Cybertron is actually very good. Fantastic, even. High Moon has taken a fun, fast, third person shooter foundation, crafted a well thought out transformation mechanic on top of it, and designed combat situations around that. The end result is a shooter that has an identity all its own, and leverages its license to make something very cool for fans and newcomers alike.   More Transformers: War for Cybertron News & Previews Set millenia before the original cartoon series that fans have taken to calling G1, Transformers: War for Cybertron tells the story of the final days of the Autobot's and Decepticon's civil war on the surface of their homeworld, Cybertron. Officially sanctioned as canon by Hasbro, War for Cybertron fills in some gaps in fans' understanding of Transformers lore, explaining things like Starscream's defection from the Autobots, Optimus's succession to the position of Prime, and more. High Moon's storytelling is generally good, and feels well situated in the Transformers fiction -- it's a good modernization of the original cartoon while remaining true to the characters and stories that fans have placed on a pedestal for decades -- but there are points where the narrative jumps sloppily from one event to the next. It feels at times as though we're watching a show with episodes missing, and though there's a pre-level text crawl that does a decent job of filling in some of the details, it's still jarring cutting so quickly from triumph to despair and back again without in-game exposition.  However, while the story occasionally stumbles, High Moon's love and attention to detail with regards to G1 Transformers remains vitally palpable throughout. High Moon covers all of their bases and more in establishing their Transformers cred, as it were, even while making minor changes here and there in the interest of gameplay and plausibility. While some fans might rankle at the prospect of Soundwave transforming into a sort of Cybertronian truck, there's a point a couple of hours into the Autobot campaign that should provide ample compensation. Their redesigns of well-known Transformer archetypes like Bumblebee and Soundwave feel current and cool while remaining instantly recognizable.  With the many small details (like constantly moving pistons and gears on each Transformer in humanoid mode, as well as some great transformations), High Moon does a great job of straddling a line between fan service and respect that other games referencing revered properties often trip over. While I could have lived with a little less \"BLAM!\" from Warpath, it's hard to argue with Peter Cullen's contributions as Optimus.    Surprisingly, though, the story and treatment of the Transformers fiction isn't where War for Cybertron sees the most success. In interviews leading up to War for Cybertron's release, Executive Producer Matt Tieger stressed that the team at High Moon prioritized strong gameplay fundamentals. Rather than contriving a reason for cover based shooting in a Transformers title, High Moon has instead gone with a more immediate third-person dynamic that emphasizes up close melee combat just as much as shooting, with great results.  Transformation in War for Cybertron isn't just a gimmick; levels and encounters are designed around the ability to shift at will between vehicle and humanoid forms, and from early on, a mastery of both forms and knowing when to use them is practically a requirement. High Moon has created a shooter that rewards both strategic thinking and heavy experimentation. From double-jumping into a dash to melee a jet in mid-air, to using a detachable turret on one group of enemies then quick turning 180 degrees as a tank to take out another, to kicking into the air to transform into a jet to use flanking tactics on an enemy position, combat in Transformers: War for Cybertron is more satisfying than any third person shooter in recent memory.  While most players will most likely jump immediately into the cooperative campaign mode in Transformers: War for Cybertron, competitive multiplayer is where the game will find its legs. Marrying aspects of Unreal Championship with Tribes and the class-based finesse of games like Team Fortress 2 and Bad Company 2, War for Cybertron leverages its transformation mechanic to create something that feels shockingly new. The same combat scenarios that make the singleplayer campaign of the game so much fun are present in fast-forward online, as Scientist-class jets scream overhead and Soldiers, Scouts, and Leaders mix it up on the ground. While matches are capped at 10 players, in practice this expertly skirts an almost-too-frantic vibe from games that support far more combatants at once. Conquest mode is a particular favorite, as the momentum between the Autobot and Decepticon sides can change abruptly at the drop of a hat, making for matches that stay interesting.   Transformers: War for Cybertron at IGN.com  Is War for Cybertron perfect? No, of course not. The framerate can take a hit at a few points, and some boss battles occasionally devolve into exercises in avoiding instant or near-instant death to shoot the red flashy thing. Transformers nerds will love the character customization for each class with multiple chassis and customizable paint jobs in multiplayer while simultaneously lamenting its limitations. But these nitpicks are small in light of everything War for Cybertron does fantastically well. "

It's taken nearly 400,000 years for homosapiens to get from banging flints together to where we are now \u2013 and it may take another 400,000 years for Pro Evolution Soccer on the DS to become a decent football game at its current rate of development.  Last year's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 was a little late to the DS football party \u2013 Electronic Arts had already fielded three bona-fide FIFA titles on the console, and by the time it got to FIFA 2008 it had a very respectable football game on its hands. PES 6 was the first entry in Konami's series to hit the handheld, and it clearly wasn't yet match fit. So, one year on and some months behind its housebound brethren, what has Pro Evolution 2008 got to offer?  Naturally, PES on the DS is a quite different affair to the versions currently wooing players on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Though the established control system is present and correct - replete with trademark subtleties such as the triple-tapped low driven cross and the chipped through ball \u2013 both the visuals and the physics that bring the games together have arisen from the primordial PES soup.   Avoid the wall, little man, avoid it!  Indeed, graphically the game pales even in comparison to the series' first ever outing on the PSOne and struggles even to live up to the now pre-historic International Superstar Soccer outings on the N64. Player models are leaden and nondescript, and a strange sense of scale is present, giving them the proportions of sprightly two-year-olds gallivanting around a gargantuan pitch. Of course the DS is not blessed with the most powerful of processors, but games like Viewtiful Joe: Scratch and New Super Mario Bros. have proven that with a little flair it is possible to extract some aesthetic class out of the machine.  Likewise, the gameplay harks back to darker days of football simulations. The characteristic flow of PES games is all but absent, with a rigidity to the passage of play and a staccato rhythm to matches. With the players lost amidst the vast proportions of the pitch, it is a more viable option to sprint towards the goal, though a fixed and overly intimate camera angle means that more often than not an opposing player will suddenly appear from outside the area of vision and steal the ball. This pushes players towards using the radar \u2013 present on the bottom screen \u2013 more readily than in other more mature PES games.    In place of the Master League is the World Tour, one of the few original aspects of the DS version. Taking an original team of no-marks, the player is tasked with beating every team on the International roster. Prior to matches there are occasional mini-games, although they rarely provide anything more challenging than 'avoid the wall'. Coins are earnt for victories, which can be spent either on acquiring new talents for existing players or can be placed in the Gacha-get, a slot machine where defeated players reside waiting to be won. It's a pleasant feature, and while it definitely lacks the intricacies of wheeling and dealing in the Master League it does prove intriguing and makes for an engaging single-player experience.  There is an impressive roster of international teams that form the backbone of the World Tour \u2013 and in a charming touch you'll also learn the language and population of each nation, as well as how to say 'hello' in their native tongue \u2013 though the club team selection is more than a little threadbare. Being limited to only the licensed teams, fans of the Premier League will have to make do with playing mid-table scuff-fests, with only Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United available. Compared to FIFA's comprehensive team sheet it's more than a little lacklustre.   Do I not like that.  To the game's credit there is a wealth of multiplayer options to hand, with both single and multi-cart play, plus the ability to go online. The single cart play, as is typical of DS games, is a frustratingly limited affair, with the guest unable to make substitutions - even if one of their players is injured, forcing them to play on with 10 men - and both players having to use the same two teams over and again, but the other options promise to squeeze a little extra life out of the cart.  And all this may make depressingly familiar reading to those who indulged in Pro Evolution 6 on the DS, as to all intents and purposes this is the same game. The same game that didn't exactly impress upon its release a year ago, and certainly doesn't inspire any positive sentiment now. PES is hardly known as the most forward thinking of series, with the gap between each iteration seemingly getting smaller and smaller year on year, but the baby steps taken by the new DS version really are so miniscule as to be almost undetectable.

        "Content": "The ninth generation of Pokemon has been a roller coaster ride, to say the least. With the introduction of a fully open world and non-linear objectives, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet finally made the freedom of the monster-filled adventures I dreamed of as a child a playable reality. But that reality was a technical disaster, turning what should have been a standing ovation for the series into a smattering of lukewarm golf claps. Multiple post-launch updates and its first DLC did nothing to fix this, and The Teal Mask expansion specifically was all around a disappointment of its own. So here we are: The Indigo Disk. The last DLC, and presumably the final significant word ( epilogue aside ) on Pokemon's ambitious and chaotic ninth generation. Is it an improvement? Yes, but not entirely. While The Indigo Disk's new area, battles, quests, and challenges are an excellent coda to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in almost every way, it's all still being bogged down by the numerous problems that have become synonymous with Pokemon's first true foray into the open world. The Indigo Disk takes place at Blueberry Academy, a human-made island off the coast of Pokemon Black and White's Unova region where your character becomes an exchange student. It continues the story of siblings Kieran and Carmine that started in The Teal Mask DLC earlier this year, with The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk serving as two halves of a whole story: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero. I won't spoil more, but I came away with mixed feelings on The Indigo Disk's campaign, especially in light of how excellent Scarlet and Violet's base story was. Returning antihero Kieran's plot especially felt awkward and contrived, and the whole story being split between the two DLC halves and two disparate locations with almost entirely separate casts of supporting characters didn't help. It was strange too that the titular \"Hidden Treasure of Area Zero\" was tacked onto the end of Indigo Disk's campaign, like someone realized last minute what the title was and scrambled to make it work.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask But despite being wrapped in a flimsy story, The Indigo Disk is a pretty darn fun DLC. Its campaign is at its best when it once again turns you loose upon the open world, letting you defeat a series of interesting and diverse opponents in any order you please. This is the freedom that I loved in Scarlet and Violet, and which was mysteriously missing in The Teal Mask. What's more, The Indigo Disk is challenging in a good way - most of the battles in the DLC are double battles, and your opponents' teams are strategically composed, often packing competitive trappings like held items, complimentary movesets, and interesting Tera types. There's even one required set of battles that forces you to train up a new team of Pokemon specifically caught in the DLC. Seasoned Pokemon players with competitive or raid-ready teams likely still won't have a problem in The Indigo Disk, but if you're trying to roll through with a haphazard collection of fellas that got you through the main story, you might need to rethink your plans. The Indigo Disk is challenging in a good way \u201c Most of my time in The Indigo Disk was spent in the Terarium (yes, it\u2019s spelled that way), a massive, self-contained Safari Zone of sorts divided into four different biomes all stuffed with new (to Scarlet and Violet) Pokemon. After being fairly lukewarm on Scarlet and Violet's world design, I actually thought the Terarium was a marked improvement: it has more diverse landmarks condensed into a smaller space, which makes it a lot more interesting to explore. Instead of finding the same Pokemon all over each zone, many of them are localized to very specific areas: there's one beach where Galarian Slowpoke all hang out and take naps, for instance, and a Pride Rock-themed outcropping appropriately covered in Litleo. There's a cool underground labyrinth where Mudkips hide, and a deep cave full of lightning-charged stones and electric spiders if you dive far enough. I loved stumbling across all these little pockets of Pokemon, and I'm still finding surprising new corners of the Terarium as I work to complete my Blueberry Pokedex.

These are short, simple tasks that you can complete in the Terarium, such as \"Catch a Pokemon\" or \"Photograph a Pokemon in the Polar Biome.\" In return you\u2019ll get Blueberry Points, or BP, which can then be spent on all kinds of prizes. Some of these are cosmetic, such as the ability to change up how your character throws a PokeBall, or to decorate a club room in Blueberry Academy. But the most interesting (and expensive) options unlock even more new Pokemon for the Terarium, or let you invite powerful trainers such as Scarlet and Violet's Gym Leaders and Elite Four to Blueberry Academy for rematches and, delightfully, new story conversations for fan favorite characters like Rika and Larry. There are tons of interesting things to spend BP on, including a bonus final boss battle - enough to keep me busy for quite a while to come.

You\u2019ve always been able to adventure through Paldea with up to four players simultaneously, but there wasn't really any advantage to doing this outside of cooperative sandwich making. But in the Terarium, all players can contribute to and receive BP from one another's BBQs, and even unlock special group quests for bigger payouts.

The framerate is an inconsistent mess, lighting effects toggle on and off seemingly at random, models pop in and out at short distances and sometimes very rapidly like weirdo ghosts, characters who aren\u2019t even that far away walk like a bad stop-motion animated cartoon, everything slows to a crawl when there\u2019s more than one environmental effect (like rain or ocean waves) on screen at a time...There are also tons of bizarre clipping issues where Pok\u00e9mon can get caught in walls or underground, or the camera gets stuck at an odd angle and shows an empty void on half the screen. Score: 6 Read the full review right here. And if that\u2019s not enough, here\u2019s another still-relevant paragraph about the problems with raiding from my review of The Teal Mask DLC earlier this year: What I Said About Raiding in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in The Teal Mask DLC I don\u2019t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid battles from the original review still haven\u2019t been fixed, which tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet refreshes its available raids and doesn\u2019t notify you when they\u2019re full. And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn, freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what\u2019s going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without running into this stuff and being frustrated by it. Score: 5 Read the full review right here. Literally all of that is still true in The Indigo Disk, somehow. There's a big chunk of the Savannah biome in the Terarium with mud puddles that inexplicably causes heinous stuttering whenever you get too close. Multiple times, my game froze for several whole seconds and made me think it was about to crash. Another problem lies in the newly-added ability to fly freely around anywhere you want, which does an exemplary job of showing off how haphazardly taped together everything is as entire landmarks flash wildly in and out of existence. And as before, co-op mode or online play makes everything run about 10% worse. I have tried time and time again to ignore all these issues while playing and just enjoy Pokemon. But every single time, some stupid, obvious bug yanks me out of it, like my Tinkaton completely wrecking in-battle camera angles, or the brightness randomly turning all the way up while I'm just trying to make a sandwich. It's inexcusable."

For me Halo has always been a social experience, with lifelong friendships forged over a shared love of the game. Some hop online to randomly test their merit in competitive matches. Others find themselves lost in the fiction, playing through the campaign alone and then poring over the extended story in books and anime. Still others look to Halo for a creative outlet as level forgers or machinima producers. This range in how we play Halo is a testament to how feature-rich development studio Bungie has made the franchise, and Halo: Reach is the ultimate punctuation on a decade's work.  This is the end of the Halo road for Bungie -- the group is set to move on to a new original game next while Microsoft takes over responsibility for the franchise's future -- and that sense of this being a finale is in Halo: Reach. It shows clear reference to past games, refines well-established game mechanics, adds a few exciting twists, and polishes the rest to a glossy finish. The result is one of the most complete, fully-featured packages you'll find in gaming.   Little here will surprise the hardcore Halo fan, especially if they were among the millions that took part in the multiplayer beta earlier this year. The approach to making a first-person shooter remains the same as it has in the past for Halo. There's a co-op friendly campaign filled with the dreaded Covenant aliens, sparkling online competitive multiplayer, the four-player Firefight mode, and lots of flexibility to allow everyone to tweak settings to their liking. If you've played a Halo game in the past, you'll feel instantly at home.  That's not to say this is just another rehash. There's plenty of new and exciting content in Halo: Reach and it begins with the main character. Master Chief is out. This time you'll step into the shoes of Noble 6, a nameless hero for players to project themselves onto. Noble 6 doesn't even have a defined gender. Thanks to a deep new customization system, you're free to fit Noble 6's look to your personality.  A dark tale of destruction awaits you.  Noble 6's tale begins with an introduction to Planet Reach. This colony is the center of humanity's military might, and home to the Spartan program that produced Master Chief himself. The events of Halo: Reach take place as a prequel to the main Halo trilogy and -- though they take small liberties with the established fiction -- help to tell the story of the events that lead up to events of Halos 1 through 3. The war with the Covenant is already raging, and things don't look good for us humans.  Noble 6 is the rookie member of Noble Team, a squad of Spartans stationed on Reach. You'll get to know each of the other team members through the course of Halo: Reach as you work with them to complete various missions, but the action always follows Noble 6's adventure.  The whole shebang will last you about nine or ten hours on your first play through on the Heroic difficulty (less if you're real good and more if you aren't). During that time you'll find a lot of tried and true mainstays of the Halo formula. That means plenty of big battlefields, crazy vehicles, lots of aliens to fight, and tons of weapons to help make the Covenant pay. Though past Halo games were filled with repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots, Halo: Reach does not suffer from these problems.   This is the most straightforward and enjoyable tale of destruction the franchise has yet to produce. And don't worry if you haven't played the other Halo games yet \u2013 though Reach will feel a lot deeper and more compelling to longtime Halo fans, it can stand on its own as a self-contained story. The tale starts out simple enough, but it quickly escalates to stunning set pieces before pulling out all the stops. The last third of the game is just one big thrill ride, and the revelations that occur during that part of the game are sure to make any Halo buff go ballistic. The ending in particular left a huge impression on me. I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that the space combat Bungie used to tease Halo: Reach is only the beginning.  Now, though the Halo formula is intact and there are plenty of wink-and-a-nod references to past games, Reach is a big step forward.

The action is always moving through one combat scenario to the next, with plenty of gameplay and scenario twists to keep things fresh.  Halo Personality Quiz -- Find out which Spartan you are.  The best new addition? Armor abilities. These are an evolution of the equipment found in Halo 3 and drastically change the way you play in their updated form. These temporary but reusable extra abilities add things like sprinting, jet packs, and invincible armor to the franchise for the first time. The result is a faster, more acrobatic game that affords the player more flexibility in how they'd like to approach each fight. Also, jet packs are awesome. How did we go without them this long?  These new features and refined, classic design work in concert well enough that Halo: Reach often meets that gaming ideal of pure immersion -- the core components that can remind you that you're playing a game are a nonentity while you focus on the action at hand. While playing I found myself slipping into that state quite often, only occasionally ripped out by nasty difficulty spikes. Halo: Reach is a tough game on the harder settings -- easily the most difficult in the franchise -- and it only gets more challenging as you add co-op players thanks to a scaling difficulty.   That sense of immersion is helped along quite a bit by the amazing audio work and the new graphics engine built for Halo: Reach. Marty O'Donnell, the lead sound guy at Bungie, has once again delivered an epic soundtrack that is so good that it elevates the entire game. That's no small feat.  While that music pummels your ear drums, your eyes get to feast on one gorgeous looking game. The alien vistas and color palette are striking, and the sense of scale is oftentimes off the charts. You're fighting amidst a war that rages across an entire planet, and Bungie doesn't let you forget it. Even so, there are times when the epic battles don't quite feel so incredible thanks to a lack of detail or the occasional framerate stutter while the engine can't keep up with what's happening.  It's difficult to separate out the core components of Halo: Reach because they all sort of blend together into one massive experience. The campaign can be played alone or with up to four-players on a split-screen or online. Likewise, you can play the Firefight mode, a single map test of skill and endurance against waves of Covenant enemies, with a few friends cooperatively. All of those great additions that made it into the campaign? Well they're here too. This mode was introduced in Halo 3: ODST, but has finally met its promise thanks to online matchmaking and a more robust set of options. One of which is a competitive versus mode where you can compete for points while one or more players take up the side of the Covenant.

Like Firefight, the core concept remains the same as past Halo games while new features, weapons and modes have been added. Armor abilities and tweaked physics make the game that millions have poured hours and hours into feel fresh once again. It doesn't hurt that the new modes like Headhunter and Invasion are a ton of fun. The format is warmly familiar, but it all feels so new after digging into the competitive game and learning new tricks and skills.  Wrapped around all of this is an addition that Bungie calls player investment. Everything you do -- be it play the campaign or complete an online match -- earns you credits. Rack up enough and you can unlock customization features to make your Noble 6 look elite, and that look carries through all modes in the game -- even cut scenes. Don't be surprised if you find a goofy, pink-and-blue Noble 6 invading your game like IGN editor-in-chief Hilary Goldstein did. If you make your character look dumb, it's your own fault.  Firefight has met its promise.

This, for me, is the kicker. I don't think I'm going to be able to stop logging on every few days for a new challenge, followed by a little message to a friend taunting them about how I did it faster.  The one aspect of Halo: Reach I found lacking was in the multiplayer map selection. There are 13 total for competitive games, but four of those are either direct copies or retreads of maps from past Halo games. Everything plays quite differently with all of the gameplay tweaks, but I can already see myself looking forward to the first map pack. It's tough to complain about a lack of content in such a feature rich game, but I was left hoping for more.  IGN's History of Halo  That issue is mitigated to some extent by the incredible amount of flexibility built into Halo: Reach. The Forge, where players can lightly edit the competitive maps, is back and now much more user friendly. Most won't take advantage of that tool, but they will benefit from the new map and game variants that the hardcore create and share with the community.  It's also incredibly simple to just hop in and edit the rules of the game, both for Firefight and in normal multiplayer games. You can tweak everything from which enemies you face in Firefight to how much damage weapons do, and a whole lot more. Think of a crazy game variant -- even one that doesn't have anything to do with shooting -- and you can probably make it and share it with your friends in Halo: Reach. The whole system is incredibly powerful and equally impressive. The only downer is that there is no way to search for a custom game. If a game type isn't in the predetermined matchmaking hoppers and you don't have friends online, you're out of luck.  Yeah, you can play as the Elites online.  All told, the multiplayer suite is one of the best ever. The Halo multiplayer game has been expanding since the early days of the original Xbox, and now it's hit a point where the amount of , flexibility, number of modes, and potential for fun is just out of this world.

This, however, is actually a pretty cool set of goodies, all for just an extra $10. Inside the larger box, you'll find a black DVD case that will make Halo: Reach stand out in your collection. That's a nice touch, but it's only the start. You'll also find an \"artifact bag\" that contains notes from Dr. Halsey, the creator of the Spartan program and blueprint  for Cortana. This bag is a must for any real Halo fan. Inside a hardbound notebook, you'll get tons of inside info made to look like it was handwritten by the good doctor, a patch, a mock UNSC security badge, a color map and a whole lot more. Play Halo: Reach and then go back and read through the manual for a deeper understanding of what happened in the game. Last, but not least, you can find a code to get a special armor set for your Elite multiplayer model. The Halo: Reach Limited Edition package is a great one, and one that I would recommend to anybody that wants more than the base game but can't quite afford the very expensive Legendary Edition.

        "Content": "There have been a touch over 100 Formula One Grands Prix since the sport\u2019s controversial engine revision in 2014. Over half of them have been clinched by a single bloke, and more than 80 of them won by the same manufacturer. Terms like \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018predictable\u2019 aren\u2019t exactly the types of adjectives F1 bosses would want associated with the world\u2019s top-tier motorsport, but they\u2019re being levelled at F1 with increasing gusto from all corners. However, while real-life F1 may be flagging somewhat after more than half-a-decade of spirit-sucking Mercedes dominance, Codemasters\u2019 F1 games have only become stronger with each instalment. The crew at Codemasters have whipped the studio\u2019s F1 franchise into one of the best racing series on four wheels, and F1 2019 continues that winning run. The improvements over F1 2018 are only moderate, but F1 2019 is not only the best F1 game to date, it\u2019s one that\u2019s frequently more thrilling, more interesting, and more rewarding than watching the real thing. This year\u2019s biggest bullet point is the addition of the Formula 2 World Championship, which exists in F1 2019 as both a standalone championship to complete a full season within, and also as a heavily-truncated appetiser to kick-off F1 2019\u2019s returning 10-season career mode. Tackled separately, all the unique elements that distinguish F2 from F1 seem to have been captured here, from its two-races-per-round format to its spectator-friendly reverse grids. It even comes with its own bespoke commentary duo. It\u2019s no surprise the studio has been able to squeeze in the Dallara F2 chassis and have it feel equally distinct \u201c Codemasters has been adding retro F1 cars to the F1 series for some time now, all with their own handling nuances that set them apart from today\u2019s bleeding-edge F1 cars, so it\u2019s no surprise the studio has been able to squeeze in the Dallara F2 chassis and have it feel equally distinct. They\u2019re not as fast as F1 cars but they have less downforce, so they\u2019re actually slightly trickier to drive in certain situations. Unlike F1, F2 is a spec series so all the cars are identical in terms of performance. If you want to hop straight into the regular career mode, however, F1 2019 condenses a season of F2 down into a brief string of three late-race scenarios plucked from what\u2019s destined to be your racer\u2019s final year in the feeder series before snaring a contact in the big leagues. Here Codemasters introduces a pair of fantasy drivers \u2013 the shrewd but sportsmanlike German Lukas Weber and the cocksure Devon Butler, an arrogant Brit who appears to be using his racing career as an audition to appear as the next Die Hard villain. You\u2019ll move to F1 regardless of how you perform in these set-ups but, depending on your decisions and finishing positions, your first-person cutscenes with Weber and Butler will change. It\u2019s the closest Codemasters has flirted to an engaging story mode within a racer since the Race Driver days, but don\u2019t get used to it; unfortunately, it all dries up following your driver\u2019s promotion to F1. Weber and Butler will make the leap alongside you (at the expense of the number two drivers for the teams they join) but the animated interactions cease and are replaced with the occasional text interview emailed through to your inbox by your agent. Weber has praised my F1 debut and Butler has continued to be a dick but, without the face-to-face interactions in the garage or paddock, the rivalry between these former F2 drivers just fades into the background and it's business as usual. Garages are full of tools, but here is the biggest one. The F2 content can be completely bypassed if you prefer (and doing so will prevent Weber and Butler from usurping real F1 drivers during your first season) but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d recommend. One, the F2 prologue is top fun and two, without it, little else has changed to set F1 2019\u2019s career mode drastically apart from last year\u2019s version. The Song Remains the Same The same contract and perk system has returned from F1 2018, as has the spectre of incoming regulation changes that threaten to derail months and months of R&D gains on your car. The R&D tree system itself is the same, too, and like F1 2018 you can still gather enough points to launch regular part development even if you skip the practice sessions (which, after four years of running on the same tracks, can definitely be a bit of a slog). Morale in each of the R&D departments can still be impacted during post-session interviews, which are identical to F1 2018 \u2013 same effervescent Scottish reporter, same surly camera chap, same questions. There still doesn\u2019t seem to be any point in selecting destructive answers that\u2019ll only serve to put your R&D crew(s) offside and slow down car improvements, but I still like the concept; it just hasn\u2019t really gone anywhere since F1 2018. Invitational events in retro cars are still sprinkled between F1 championship rounds but we\u2019ve played this sort of gear before. It\u2019s crisp and gorgeous (and there\u2019s a new garage section to ogle cars from any angle) but F1 2018 was already no slouch in the beauty stakes. The fonts and HUD have had a slight spruce up but the video interstitials between the on-track action haven\u2019t changed; experienced players will have seen these fist pumps and victory animations a thousand times. Well, thanks anyway. If I seem like I\u2019ve begun to repeat myself from previous years, it\u2019s because F1 2019 is doing the same thing. Admittedly, there\u2019s probably only finite wiggle room for reinvention when you\u2019re already an authentic, class-leading simulation of a real-life sport but, if things like R&D and practice programs are going to remain set in stone, perhaps added flavour can come from elsewhere? F1 2019 does add long-awaited driver changes so, just like in real-life, AI-controlled F1 stars are now free to take on new contracts with rival teams (mid-season shuffles add a bit of drama to proceedings and drivers finally being able to change teams definitely keeps the grid a lot fresher as you own career progresses through the years). Yet I can\u2019t help but wonder about how much more personality F1 2019 would\u2019ve had if the loose thread Codemasters plucked at during the F2 prologue had been tugged on a little longer. Apex Legends On track, F1 2019 feels just as spectacular as we\u2019ve become accustomed to and, as usual, Codemasters has successfully crafted a game that can be either a satisfyingly taxing simulation or an easy-to-grasp, arcade-esque experience smoothed out by an array of potent driving aids. The AI is absolutely the best I\u2019ve seen in the series\u2019 10-year stint at Codemasters; it\u2019s assertive and racey, it exploits gaps, and it protects itself effectively. F1 drivers are amongst the best on the planet and F1 2019\u2019s terrific AI does a bang-up job of making them seem that way. The AI is so good I personally don\u2019t know why one would subject themselves to racing against other players online; I certainly have barrels more fun going head-to-head with the authentically precise AI opponents than I do subjecting myself to ranked or unranked races against random players that usually unfold with all the civility of a bar brawl. I don\u2019t really have the patience to be punted off track in collisions that F1 2019\u2019s incident tracking system fails to even register. To be fair, however, plenty of pistonheads live for this sort of malarkey and F1 2019 features the series\u2019 biggest and boldest multiplayer component yet. Bucketing rain certainly never makes online less chaotic. There\u2019s now a multiplayer spec car designed to 2019 regulations that can be customised with a variety of liveries. It\u2019s not a fully-fledged livery editor like Gran Turismo Sport or the Forza franchise (sponsors are locked and the designs are limited to premade templates) but colour schemes can be changed. Leagues can now be formed from a dedicated hub within the game, allowing keen online racers to more easily seek out like-minded players to regularly play with (whether that\u2019s just you and a few friends playing out a championship against the AI, or a full field of fellow humans scrapping for the podium). Codemasters has also integrated scheduled weekly GPs that you can complete practice and qualifying sessions for leading up to the weekend race, which begins at pre-set times. There\u2019s a lot of multiplayer to chew on here \u2013 even F1\u2019s strong, official esports culture is baked right into the front end now \u2013 so feel free to ignore my general disdain for racing online. There\u2019s generally several thousand kilometres of ocean between me and my nearest competitor (and they have faster internet in Kosovo than we do in Australia)."

        "Title": "Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball Review",
        "Subtitle": "There still is not a good dodgeball game on XBLA.",
        "Content": "Pirates are cool. Ninja are cool. Dodgeball is at least cool enough to get featured on ESPN 8 (The Ocho) in comedic films. And yet, this game is boring. It just goes to show you: No matter how many fun things you toss into a game, it won't be engaging without a solid foundation. Pirates vs. Ninjas attempts to bring some flare to the classic schoolyard game without much success. The final product is something that isn't quite the standard dodgeball, but isn't quite fun either.  Pirates vs. Ninjas pits teams of two, three or four against one another with the goal of pegging your opponent with the ball. That's where the similarities to classic dodgeball end. Instead of being hit once and heading to the sidelines, players are given health bars. If you want to get the upper hand, you can physically attack a foe to stun them (only a dodgeball can do real damage) or use your individual character's special move to do anything from stunning groups of opponents to making yourself temporarily invisible. Add in power and homing throws, catches, dodges and reversals and you've got your basic move set. The traditional dodgeball mechanics (one hit and you're out, catching the ball brings a player back, etc.) are thrown out in favor of a game that actually feels more like a arena brawler where you attack with a ball than a proper dodgeball game.   This hardly feels like dodgeball. The trouble starts to hit home in the way this new version of dodgeball is delivered. The camera angle never gives you a good view of the field. This is, at times, a nuisance, and it always makes you feel removed from the action whenever you run to the back half or corners to retrieve a ball. The arena designs (all four of them) are bland. When you do a power throw, the game adds a slowdown effect. Play a four on four match with the maximum five dodgeballs in play and you'll wind up with a game that moves in fits, constantly slowing the action down in a way that is just plain annoying.  The visuals, which could be considered decent for an XBLA game, are given a blur treatment that feels off-putting. These factors all add together to make the game a drag to play.  There are three different game types in Pirates vs. Ninja that mostly differ in where you're allowed to run. One lets you go anywhere in the arena while another only gives you three seconds on the opponent's side before forcing you to turn and scamper back. Then there's \"traditional\" dodgeball that takes away special moves and only allows you to cross the center line by jumping. You still have a health bar, though. While playing, I kept feeling a nagging desire to play some good old-fashioned dodgeball where one hit puts you on the sideline and catching the ball is the greatest risk/reward move you can pull off. But I guess that's not extreme enough for this cast of characters.   Pirates wouldn't stand for this. In addition to the titular pirate and ninja squads, you can play as robots or zombies. You can take each through a story mode to learn a bit more about the cast of characters through text boxes in between matches. As it turns out, the different factions don't like each other and play dodgeball to take that anger out on each other. That's about all there is to it aside from some humor that mostly falls flat.  The main reason to play Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball , if you're so inclined, is for the multiplayer game. You can play a local game with up to four players, co-operatively or on teams verse each other. You can also hop online and play with up to seven others for a four-on-four matchup. I didn't find any of these options appealing and had trouble convincing other editors here at IGN to play more than one match with me for this review.",

        "id": "183f73e6d8c442208f6dc0bf9c3bd984",
        "Content": "The idiom about \"honor among thieves\" is put to the test in Monaco: What's Yours is Mine, a charming and challenging indie heist game on PC and XBLA. It completely succeeds in marrying the twists and turns of classic crime movies with the addictive nature of arcade staples like Pac-Man. When played alone, it stands proudly as a rewarding stealth game with a surprisingly engaging story. But when played with three friends, Monaco becomes one of the most chaotically entertaining multiplayer experiences of the past year.  Throughout 30 chapters, you'll fleece banks, escape burning yachts, and bust fellow thieves out of prison. The wide variety of objectives is key in conveying the surprisingly intricate story. Fans of The Third Man, Reservoir Dogs, and The Usual Suspects will find a lot of great homages and storytelling devices. Over the course of the campaign I actually grew to care about each of the eight bandits, thanks not only to their distinct abilities, but also to small touches like unique idling animations and dialogue cadences. Their inherent talents make replaying levels a joy, and experimenting with each one is key to passing some of the late-game missions. For example, the Hacker can quickly disable security systems, the Mole can dig through walls, and the Redhead can seduce hostile guards. This all culminates with a wonderfully satisfying suite of missions that defy expectations and deliver immense payoffs.  When playing by yourself, Monaco is a methodical series of well-designed challenges. I gladly devoted quite a few nights to mastering levels in order to see my name positioned at the top of the leaderboards. But Monaco shines brightest when a party of four saddles up to a single television or monitor. Despite having a shared goal and promoting teamwork, a natural spirit of competition arose during each level \u2013 I wanted to be the star of the team. I wanted to be the one to gather the most coins, grab the targeted loot, and ultimately make it to the exit first. In a time when local multiplayer has become rare, Monaco stands out as a testament that competitive and cooperative fun can be had playing in the same room. (Online co-op is also supported.)  Though it's minimalistic, this stylish, pixelated depiction of the French Riviera succeeds on nearly all fronts, matching the vibrant energy of their real-world analogues. The din of lavish casinos and sprawling majesty of royal palaces come across exceedingly well. Where the art style occasionally backfires is when the lack of detail in the environment becomes confusing \u2013 too often, I found myself being chased down a hallway only to discover that the what I thought was a door was actually a light socket. You can't escape through one of those.  The most interesting mechanic in Monaco is in its treatment of line of sight. Unlike a lot of top-down games, here you never know what might be on the other side of a closed door until you open it. Likewise, you can use this to your advantage by sticking behind cover and evading your pursuers. It takes a bit to get used to, but once I grew accustomed to its unique take on vision, I found myself wondering why so few top-down games implement a similar system.  Of course, it wouldn't work at all if Monaco were the type of stealth game that you automatically fail every time you're spotted. In fact, it's at its frantic best when your team of up to four completely botches a mission and becomes less like Ocean's Eleven and more like Benny Hill. The chaotic scramble to evade guards, disarm lasers, and find your mark unravels with impeccable charm.  Monaco only fumbles a bit in the balancing of certain wildly overpowered enemies who threaten to tip the challenge towards unfair. Being torn to pieces by a shotgun fired from across a parking lot doesn't feel all that satisfying. Luckily there aren't many of those guys, and they don't amount to more than a minor annoyance. But in a game this good, it's something that's certainly noticeable. The entire package is enhanced by a fantastic score from Austin Wintory, the Grammy-nominated composer of Journey. A distant departure from his music in IGN's 2012 Game of the Year, the composition for Monaco is an energetic throwback to jazz throughout the '50s and '60s. The dynamic music ebbs and flows depending on the state of your heist. Remaining stealthy means a simple piano riff, while completely running amok brings in a slew of chaotic instrumental accompaniments. It felt like I was listening to my own personal theme music."

        "Title": "Halo: Reach Legendary Edition Review",
        "Subtitle": "Legendary indeed. ",

        "id": "1e0871a43481fd9b6aa0b95f7035eec0",
        "Content": "Halo means so much to so many people. This is not extraordinary in the culture of videogames. What's exceptional is how many different things it means to those players. For me Halo has always been a social experience, with lifelong friendships forged over a shared love of the game. Some hop online to randomly test their merit in competitive matches. Others find themselves lost in the fiction, playing through the campaign alone and then poring over the extended story in books and anime. Still others look to Halo for a creative outlet as level forgers or machinima producers. This range in how we play Halo is a testament to how feature-rich development studio Bungie has made the franchise, and Halo: Reach is the ultimate punctuation on a decade's work. This is the end of the Halo road for Bungie -- the group is set to move on to a new original game next while Microsoft takes over responsibility for the franchise's future -- and that sense of this being a finale is in Halo: Reach. It shows clear reference to past games, refines well-established game mechanics, adds a few exciting twists, and polishes the rest to a glossy finish. The result is one of the most complete, fully-featured packages you'll find in gaming. Legendary Edition The Legendary Edition contains everything the less expensive Limited Edition comes with, plus a lot more to justify the $150 price tag. It's all housed inside a special case made to look like an ONI security container. This is a pretty substantial set of bonus content, so let's get right to it. Like the Limited Edition, the Legendary box has a special black DVD case to house your copy of Halo: Reach. It's a nice touch, though not as sweet as the Halo 2 metal case I still proudly display on my shelf. The other crossover content with the Limited Edition includes an \"artifact bag\" that contains notes from Dr. Halsey, the creator of the Spartan program and blueprint  for Cortana. This bag is a must for any real Halo fan. Inside a hardbound notebook, you'll get tons of inside info made to look like it was handwritten by the good doctor, a patch, a mock UNSC security badge, a color map and a whole lot more. Play Halo: Reach and then go back and read through the manual for a deeper understanding of what happened in the game. Inside the disc case, you can find a code to download several exclusive pieces of content. There's a special flaming helmet armor affect for your Spartan (previously only available to Bungie employees), a cool Elite costume, and a Falcon Avatar accessory. This code also gives you two free days of Xbox Live Gold and a behind the scenes video delivered in a unique way. Rather than putting the video on a disc, it can be watched through Halo Waypoint after redeeming the code. Make sure you play the game before watching the behind the scenes video. It's two hours long and filled with spoilers, according to the descriptor. It wasn't available for us to watch in Halo: Waypoint pre-launch, so we can't comment on its quality. The crown jewel in the Legendary Edition is the hand crafted statue of Noble Team. This limited statue will surely make your friends jealous -- it's made for the true fan and collector. It's sturdy, well-crafted, and exactly the sort of thing that will make the Halo fanboys cry tears of joy. Little here will surprise the hardcore Halo fan, especially if they were among the millions that took part in the multiplayer beta earlier this year. The approach to making a first-person shooter remains the same as it has in the past for Halo. There's a co-op friendly campaign filled with the dreaded Covenant aliens, sparkling online competitive multiplayer, the four-player Firefight mode, and lots of flexibility to allow everyone to tweak settings to their liking. If you've played a Halo game in the past, you'll feel instantly at home. That's not to say this is just another rehash. There's plenty of new and exciting content in Halo: Reach and it begins with the main character. Master Chief is out. This time you'll step into the shoes of Noble 6, a nameless hero for players to project themselves onto. Noble 6 doesn't even have a defined gender. Thanks to a deep new customization system, you're free to fit Noble 6's look to your personality. Noble 6's tale begins with an introduction to Planet Reach. This colony is the center of humanity's military might, and home to the Spartan program that produced Master Chief himself. The events of Halo: Reach take place as a prequel to the main Halo trilogy and -- though they take small liberties with the established fiction -- help to tell the story of the events that lead up to events of Halos 1 through 3. The war with the Covenant is already raging, and things don't look good for us humans. Noble 6 is the rookie member of Noble Team, a squad of Spartans stationed on Reach. You'll get to know each of the other team members through the course of Halo: Reach as you work with them to complete various missions, but the action always follows Noble 6's adventure. The whole shebang will last you about nine or ten hours on your first play through on the Heroic difficulty (less if you're real good and more if you aren't). During that time you'll find a lot of tried and true mainstays of the Halo formula. That means plenty of big battlefields, crazy vehicles, lots of aliens to fight, and tons of weapons to help make the Covenant pay. Though past Halo games were filled with repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots, Halo: Reach does not suffer from these problems. This is the most straightforward and enjoyable tale of destruction the franchise has yet to produce. And don't worry if you haven't played the other Halo games yet \u2013 though Reach will feel a lot deeper and more compelling to longtime Halo fans, it can stand on its own as a self-contained story. The tale starts out simple enough, but it quickly escalates to stunning set pieces before pulling out all the stops. The last third of the game is just one big thrill ride, and the revelations that occur during that part of the game are sure to make any Halo buff go ballistic. The ending in particular left a huge impression on me. I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that the space combat Bungie used to tease Halo: Reach is only the beginning. Now, though the Halo formula is intact and there are plenty of wink-and-a-nod references to past games, Reach is a big step forward. Little successful elements of old Halo games are sprinkled here or there while a newfound sensibility in level design and pacing is wrapped around the core. The action is always moving through one combat scenario to the next, with plenty of gameplay and scenario twists to keep things fresh. The best new addition? Armor abilities. These are an evolution of the equipment found in Halo 3 and drastically change the way you play in their updated form. These temporary but reusable extra abilities add things like sprinting, jet packs, and invincible armor to the franchise for the first time. The result is a faster, more acrobatic game that affords the player more flexibility in how they'd like to approach each fight. Also, jet packs are awesome. How did we go without them this long? These new features and refined, classic design work in concert well enough that Halo: Reach often meets that gaming ideal of pure immersion -- the core components that can remind you that you're playing a game are a nonentity while you focus on the action at hand. While playing I found myself slipping into that state quite often, only occasionally ripped out by nasty difficulty spikes. Halo: Reach is a tough game on the harder settings -- easily the most difficult in the franchise -- and it only gets more challenging as you add co-op players thanks to a scaling difficulty. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images That sense of immersion is helped along quite a bit by the amazing audio work and the new graphics engine built for Halo: Reach. Marty O'Donnell, the lead sound guy at Bungie, has once again delivered an epic soundtrack that is so good that it elevates the entire game. That's no small feat. While that music pummels your ear drums, your eyes get to feast on one gorgeous looking game. The alien vistas and color palette are striking, and the sense of scale is oftentimes off the charts. You're fighting amidst a war that rages across an entire planet, and Bungie doesn't let you forget it. Even so, there are times when the epic battles don't quite feel so incredible thanks to a lack of detail or the occasional framerate stutter while the engine can't keep up with what's happening. It's difficult to separate out the core components of Halo: Reach because they all sort of blend together into one massive experience. The campaign can be played alone or with up to four-players on a split-screen or online. Likewise, you can play the Firefight mode, a single map test of skill and endurance against waves of Covenant enemies, with a few friends cooperatively. All of those great additions that made it into the campaign? Well they're here too. This mode was introduced in Halo 3: ODST, but has finally met its promise thanks to online matchmaking and a more robust set of options. One of which is a competitive versus mode where you can compete for points while one or more players take up the side of the Covenant. Or you can just go all out in a fight against other players by joining the competitive online multiplayer game. Like Firefight, the core concept remains the same as past Halo games while new features, weapons and modes have been added. Armor abilities and tweaked physics make the game that millions have poured hours and hours into feel fresh once again. It doesn't hurt that the new modes like Headhunter and Invasion are a ton of fun. The format is warmly familiar, but it all feels so new after digging into the competitive game and learning new tricks and skills. Wrapped around all of this is an addition that Bungie calls player investment. Everything you do -- be it play the campaign or complete an online match -- earns you credits. Rack up enough and you can unlock customization features to make your Noble 6 look elite, and that look carries through all modes in the game -- even cut scenes. Don't be surprised if you find a goofy, pink-and-blue Noble 6 invading your game like IGN editor-in-chief Hilary Goldstein did. If you make your character look dumb, it's your own fault. Likewise, Xbox Live members can take part in daily or weekly challenges created by Bungie with an eye towards compelling players to come back again and again to prove their skills. This, for me, is the kicker. I don't think I'm going to be able to stop logging on every few days for a new challenge, followed by a little message to a friend taunting them about how I did it faster. The one aspect of Halo: Reach I found lacking was in the multiplayer map selection. There are 13 total for competitive games, but four of those are either direct copies or retreads of maps from past Halo games. Everything plays quite differently with all of the gameplay tweaks, but I can already see myself looking forward to the first map pack. It's tough to complain about a lack of content in such a feature rich game, but I was left hoping for more. That issue is mitigated to some extent by the incredible amount of flexibility built into Halo: Reach. The Forge, where players can lightly edit the competitive maps, is back and now much more user friendly. Most won't take advantage of that tool, but they will benefit from the new map and game variants that the hardcore create and share with the community. It's also incredibly simple to just hop in and edit the rules of the game, both for Firefight and in normal multiplayer games. You can tweak everything from which enemies you face in Firefight to how much damage weapons do, and a whole lot more. Think of a crazy game variant -- even one that doesn't have anything to do with shooting -- and you can probably make it and share it with your friends in Halo: Reach. The whole system is incredibly powerful and equally impressive. The only downer is that there is no way to search for a custom game. If a game type isn't in the predetermined matchmaking hoppers and you don't have friends online, you're out of luck. All told, the multiplayer suite is one of the best ever. The Halo multiplayer game has been expanding since the early days of the original Xbox, and now it's hit a point where the amount of , flexibility, number of modes, and potential for fun is just out of this world. Very few other games can compete with this level of polish, presentation, and attention to detail. And just when you think you've seen it all, don't forget to hop on to bungie.net to find extra stats, shared in-game screenshots and movies, and a vibrant community ready to help you extend the life of your game for months and months."
