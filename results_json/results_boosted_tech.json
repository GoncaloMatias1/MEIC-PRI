        "Content": "AMD has hit a stride with its RX 5000 series of graphics cards . With the launch of the RX 5700 , 5700 XT , and most recently the RX 5500 XT , the company aimed to provide the best value for the money in each card\u2019s respective price bracket. Today, we\u2019re looking at the 5600 XT, a card AMD describes as being the \u201cultimate graphics card for 1080p gaming.\u201d Priced competitively at $279 on the low end, is it finally time to upgrade?   Design and Features Like the 5500 XT, there is no reference version of the 5600 XT, so graphics card companies have been set free to design their own versions. Options are plentiful. As a gamer, you have your pick of factory overclocks, cooling solutions, and unique looks to match your setup. This approach also means that you\u2019ll have different pricing options that scale up with features and overclocks. As of today, RX 5600 XT prices range from $279 all the way to $309 for larger, triple-fan cards and high-end overclocks.  Even though AMD isn\u2019t selling its own card, the company still released reference specs for vendors to build on. The 5600 XT features 2,304 shader cores and a base clock of 1,130MHz. Under load, it\u2019s able to boost up to 1,560MHz with an expected Game Frequency of 1375 MHz, though this varies from game to game. The 5600 XT comes stock with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM running at 12GB/s for a total memory bandwidth of 288GB/s. At 1080p, few games demand more memory than that, so you should be able to max out textures without hitting a bottleneck on most games. The version we were sent for testing is the Sapphire Pulse OC. Like most third-party cards, it comes overclocked out of the box. The boost clock on this model can spin up to 1,750MHz under load and has an expected game clock of 1615 MHz. This increase is in thanks to a pre-release BIOS update which also increased the effective memory bandwidth to 14 GB/s. It also features Sapphire\u2019s Dual-X cooling solution which uses two large fans and a radiator to keep its components cool. Because there is no reference model and clock speeds and cooling will vary between cards, the actual performance of different models will vary. Differences shouldn\u2019t be major, but it\u2019s still worth considering your model carefully before buying.  For display support, the Pulse comes equipped with three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs and a single HDMI 2.0. Each offers support for high refresh rate monitors and HDR, as well as AMD FreeSync 2 to eliminate screen tearing. The 5600 XT is able to drive up to four displays simultaneously for immersive gameplay experiences. As an RX 5000 series card, it supports Radeon specific features like Radeon Image Sharpening and Radeon Anti-Lag. Radeon\u2019s Image Sharpening is the unstated hero of this generation of Radeon graphics cards, offering noticeable enhancements to the crispness of visuals without the performance hit of increasing the resolution. Radeon Anti-Lag is a boon to competitive gamers, reducing input lag by synchronizing the processing of the graphics card and processor . Another neat feature is Radeon Boost. It increases game performance by dynamically lowering the game\u2019s resolution when in motion. Because the game is in motion when it works its magic, it\u2019s much more difficult to spot. As game demands increase, this feature will help you keep frame rates smooth when they might otherwise stutter.   Performance To test the performance of the RX 5600 XT, I ran it through our stable of test games. Each game was set to the ultra presets or highest settings where that wasn\u2019t possible and anti-aliasing was disabled. We are currently in the process of updating our test bench, so this card was tested in my personal system. It is currently running a Ryzen 9 3900X with 32GB of 3600MHz G.Skill TridentZ Neo memory, and is free of any bottlenecks that would hinder performance. When the new bench is complete, I\u2019ll be retesting each of the cards below and many more to stay current with driver-based performance improvements. Note: I completed my testing using the latest driver and BIOS version available for the Sapphire Pulse. If you decide to pick up a 5600 XT for yourself, you should check to see if the manufacturer has updates available for your card to achieve the best possible performance.   Based on these results, it\u2019s clear that the RX 5600 XT is an outstanding card for 1080p gaming. In every case except for Shadow of the Tomb Raider , it was able to exceed 60 FPS at Ultra presets/max settings. By lowering some of the most performance heavy settings, these results could be increased further. It\u2019s especially interesting to see that the card offers very playable frame rates even at 1440p. Sapphire\u2019s Dual-X cooling also did the trick with the card never exceeding 75 degrees celsius in any game. Staying with Team Red for a moment, the card offers a major upgrade from the 5500 XT. This isn\u2019t surprising since the card is roughly $100 more, but if you\u2019re on the fence and can afford to wait, it\u2019s well worth saving up the extra cash. Compared to its closest competition from Nvidia, the GTX 1660 Ti , things become more heated. The RX 5600 XT consistently trades blows with the GTX 1660 Ti (and to a lesser extent the GTX 1660 Super ). With performance results like these, pricing matters more than ever. Our Sapphire Pulse version of the 5600 XT retails for $289.99 while the GTX 1660 Ti can be had for as little as $274.99. For my money, I would still lean toward the RX 5600 XT due to AMD\u2019s software enhancements, but in sheer FPS the 1660 Ti seems to be the better value. The battle for \u201cbest value\u201d doesn\u2019t end there, however. Leading up to the launch of the RX 5600 XT, Nvidia lowered the price of the RTX 2060 Founder\u2019s Edition to $299, and worked with EVGA to release a \u201cKO\u201d model for the same price that offers enhanced cooling. The RTX 2060 outperforms the RX 5600 XT in all but rare circumstances and includes the major feature of real time ray tracing, which the 5600 XT lacks. The value proposition is much trickier between these two cards. Ray tracing has the potential to offer much more realistic lighting in games, and both next-gen consoles have also been confirmed to feature it. With support coming on consoles (which often drive PC gaming tech), it\u2019s very likely that ray tracing will become a more major feature than it is today. While investing in the 5600 XT might save a few dollars upfront, if ray tracing is something you eventually want, it may lead to an earlier upgrade than just saving up for the RTX 2060. At the same time, Radeon Image Sharpening offers a definite improvement you can benefit from today. More than most GPU comparisons, this is really a case of what matters most to you, and is worth considering how that might change overtime.  Purchasing Guide The AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT is available at a starting price of $279. The specific version of this GPU we reviewed was the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5600 XT and it retails for a slightly higher $289 price at Amazon. Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5600 XT On Amazon See It"

        "Content": "Ratchet and Clank have been doing the whole \u201csaving the universe\u201d thing for quite some time, and their latest adventure, Rift Apart, amusingly acknowledges that right from the start. But the duo\u2019s age doesn\u2019t show at all thanks to an amazing outing \u2013 their first new one in nearly a decade \u2013 that is a gorgeous and expertly crafted example of what PS5 exclusives can look and play like. And even compared to great work building out a universe for Spider-Man , Rift Apart may be Insomniac\u2019s most emotionally resonant game yet. With more touching and clever writing that makes good on the promise of a multi-dimensional trip unlike anything the series has done before, Rift Apart makes old characters fresh and new additions so indelible it\u2019s hard to imagine the series without them. ...Even if \"Ratchet and Clank and Rivet\" would be a pretty long name. Whether you\u2019re new to swinging Ratchet\u2019s wrench or a veteran of the DreadZone, Rift Apart\u2019s mix of third-person shooting and platforming is immediately easy to understand. Ratchet has always been a series about exploration and combat, and thanks to the dip-free stability of the 30fps Fidelity mode, the latter in particular has never felt so good. And while I've only gotten to spend a bit of time with them so far, the Performance and Performance Ray Tracing modes are even smoother at a steady 60fps (watch our Rift Apart Performance Review below for direction comparisons that highlight the differences). I'm completely okay with sacrificing some of the visual effects on my Challenge mode run thanks to how well the higher framerate keeps up with Rift Apart's controlled chaos. That sensation of never slowing down is also thanks to the spectacular load times, which are, as promised, practically nonexistent. Whether you\u2019re jumping through rifts to a new location on the same planet or an entirely different one, or switching characters, I never noticed so much as a hitch, pause, or stutter. Some loads are cleverly hidden behind smart cuts and cutscenes, but for all intents and purposes, Insomniac has delivered a seamless adventure from start to finish. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask That\u2019s achieved despite the fact that this is the prettiest PS5 game yet, and one of the best-looking games I\u2019ve ever played. Insomniac has used its cartoony color palette to create a dazzling array of interstellar locations, like the densely packed metropolis of Nefarious City or the lush greenery of Sargasso that benefit from impressive use of ray tracing reflections. Back in the day we used to see \u201cRatchet and Clank looks almost like a Pixar movie\u201d comparisons; with Rift Apart, it has kept pace with much of the work in recent hits like Incredibles 2 and Soul (though Pixar\u2019s pre-rendered animation definitely has an edge in certain scenes). It\u2019s not just the varied vistas that frequently stopped me in my tracks, it\u2019s the little details \u2013 like the gears moving on the familiar Buzz Blade weapon \u2013 and the sheer variety of them. I didn\u2019t know I needed to see Ratchet\u2019s fur in such glorious fidelity, but the more advanced animations and 4K textures allow the entire cast to be more expressive than ever. This is the prettiest PS5 game yet, and one of the best-looking games I\u2019ve ever played. \u201c Rift Apart also gives Pixar a run for its money in its ability to tell an emotional story while also maintaining its excellent comedy. While it\u2019s the funniest game I\u2019ve played in some time, the writing strikes just the right balance between that comedy and the heartfelt, the silly and the sincere. Additionally, it\u2019s not obsessed with referencing past games to the point of alienating newcomers. I can only speculate here due to my own familiarity with the series, but I\u2019d bet that Rift Apart\u2019s best moments will land regardless of your experience with the pair\u2019s previous adventures, especially thanks to the multiverse concept that allows the developers to introduce new takes on familiar characters. It\u2019s through the exploration of the multiverse that we see the debut of Rivet, a playable parallel of Ratchet who proves to be one of Insomniac\u2019s best-written characters ever and yet another memorable performance from voice acting veteran Jennifer Hale (known for female Commander Shepard , among many others). A resistance fighter against Emperor Nefarious in her previously unseen own universe, Rivet is a strong-willed do-gooder, and you can certainly see the shades of Ratchet in her characterization. But Rivet isn\u2019t just a gender-swap; she\u2019s a distinctive personality all her own, with unique wants and hopes, including trust issues that come from years of fighting without a parallel Clank by her side. Where her story goes and how it\u2019s intertwined with Ratchet and Clank\u2019s quickly makes her a vital part of this series\u2019 DNA. While it\u2019s a little disappointing that Rivet doesn\u2019t get her own set of moves, it at least means you don\u2019t have to worry about upgrading and equipping the two protagonists independently when you land on a new planet and are automatically switched from one to the other. Rift Apart has a surprisingly deft approach to dealing with mental health topics. \u201c That\u2019s not to say the headlining duo gets the short end of the intergalactic stick. Ratchet\u2019s internal struggle over whether he actually wants to find the rest of his catlike lombax race looms large, while Clank\u2019s own sense of self-worth in the face of injury is moving. Rift Apart has a surprisingly deft approach to dealing with mental health topics among its entire cast in ways that feel honest and deep, and it\u2019s all wrapped up in this exciting, bright, and bubbly adventure. We\u2019ve gotten hints and teases about the existence of other dimensions before \u2013 with the Dimensionator specifically serving as a cliffhanger from 2013\u2019s Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus \u2013 but Rift Apart makes good on the multiverse idea in hilarious, charming, and even surprisingly touching ways. Sometimes it\u2019s played for laughs, like with alternate-reality takes on existing characters, and other times it\u2019s used in mechanically clever ways, such as when Ratchet or Rivet hop between two versions of the same planet to find pathways that are closed in one dimension are open in another, but also with more danger lying in wait. Pics Or It Didn\u2019t Happen Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart Photo Mode Screenshots 7 Images Rift Apart includes the series\u2019 first-ever photo mode, and after Insomniac\u2019s great work with this option in the Spider-Man games it\u2019s an excellent addition, especially given how beautiful these worlds are. I actually didn\u2019t spend a ton of time with it during my initial playthrough, but that was largely because I knew if I did I may never get around to actually playing. Rift Apart offers beautiful photo op after beautiful photo op, and the customization options \u2013 including changing out armor pieces, adding in light sources, and other standard features \u2013 makes it one of the most robust photo modes out there. The story is told via Rift Apart\u2019s world-by-world approach \u2013 that\u2019s a standard formula for the Ratchet and Clank series, but in this case a lot of work was done to make every planet unique, and each with its own stories and structure that\u2019s distinct from one another. Each world\u2019s story, incidental dialogue, and encounters feel tuned to the personality of whichever lombax you\u2019re controlling there: the furball Sargasso denizens you\u2019ll meet as Rivet are all named Mort and bring with them a kindly American midwest tone and accent to their conversations, while Zurkie's serves as an interstellar crossroads bar and battle arena for travelers like Rivet. Later planets play more with the multiverse idea in some surprising and genre-hopping ways, including one that draws heavily on some of the games Insomniac has made since the last time we saw Ratchet and is executed better than when Naughty Dog tried a similar thing with Uncharted . Each world also has a side quest outside of the main adventure, which allows for a bit more local color to be added and usually some more intriguing platforming sections to pull off. Later planets play more with the multiverse idea in some surprising and genre-hopping ways. \u201c The art direction at large allows the impressive level of detail to remain surprising throughout, thanks to the variety of worlds you\u2019ll explore. Yes, some interiors will share similar metallic, futuristic vibes, and gameplay-relevant surfaces like spots for your gravity boots to stick to will repeat so that they\u2019re instantly recognizable no matter where you go. But every world has its own visual identity that\u2019s a treat to discover, offering different tones, geography, and ensembles of memorable characters. What Visual Mode Will You Use in Rift Apart? Fidelity (4K/30 FPS) Performance Performance Ray Tracing Answer See Results Wacky Weapon Wheel Moment-to-moment gameplay also has new nuances for returning fans to explore. Ratchet and Rivet\u2019s movement has been fine tuned since the 2016 reboot on PS4, and simple additions like a beautifully animated dash move and wallrunning make a world of difference. It not only allows for trickier and more intricate platforming sections and more varied collectible placement, but it brings new nuance to combat as well. The dodge ability allows the lombaxes to phase through incoming attacks, and timing a dash just right to get in close and deal big damage is a consistent new thrill. Timing a dash just right to get in close and deal big damage is a consistent new thrill. \u201c Ratchet can do melee damage with his wrench (and Rivet with her hammer), but in Rift Apart I\u2019ve used his standard weapon a lot less frequently than I did in previous games thanks to the increased scale of battles. In Rift Apart, you need to be more clever with your use of the array of wacky weaponry, and the rifts scattered throughout come in handy for both battles and scouring the environment for collectibles. They\u2019re conveniently placed in most combat arenas to let Ratchet get to higher ground or cross the battlefield, and they saved me more times than I\u2019d care to admit. It\u2019s certainly reminiscent of jumping through a portal in, well, Portal , but the on-screen effect of the new location hurtling toward you coupled with the DualSense \u2019s haptics gives the mechanic its own distinct flair, while adding much more tactical variety to combat than the series has ever seen. It\u2019s never not cool to leap across the battlefield and leave enemies confused in your wake or surprised by your sudden appearance as you gain a momentary upper hand. The best uses of them certainly come during big action moments when rifts hurtle you far greater distances \u2013 namely, from planet to planet while mid-chase or boss fight. It\u2019s especially amusing to come across a later world and realize you saw it for a brief moment while dodging a massive robot\u2019s fists. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart - Every Weapon and Armor Set Revealed So Far 25 Images And Rift Apart\u2019s great arsenal of weapons let you make the most of those opportunities. Even though I miss some of my old series favorites like the Sheepinator and Groovitron, I have to give Rift Apart credit for some instant classics: the Topiary Sprinkler, for instance, transforms enemies into whackable weeds, and the Ricochet shoots a pinball-like pellet at enemies that, properly timed, can deal more damage on subsequent hits. That just scratches the surface of the more than a dozen options, and yet none of them feels redundant or superfluous. Because you\u2019re facing more enemies at a time than in the previous games, and often different combinations of them, I also found myself switching between weapons more than ever before. Yes, I\u2019d gravitate toward my favorites, like the powerful shotgun-like Enforcer, but if you\u2019re not taking advantage of crowd-control options like Mr. Fungi to fend off waves of smaller enemies like the returning Robomutts, or defensive weapons like the intriguing Void Repulsor to block fire from the reptilian Goons-4-Less and their constant barrage of blaster rounds, it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed. That\u2019s especially true when Emperor Nefarious\u2019 massive robotic minions, who shoot various lasers and rapid-fire energy bursts or wield giant mace-like arms, enter the fray. Accessibility Options After the great strides Insomniac made with accessibility options in its Spider-Man games, it\u2019s nice to see an even more varied group of options present in Rift Apart. I am by no means an expert or in the best position to fully know how useful each of these features actually is for those who need them, but the number of visual and audio adjustments you can make, all without affecting completion rates or trophies, is an important inclusion in such a large game. One that feels particularly useful is the ability to allow you to slow the speed of the entire game to make time-sensitive inputs like platforming and combat less frenetic and demanding. There are multiple speed levels to choose from, and it can be turned on and off at will if you only need it for a specific section or fight. For a deeper conversation about what Rift Apart offers, be sure to watch our spoiler-free Podcast Beyond discussion. These weapons are, of course, where you\u2019ll also get the most use out of the DualSense\u2019s haptics. Each weapon\u2019s firepower, from the wild booms of the Enforcer to the short blips of the Burst Pistol, is mirrored in the controller\u2019s advanced rumble. One of the most fun and frequent effects, though, is passing through a rift. As I threw out the rift tether to pull myself through space, the sensation of the rift coming closer to and then surrounding me was always neat in the midst of a battle\u2019s chaos. (The use of the adaptive triggers is a little disappointing \u2013 in the PS5\u2019s first six months , alt-fire for weapons being the difference between a half and full pull has been just about the only real use for them in a combat-heavy experience like this.) The sensation of a rift coming closer to and then surrounding me was always neat. \u201c Naturally, Rift Apart isn\u2019t all combat, as any action-platformer worth its bolts/coins/studs/rings/etc. will find ways to vary up gameplay. However, some of these segments were the only parts of the campaign where I felt the momentum was lost. For instance, there are occasional bits where Ratchet or Rivet have to hitch a ride on a speedy space slug to avoid poisonous waters; it\u2019s amusing the first time or two, but never really becomes anything more than getting from point A to point B. And aerial combat on the back of an intergalactic pterodactyl sounds awesome but it occurs only once and is fairly rudimentary. Neither idea is bad, per se, and they\u2019re only meant to be momentary diversions, but they stand out from the rest of the campaign because they don\u2019t quite match the ingenuity of nearly every other style of gameplay. Which of These PlayStation Series Would You Like to See Revived? Sly Cooper Jak & Daxter Ape Escape Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results To be fair, there are many other twists that fare much better. Clank has several physics-puzzle sections that require you to use the right combination of power orbs to move a series of ethereal Clanks along a pathway and fix interdimensional anomalies. None are particularly difficult to solve, but they quickly and consistently make me feel clever as I find the right path along which to speed up, weigh down, or lift up all these Clank copies as he waxes philosophic with another character about the journey, and his emotional state, so far. There\u2019s also a series of optional pocket dimensions hidden throughout Rift Apart\u2019s worlds which offer clever platforming challenges that will test your timing like little else, and a new battle arena where you can earn some extra upgrades in between story missions. Most of these battles have some amusing twists, too, like limiting you to a specific weapon or introducing a massive column of spinning blades that\u2019s constantly chasing you as you take on other foes. I looked forward to every Glitch sequence because of just how damn endearing their personality is. \u201c But one of my favorite additions is the introduction of Glitch, a spider-like robot whom Ratchet calls on to battle computer viruses, depicted as literal viral blobs and monsters infecting a number of technological pathways. These behind-the-back, third-person shooting sequences are relatively simple and become a bit rote by the end, since you\u2019re limited to either a quick burst fire or a series of more powerful rockets, but I looked forward to every Glitch sequence because of just how damn endearing their personality is. Glitch is neurotically self-aware, anxious, and wary of taking on bad guys, but their journey of self-discovery and finding the confidence to be a valuable team member, nudged along by Ratchet\u2019s encouragement, is positively charming. Rift Apart also includes a set of collectible armor sets that come in three parts, which can be mixed and matched on either Ratchet or Rivet. But more importantly, regardless of whether you ever wear one (which I didn\u2019t for my initial playthrough because I love the base character designs so much), collecting these sets will earn you some welcome stat buffs, like more damage against specific sets of enemies. Gold Bolts are also littered throughout the lands, and each one offers its own set of bonuses, including new photo mode options, weapon cosmetic options, and more. Attaching those rewards to them makes collecting the bolts much more engaging to collect along the journey, rather than just for post-game cleanup. Rift Apart\u2019s standard difficulty is a relatively breezy one. \u201c I eventually finished Rift Apart\u2019s campaign after about 16 hours, having completed 90 percent of everything, including those collectibles . Cleaning up the remainder should only take a couple more hours, but beating the story also unlocks the franchise-stalwart Challenge mode that amps up the difficulty substantially. That\u2019s a good thing, because Rift Apart\u2019s standard difficulty is a relatively breezy one \u2013 I may have died two or three times in battle. That said, I had enough close calls early on to really drive home the benefits of staying mobile, varying up my weapon use, and keeping an eye on ammo. What We Said About Ratchet and Clank (2016) Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years. It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for. - Marty Sliva, April 11, 2016 Score: 9 Read the full Ratchet and Clank 2016 Review The stunning graphics and excellent storytelling of that campaign are backed by Mark Mothersbagh\u2019s great score. It sounds like a cousin of his fantastic Thor: Ragnarok work, mixing familiar franchise themes with new orchestral takes and a series of synth-laden pieces that would have pleased Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Grandmaster. It matches the bombastic action when needed to, but some of my favorite tracks come amidst quieter character or exploration moments. I need it on vinyl, stat. The score never drowns out the bashing, shooting, and quipping that are core to Ratchet\u2019s gameplay, though. And while it all sounds fantastic on a home speaker system, this is yet another PS5 exclusive for which you\u2019ll want 3D-enabled headphones to get the full effect. Walking through Nefarious City, the chatter of passing bots and vehicles can be heard as they go whooshing by, while mid-combat you get a better sense of where every foe and friendly assistant is when you can\u2019t see them. The only truly disappointing aspect is that the 3D audio doesn\u2019t factor into gameplay more often, as the engaging setup led me to expect. There\u2019s a brief mission in Nefarious City that requires you to listen for the thumping beats of Club Nefarious to find your way through the city, and it worked so much better with headphones on. That cool example of integrating audio into gameplay made me want more."

As the lower powered of the two cards, the thermal load is naturally going to be less, so AMD was able to equip it with a standard two-slot heat sink. This is good news if your gaming PC also has internal sound or capture card because it will allow for more room to draw cool air through its fin stack.  Otherwise the two cards are nearly identical on the outside. The RX 6800 is still powered by dual eight-pin PSU connectors (no proprietary headers here!), as well as the same array of video outputs: 2x DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, each offering Display Stream Compression for those 4K HDR gaming monitors, one HDMI 2.1 output, and a USB Type-C output for easily connecting a virtual reality headset . Who said USB-C out on graphics cards was dead? It\u2019s only once you look under the hood that the differences begin to stand out. Like the RX 6800 XT, this card is built on AMD\u2019s 7nm process and features the same 26.8 billion transistor count, but it features a trimmed back processor and clock speed. In total, it packs 3840 stream processors and 60 compute units, each with its own Ray Tracing Accelerator for hardware-based ray tracing. This is roughly 17% less each, while also being 50% more than last generation\u2019s AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT . Given the relative performance of each card, that actually lines up quite well. When it comes to clock speeds, the RX 6800 features a \u201cGame Clock\u201d of 1815MHz and a Boost Clock of 2105MHz. Again, this is a more modest promise than the 2015 MHz and 2205MHz of the RX 6800 XT, but a noteworthy improvement over the RX 5700 XT\u2019s 1755MHz and 1905MHz. As has been the case for years, these figures should be taken with a grain of salt as each card will intelligently ramp itself up beyond these limits so long as it stays within acceptable power and thermal limits. For example, when gaming, my sample would routinely clock itself up to 2275 MHz and hover there. It\u2019s not quite the 150MHz boost I found on the RX 6800 XT, but the top speed remains impressive compared to Nvidia\u2019s current RTX 3000 line-up, which often hover between 1900 - 2000MHz.  Another highlight the RX 6800 shares with the RX 6800 XT is its large store of video memory. Each card features 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 256-bit bus. With a bandwidth of 512 GB/s, it\u2019s a far cry from the ridiculous 760 GB/s speeds offered by the Nvidia RTX 3080 \u2019s GDDR6X, but is perfectly sufficient for 4K gaming. Since this card is squarely targeting 1440p, standard GDDR6 is a good choice, as is the generous capacity featured on both cards. Compared to the 10GB on the RTX 3080 and 8GB on the RTX 3070, 16 gigabytes feels downright exorbitant and offers the kind of headroom that will give both RX 6000-series cards ample headroom for the advanced textures and graphical effects always around the next bend in PC gaming. Of course, the Radeon RX 6800 also brings with it all of the improvements of AMD\u2019s new RDNA 2 architecture. I give a thorough breakdown of the improvements in my review of the RX 6800 XT, so you can read the full breakdown there, but there are a few important high points that allow this card to be more than meets the eye. First, instead of using a dedicated core just for ray tracing, each compute unit has its own ray tracing accelerator. Every clock cycle, each CU is able to process four ray intersections. This allows the system to be scalable while also offering a massive improvement over software level ray tracing. Additionally, you should be aware that RDNA leverages Microsoft\u2019s DirectX ray tracing solution, DXR, and not RTX. That\u2019s important, because certain games that are designed explicitly for RTX will not work on the RX 6800 or 6800 XT. Second, each announced RX 6000-series card features a brand new store of GPU-level memory called Infinity Cache. This cache allows the GPU to store important data rather than pull on the VRAM, which reduces latency and increases effective bandwidth. This memory store is also a key reason for the impressive clock speeds the GPU is able to deliver, and aids in the increased performance per watt. This card, despite being far more advanced than the RX 5700 XT, has a TDP of only 250 watts, 25 watts higher than the 5700 XT.  Third, the RX 6000-series is synergistic with the Ryzen 5000 CPU platform through a new system called Smart Access Memory. If you\u2019re running one of AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen CPUs on a 500-series motherboard, your CPU will be able to access all 16GB of the RX 6800\u2019s VRAM for a boost in performance. AMD claims this averages to about 6% but can be more depending on the game in question (their documents show Forza Horizon 4 receiving a 15% improvement at 1440p, for example). Since our test bench is built on the Intel platform, I wasn\u2019t able to test this for myself, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect a modest performance bump by the function of this new system. There is lots more to RDNA 2, including game- and performance-enhancing features like Radeon Boost and Radeon Anti-Lag, as well as boons to content creators like HEVC encoding/decoding and AV1 decoding, so be sure to head over to the RX 6800 XT review and take a look.   AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Performance  Test system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply. With all of that preliminary information out of the way, it\u2019s time to take a look at how the card actually performs. All of our cards are put through a series of synthetic tests and real world gaming benchmarks. Since AMD seemed to be taking aim at the RTX 3070, I\u2019ll be focusing mainly on 4K and 1440p gameplay, but also note 1080p results in our initial game tests. As I mentioned above, our system is unable to take advantage of Smart Access Memory, so if you\u2019re running a system composed of a Ryzen 5000 processor, AMD 500 motherboard, and RX 6000 GPU, you can expect a roughly 6% increase in performance.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Synthetic Benchmarks   Looking at synthetic benchmarks, the RX 6800 performs very well. It outperforms the RTX 3070 handily and comes in just below the RTX 3080.   Turning to ray tracing, I ran each card through Surgical Scalpels\u2019 Boundary Benchmark as well as 3DMark\u2019s Port Royal and Ray Tracing Tests. Here, the RX 6800 performs significantly below the RTX line-up and RX 6800 XT. This is to be expected because of its position on the product stack and, in the Boundary benchmark in particular, demonstrates the importance of a scaling solution like DLSS. Without that, the RX 6800 offered only 36% of the performance of the RTX 3070. In 3DMark\u2019s ray tracing test, where neither card was able to benefit from DLSS, the results were closer, but the RTX 3070 still led the RX 6800 by 48%. AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Gaming Benchmarks 5 Images When it comes to normal rasterization, the RX 6800 does very well, going head to head and even beating the RTX 3070 in several cases. At 1440p, it\u2019s able to maintain 60 FPS in three of the five games above, with the exceptions being Metro Exodus , which was 55 FPS with also had RTX on high, and Red Dead Redemption 2 which was 58 FPS. Compared to the RX 5700 XT, the gains are very large, with an average improvement of 52% at 4K, 58% at 1440p, and 49% at 1080p.  Since the card is positioned so directly against the RTX 3070, which was itself compared directly to the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti , I opted to do some expanded testing, beginning with 4K. As you can see, in non-ray traced games, the card does a good job of keeping pace with the RTX 3070. In fact, removing Wolfenstein: Youngblood from all calculations (ray tracing is exclusive to Nvidia, so AMD\u2019s figures are not comparable), it averages 10% faster than the RTX 3070 and only 15% slower than the RX 6800 XT. Once ray tracing is factored in and Nvidia\u2019s cards are able to take advantage of DLSS, that lead evaporates. The average performance across all games (except Wolfenstein) puts it 12% slower than the RTX 3070. Is it fair to compare ray tracing performance between AMD and Nvidia when RTX cards have DLSS and AMD cards do not? I would argue that it is as that is exactly what many gamers will do when considering between the two. AMD seems to know as much, because it\u2019s developing its own answer to Nvidia\u2019s AI upscaling system: FidelityFX Super Resolution, but little is known about this technology other than that it is in development. When it will arrive and how it will work is anyone\u2019s guess. The reality of Nvidia\u2019s lead is hard to ignore here because most games supporting ray tracing also support DLSS. Even though the RX 6800 offers good performance at 4K and below as we\u2019ll see in a second, the absence of such a system is a significant drawback at launch. Comparisons and resolution scaling aside, I was impressed at how well the RX 6800 was able to handle non-ray traced games at 4K resolution. In my testing, leaving ray tracing turned off increases FPS by 40-50%, allowing many games to perform near or even above 60 FPS.   Looking at 1440p, which I would argue is the target resolution for this card, we see a similar story in comparative performance, but here it\u2019s even more valuable to look at the actual FPS in each game. Even with ray tracing turned on, most games I tested performed well above 60 FPS. Of those that fell below, two were very close (Metro Exodus averaged 55 FPS, Battlefield V was 57) and only two were unplayably low: Control and Minecraft RTX . It\u2019s also worth calling out just how well Dirt 5 performed even without DLSS. Dirt 5 appears to be optimized for AMD, and the RX 6800 cleans the RTX 3070\u2019s clock as a result. Given that current-gen consoles are also being built on the RDNA 2 architecture and will utilize ray tracing, I\u2019m optimistic at what this means for the future of ray tracing on AMD cards. Of course, if you\u2019re not interested in ray tracing, these results are also very good news. If you\u2019re gaming at 1440p with DXR disabled, the RX 6800 is able to run many games at or above 100 FPS.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Thermals and Acoustics The new triple fan design is an improvement versus the blower style cooler of the previous generation. In my testing, the RX 6800 reached a peak temperature of 80C. This is definitely warmer than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3000-series GPUs, but since AMD determines throttling based on a junction temperature (hottest spot on the die) of 110C, it didn\u2019t actually result in any throttling that I observed. The card is also noticeably louder than Nvidia\u2019s most recent cards, rising above my PC fans for a clear rise and fall as the card would spin up and down. In short, the thermal solution works, but still lags behind the competition in temperatures and acoustic performance.

        "Content": "From the first honk of the series\u2019 iconic countdown klaxon, there are moments during Gran Turismo 7 when it feels almost like a remake of the 1997 original. In the space of a moment I\u2019m 16 again and stuffing earthshaking turbos into a bright red Mitsubishi GTO, wondering how I\u2019m going to be able to beat my dad around Trial Mountain when he always gets the DualShock and I have to make do with our only other controller \u2013 a terrible, translucent blue aftermarket job with no analogue sticks. That\u2019s a kind of magic a video game series can\u2019t buy; it can only earn. Gran Turismo 7 has that magic; that compulsive car upgrade loop the series established, plus the hot looks and sterling handling to back it up. But there\u2019s a lot more to Gran Turismo 7 than the sum of its nostalgia \u2013 even if there are still a few traditions it should\u2019ve left in its rear-view mirror. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Nostalgia isn\u2019t a requirement, though: Gran Turismo 7 is the most welcoming GT ever, with dozens of hours of curated races and tasks designed to induct a new generation of players into the classic GT experience. GT7 achieves this via the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9, an eccentric but effective little hub that the developers at Polyphony have placed right in the middle of its world map. When we drop in, the caf\u00e9 owner assigns us specific races and tasks via a series of 39 so-called \u201cmenu books.\u201d Working through those gradually introduces new drivers to how things work in GT \u2013 from earning licences and finding and buying cars, to customisation and racing. Some of it may initially seem like busywork to long-time GT players, but the racing events the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9 deliberately threads us through all make up part of the large list of career races we\u2019d be otherwise doing anyhow \u2013 and the decent collection of reward cars offered for working through the menu books makes it well worth your time. Gran Turismo 7 is the most welcoming GT ever. \u201c You\u2019ll definitely be able to win many more cars this way than you\u2019d be able to afford to buy in your first week with GT7, that much is clear. Payouts aren\u2019t particularly extravagant and car upgrade costs can be surprisingly high for some items, like tyres that cost twice as much as an entire MX-5, or $100,000 nitrous systems no amount of boosted DVD players would ever pay for. Even neat ideas, like the huge range of official manufacturer paint colours we can use in the design booth, annoyingly come with a cost attached. Microtransaction Reaction Update, March 7, 2022: Since the publishing of Gran Turismo 7\u2019s reviews Sony has flicked the switch on its microtransactions and the news is as we suspected \u2013 and, in some ways, much worse. As it appeared, GT7 is based on a direct cash-for-credits scheme (as opposed to GT Sport\u2019s microtransaction functionality, which allowed players to purchase individual cars valued up to 2 million in-game credits with real money instead of in-game credits). US PSN prices for GT Sport's cars. This means instead of being able to purchase cars individually, which in GT Sport range in price between US$1 and US$5, players tempted to accelerate their GT7 car collections by using real money need to shell out for batches of in-game credits. There are four tiers of credits available: 100,000 credits \u2013 US$2.50 / \u00a32 / AU$3.75 250,000 credits \u2013 US$5 / \u00a34 / AU$7.55 750,000 credits \u2013 US$10 / \u00a38 / AU$15 2,000,000 credits \u2013 US$20 / \u00a316 / AU$30 GT7's credits are shockingly expensive. There are several glaring problems associated with this new approach to microtransactions. At a basic level, the limited set of tiers means there\u2019ll regularly be no way for a player to purchase exactly the amount of credits they may want for a particular car. Just want 1 million credits? Well, you\u2019ll have to spend US$15 on packs of 750,000 credits and 250,000 credits, or US$20 on twice as many credits as you wanted. It\u2019s a pretty gross approach considering all these cars are on the disc already and very much part of your initial purchase. At a fundamental level, though, these credit prices are simply out of control. For example, if you wanted to fast-track your way behind the wheel of a 2014 Lamborghini Veneno in GT Sport, you could pay US$5 and purchase this car direct from the PS Store. But in GT7 this process is now rendered hideously more expensive. To purchase the Veneno in GT7, which costs 3,640,000 credits in-game, you\u2019d need to hand over US$40 (\u00a332/AU$60) for 4 million GT bucks \u2013 a 700% increase! These aren\u2019t microtransactions anymore; they\u2019re maxitransactions. Again, these aren\u2019t even DLC add-ons, either; these are vehicles that are in the game already. It's especially dismaying that the full scope of this new cash-for-credits scheme was only revealed after the review process was completed. Yes, it is an optional shortcut, but considering credits build fairly slowly via racing, you can\u2019t sell cars from your garage, and a number of GT7\u2019s coolest cars have been made artificially scarce, at what point do we call it predatory? With rare cars in the legendary dealer rotating in availability before they\u2019re \u201csold out\u201d (and unobtainable to you in your single-player game), and others that require peculiar, time-limited, in-game invitations to actually purchase, it\u2019s definitely easy to see how some players who know they won\u2019t have the time to build a large amount of credits by racing may be compelled to part with real cash to snag certain cars before they\u2019re gone. Original, March 2, 2022: Gran Turismo 7 features the shady ability to top-up your in-game credit balance with real money via the PlayStation Store. At the time of publish the link to do so directly from the various purchase screens in-game is not functioning, so we're unable to see how much credits cost. It would seem that this is a different approach to the microtransactions added to GT Sport in 2018 (which was around a year after it was reported it would not feature microtransactions ). The microtransactions added to GT Sport allowed cars to be directly purchased a la carte for real money; GT7 appears to be a cash-for-credits scheme. Either way, GT7's microtransactions have me feeling a bit cynical overall, especially considering how hard GT7 leans into making some of its coolest cars artificially scarce. Some rare cars will only pop up occasionally to buy before they're \"sold out\", and others require peculiar, time-limited, in-game invitations to actually purchase. It's easy to see how the fear of missing out may coax some players who are light on credits to shell out real cash to grab certain cars before they disappear again. Nevertheless, collecting each themed trio of cars for the GT Caf\u00e9\u2019s menu books (like European classic compacts, or retro Japanese sports icons) also unlocks a sweetly earnest short video that showcases the cars and explains their relevance to automotive culture. These vignettes are clearly aimed at people with a more limited background in motoring history than I have but I still admire Polyphony\u2019s efforts to try and add context to why certain cars are here. That said, while some of these collections are very historically robust and can properly chart the lineage of certain iconic models, some others are hamstrung by GT7\u2019s limited pool of cars to pull from. For instance, GT7\u2019s Supra and GT-R collections are great examples of menu books that span decades of motoring evolution, but others have to take a bit more of a grab-bag approach. GT7\u2019s car roster exceeding 400 sounds good on paper (and it surpasses the nearly 350 that 2017\u2019s GT Sport ended up with after several years of updates) but accounting for multiple variations of the fantasy Vision GT cars, the race car versions of road cars, and then the reverse \u201croad car\u201d versions of some of those race cars, that 400 figure shrinks a bit. It\u2019s really only around half the cars available in Forza Motorsport 7, the crosstown rival racer it originally inspired. The reality is the garage in GT7 is not nearly as rich as you may expect \u2013 and certainly not as current. With a few exceptions, most manufacturers\u2019 ranges tend to top out at around 2017. If you\u2019re expecting to see quite a few high-profile cars from the last two or three years here, like the latest McLarens or any Tesla built since 2012, you may be disappointed. Gran Turismo 7 Launch Screenshots - March 2022 102 Images Handle with Flair Crucially, however, the car handling is quite impeccable \u2013 and virtually every single car I\u2019ve driven feels appreciably different from the last. Retro road cars feel lairy and loose, and they can become wilder still with some extra oomph squeezed under the bonnet as proper performance tuning returns to the series after its absence from GT Sport. Modern sports cars feel a bit more planted but they\u2019re nothing like the dedicated race models, which are stiff and cling to the tarmac like their tyres have talons. In what feels like an improvement on GT Sport, grip doesn\u2019t quite disappear off a cliff the moment I overcook a corner exit. I\u2019ve found I\u2019m able to drive out of trouble more often after perching a car in a slide. I have my reservations about the off-road handling \u2013 specifically how it deals with jumps \u2013 but GT7 is amazing on asphalt. Like GT Sport before it GT7 seriously sings on a steering wheel (I\u2019m using the Thrustmaster T-GT) but know that it still feels absolutely at home on a DualSense controller, and I haven\u2019t felt like it\u2019s a disadvantage; in fact, I\u2019ve achieved gold cups in the bulk of the license tests using a controller. I have found the weaker of the two countersteering assists useful in some vehicles because it takes some of the dramatic edge off my car\u2019s bulk snapping from side to side \u2013 something that can be a little tricky to intuit with only the tiny amount of travel possible on an analogue stick compared to a wheel \u2013 but if you require more assists GT7 features plenty of them, all the way up to full auto-braking. GT7 may be a serious racer, but it\u2019s not an entirely inaccessible one. What We Said About Gran Turismo Sport Gran Turismo Sport is a very well-crafted online racing destination. It\u2019s serious, sensible, structured, and \u2013 unlike Sony\u2019s previous first-party racing game, DriveClub \u2013 it\u2019s been reliable since launch. It\u2019s also supremely good-looking, well-presented, and handles great. However, the hard pivot to an online-focused racing sim has seen it lose a slab of its single-player mode, it lacks meaningful weather effects, and its garage and track selection is startlingly stingy next to the competition. \u2013 Luke Reilly, October 18, 2017 Score: 7.5 Read the full Gran Turismo Sport review The PS5 DualSense\u2019s haptic feedback also rates a positive mention. There are times where it feels like it\u2019s trying to deliver a few too many sensations simultaneously to really grasp what each is trying to illustrate \u2013 so it\u2019s just a lot of whirring and buzzing, all at once \u2013 but the DualSense otherwise copes with GT7 splendidly. The response to curbs is particularly nuanced, and there are some other bits of feedback that are unique to particular tracks that feels very cool \u2013 like the whirr from whipping over the metal grates that stretch across the Tokyo expressway circuit. That this buzz feels distinct in my hands from the clunk of a gear change is exactly the type of thing I\u2019m keen to keep seeing done with the DualSense. It remains a shame that Polyphony keeps compromising its high-quality driving by persisting with frustrating rolling starts for career mode events. \u201c However, it remains a shame that Polyphony keeps compromising its high-quality driving by persisting with frustrating rolling starts for career mode events, repeating the same mistake GT6 made. In a real-life motor race, cars cruise closely in two rows for rolling starts. But in GT7 career races, the cars are arranged in single file, 50-odd metres apart, and we are always placed in last. In a race with 20 opponents at Mount Panorama, this means the leader is already all the way up Mountain Straight and approaching the Cutting by the time we cross the starting line. In simple terms, that\u2019s well over a kilometre away . These ridiculous head starts mean career events are less a race than they are a chase. We\u2019re not dogfighting for track position with backmarkers; we\u2019re simply blazing past them trying to negate the immense starting deficit. The racing really just amounts to an overtaking challenge, which GT7 already officially has a bunch of in its addictive set of driving mission challenges. What\u2019s mystifying is that GT7 has a great and extremely granular custom race creator that features grid starts so we know there\u2019s no technical reason not to have them. It just\u2026 doesn\u2019t use them where they\u2019d work best. Tracing Game Starting out in GT7 on PS5 you\u2019ll be offered the choice between two graphics modes: a performance mode that prioritises the frame rate at all times, and a ray tracing mode that applies ray tracing to certain non-gameplay scenarios (you can switch between them at any time). Ray tracing can be active in things like the photo mode, replays, and the garage, but I honestly don\u2019t feel the juice is worth the squeeze. With ray tracing on the camera tends to jitter a bit when panning across interiors, and I actually think the cars tend to look sharper and better without it. In fact, GT7\u2019s greatest lighting victory has little to do with its ray tracing mode at all: its fantastic time-of-day effects bathe the fabulous set of circuits in supremely realistic and always-changing light. Watching as the crisp afternoon sun gave way to the pink and purple hues of dusk atop Mount Panorama I was seriously impressed; it\u2019s distractingly good. GT7\u2019s dynamic time-of-day and weather effects aren\u2019t a genre first but they have finally pushed its tracks to the next level \u2013 and they\u2019re doubly cool when applied to returning original GT circuits like High Speed Ring, Deep Forest, and fan favourite Trial Mountain. GT7\u2019s dynamic time-of-day and weather effects aren\u2019t a genre first but they have finally pushed its tracks to the next level. \u201c It's just a great-looking package all around, really. I quite like the smaller details, from the way the pit crews clamber up fences to pump their fists and wave flags on the last lap in championship races to the way tow hooks, decals, and unique aero parts begin to naturally appear on tuned AI opponents as you move up through the competition ranks. Those aero parts are the result of a neat wing editor that allows us to select from different end plates and wing heights rather than make do with a small handful of presets, and they\u2019re just one of a bunch of innovations hidden in GT7\u2019s cosmetic and performance customisation. I\u2019m a real fan of the straightforward detuning that\u2019s now possible in the settings screen; it\u2019s now much easier to keep your most-loved cars on track when performance limits fluctuate between events by simply adding ballast or turning down the engine computer (rather than heading back to the garage to strip off parts to make something race legal). Everything Must Go While the Gran Turismo Caf\u00e9 is a clever experiment that works, GT7\u2019s new music features \u2013 which were a large focus of February\u2019s extensive GT7 reveal \u2013 feel like a bust. They\u2019re both let down by an ostensibly large music library that ranges from mostly forgettable to outright weird. What's the Gran Turismo series' greatest driving tune? Everything Must Go (Chemical Brothers Remix) - Manic Street Preachers Lose Control - Ash My Favourite Game - The Cardigans Are You Gonna Go My Way (Gran Turismo Remix) - Lenny Kravitz Just a Day - Feeder Kickstart My Heart - M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce Reason Is Treason (Jack Knife Lee Remix) - Kasabian Panama - Van Halen SURV1V3 - Daiki Kasho Planetary (GO!) - My Chemical Romance Other: tell us in the comments! Answer See Results The Music Replay feature works as advertised \u2013 and I understand that the race replay cameras are being generated around the track dynamically depending on how fast my car is travelling and switching in time with the music \u2013 but the effect isn\u2019t particularly seismic or stirring. Music Rally, an arcade-style mode where we start with a certain number of beats which tick down as a song plays and need to be topped up by passing through extension gates, has turned out to be a particularly odd focus. \u201cQuirky\u201d is the polite way to describe it, but \u201cbaffling\u201d is probably the more accurate. It\u2019s admittedly hard for me to gauge how a 2022 audience will respond to hustling around a track to classical disco megamixes from 1982, but personally I\u2019m confused as hell here. It\u2019s hard to gauge how a 2022 audience will respond to hustling around a track to classical disco megamixes from 1982. \u201c Most disappointingly, for a series with a baked-in history of associated music tracks that are seared into the minds of millions, this wasn\u2019t the direction Polyphony went with Music Rally. It gets frustratingly close, with one of the songs in Music Rally plucked from the opening movie to the PAL version of GT5 Prologue on PS3, but that\u2019s it. A Music Rally mode stacked with songs from the heyday of Gran Turismo, like My Favourite Game by The Cardigans, The Chemical Brothers remix of Everything Must Go, or any of the Ash, Feeder, and Lenny Kravitz tunes that made up those early intro movies and soundtracks? That would have been a very clever hook. As it stands, though, the six currently available Music Rally events are mostly a bit bizarre and boring. Even more confusingly, it\u2019s one of only two modes that function offline. Like GT Sport before it, everything else in the single-player mode (except an arcade mode with a tiny selection of cars) requires an online connection. That you can\u2019t access online multiplayer in this case is obviously a given, but the fact you can\u2019t even access the two-player mode offline has me stumped. That needless connectivity isn\u2019t as big a problem for most people in 2022 as it was a few years back but it\u2019s still something to be aware of. While the PvP online component was really the crux of GT Sport, GT7 doesn\u2019t emphasise it in quite the same way, letting the single-player campaign flex its muscles. With rotating, scheduled racing and championships, Sport mode in GT7 still functions the same as it does in GT Sport, though, so I fully expect it\u2019ll be a similarly strong online racing venue. GT7 also adds some more low-stakes multiplayer options, including lobbies where players can meet up on most of the circuits, tool around with no specific race settings, and just chat, compare cars, and cruise. These may descend into bedlam following GT7\u2019s launch, but I think the idea is sound."

Fortunately, Insomniac has retrofitted Peter Parker\u2019s adventure with all the outstanding tech it developed for Miles, including improved lighting and frame rates, ray-traced reflections, lightning-fast load times, and DualSense haptic feedback. And they replaced Peter\u2019s face\u2026 which is weird, but at least it showcases the major improvements to facial animations. This is a game that was already worth replaying on PS4, but now that it\u2019s on PS5 it\u2019s a great time to revisit New York and see it at its best. Back in my original Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man review, I called it Great, highlighting its awesome swinging through of New York City, its excellent Peter Parker story, and battles with familiar villains. I griped a bit about some suit powers being way better than others and the repetitive optional missions being a drag but it\u2019s overall one of the best superhero games ever made. Every IGN Spider-Man Review Ever 34 Images Two years later, all of that remains true, even next to the open-world side mission improvements I just played in the amazing Miles Morales adventure. Insomniac\u2019s original Spidey tale is still a great Peter Parker adventure, even with a new face, featuring a great clash between the lives Peter leads both behind and out of his mask. And yes, it\u2019s certainly jarring at first to see that face appear instead of the PS4 version, but I pretty quickly grew accustomed to this new look. Now I\u2019ve come to like it more than the original. It looks more age-appropriate and more in line with the boyish but confident charm of Yuri Lowenthal\u2019s memorable performance. His take on Peter still stands tall as one of my favorites, buoyed by Laura Bailey\u2019s still-wonderful Mary-Jane, William Salyers\u2019 broken Otto Octavius, and more. Re-experiencing Insomniac\u2019s story has delighted me as much as it did the first time around, particularly in the wonderful first moments of Peter and Mary-Jane on screen together, Spider-Man\u2019s friendship with Yuri Watanabe, and some of the bigger personalities of Peter\u2019s foes. Improved facial animations, less plastic-y skin, and realistic hair tech add more realism to the chemistry between Peter and MJ, with a satisfied smirk betraying Peter\u2019s hope that they\u2019ll get back together, as well as the despair Otto experiences when his lab is shut down. It\u2019s a big step up.   Looking Back: What We Said About Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 \"I was left delighted at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is an excellent set of webswinging mechanics, which -- combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense sequences. Insomniac\u2019s first foray into the realm of Marvel superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world and combat are only occasionally caught up in a web of overly familiar trappings.\"  Characters benefit from the re-done lighting system, and so does everything else it touches. From beautiful moments at dusk as the sun fades, to indoor interiors of Fisk Tower using the building\u2019s many modern light fixtures to more realistically brighten the space, everything just looks more beautiful. And married with ray traced reflections in the fidelity mode, New York comes alive in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible on the PS4. I mean seriously: it has turned one of Spider-Man\u2019s most common tasks, stopping a car chase, into a beautiful light show of neon signs reflecting off cars and buildings as I chased the thieves and webbed them up all through the city. It\u2019s as shiny and bright as strolling through Times Square at 2AM actually is, all without the real-life headache you probably have...if you\u2019re strolling through Times Square at 2AM. The DualSense is used pretty much exactly as it is in Miles Morales, which is excellent in helping to translate the sensation of playing as Spider-Man in more detail than ever before. I may never get the sensation of webslinging in real-life, but the DualSense\u2019s haptic vibrations, trigger resistance, and a subtle \u201cthwip\u201d from the controller\u2019s speaker do an admirable job of recreating what I imagine it\u2019d be like. Likewise, if you have a 3D audio headset like the Pulse 3D, you get a nice extra level of immersion as the sounds of sirens go by in the distance and angry New Yorkers tell you to watch where you\u2019re going as you run by on street level. But of course, my soundbar still does a perfectly good job of capturing the layered sounds of Insomniac\u2019s New York as I swing through the streets. Do You Like Peter's New Face? Yes, more than the original Yes, but not more than the original No, I prefer the 2018 model Indifferent, it's under a mask most of the time Answer See Results Even if you\u2019ve already beaten or even platinumed it on PS4, I\u2019d recommend checking out how much more vibrant Insomniac\u2019s New York City is. It\u2019s a different time of year than Miles Morales\u2019 Christmas setting, so it offers a different enough visual palette even though I\u2019d just played that game. And all the fun of the gameplay is still there: Peter\u2019s swinging and acrobatic combat flows just as well as I remember, and even more smoothly now when you choose the new 60fps performance mode (which sacrifices some of the nicer lighting effects). I still find myself leaning heavily toward my few suit mod preferences and the side missions aren\u2019t any more diverse \u2013 I\u2019ve already run into what feels like a few dozen muggings \u2013 but that\u2019s remasters for you. The remaster also has all the benefits of bundling all three DLC episodes of The City That Never Sleeps. That\u2019s another 10 or so hours of play, and it adds a largely satisfying comic book mini-arc that includes fantastic character work with Black Cat and Silver Sable. You take the bad with the good in the form of the annoying Screwball missions and a less-than-stellar second chapter, but these episodes work much better together than they did as separate episodes released a month apart as they were originally. Anyone can wear the mask, and it\u2019s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy into its games. \u201c On top of that and the free suits Insomniac put out, the remastered edition has been enhanced with quality-of-life improvements, like the near-instantaneous load times on PS5, and even additions to Photo Mode to mirror the handy new lighting features of Miles\u2019 version. Plus, Miles Morales\u2019 huge suite of accessibility features have been added (something I\u2019m kicking myself for neglecting to mention in my Miles review). There are options to change the contrast of the environment, enemy readability, quick-time event requirements, and much more. It\u2019s a nice step up from the original\u2019s included options. And if recent Spider-verse stories have taught us anything, it\u2019s that anyone can wear the mask, and it\u2019s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy into its games."

        "Content": "With Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down. Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of the series yet \u2013 but stand the original alongside this sequel in other ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each other. The excellent combat hasn\u2019t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others. Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2\u2019s combat is very familiar \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have that new suit smell anymore, but it still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision dodges, the new perfect parries (so you\u2019re not only swerving and striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling pins \u2013 but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to commit crimes again. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Overall, there\u2019s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine, this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than spreading them out to pick them off one by one. A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber \u2013 which pulls enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another \u2013 also playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this before landing a sharp burst of Miles\u2019 Venom lightning onto grouped-up goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match Miles\u2019 satisfying electric abilities. They\u2019re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar \u2013 filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges \u2013 and is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost. Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety. \u201c One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you\u2019ll no longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats. New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes. Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle to fights. It\u2019s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added level of complexity that makes you consider which powers \u2013 or even which Spider-Man \u2013 are best for a given job. That's not to say there aren\u2019t benefits to taking a sneaky route, though, especially when you\u2019re playing as Miles and using his invisibility power to quietly take out enemies. There are many perch takedown possibilities offered and new toys to play with too, such as the Web Line, which allows you to create your own highwires over your enemies to prey on them from above. It\u2019s a fun tool that allows you to reshape the tightly designed arenas into a battlefield more in your favour, and in doing so, redecorate the room with web-wrapped people pi\u00f1atas. On the other hand, much like combat, stealth isn\u2019t a far cry from the many warehouse encounters you\u2019ll have played in the previous games, as you clear out enemies using largely the same techniques. Performance Review - Fidelity Mode Vs Performance Mode on PS5 Spider-Man 2 is, on paper, the perfect sequel. It takes all of the elements that made the first games so much fun and builds and improves on them. Bigger battles, improved ray tracing, wider story choices, more flamboyant combat, dual characters, improved visuals, staggeringly fast and dense city travel are all excellent. The sheer wow factor it delivers will impress, but some of the shine is dulled by comparison to Insomniacs own previous success and work on the remasters of the original and Miles Morales for PS5. Going from the original PS4 or even PS4 Pro Spider-Man games to this is a night-and-day difference in almost all areas, with the most noticeable being seamless loading, ray tracing, AI muscle deformation, vast performance increases and visuals that push the PS5 hard. But from the PlayStation 5 updates, the leap is smaller, if still impressive. None of this diminishes the excellent, varied and amazing game within, but just how amazing that is depends on when you last slipped into the tights of New York\u2019s favourite web head. \u2013 Michael Thompson, October 16, 2023 Read the full Spider-Man 2 Performance Review On the topic of covert ops, the playable MJ sequences from the original return, and while they are more involved this time around and serve the story well, they never add up to more than simple stealth missions or splashes of basic third-person shooting. She\u2019s certainly not sidelined, but it does feel like a little more could\u2019ve been done to make her gameplay sections a bit more exciting \u2013 or at least more in line with her established character as an intrepid investigative reporter than the missions she\u2019s sent out on here. Combat aside, our Spider-Men can now swing around their friendly neighborhoods in more stylish ways than ever, with new spins and flips added to the repertoire providing a Tony Hawk-like edge. Performing web acrobatics is as gratifying as you remember, and still one of the best ways to get around any open world. The new web wings are undoubtedly a standout, however: like Batman before him, Spider-Man can now glide and soar with ease through the city, but not without limits \u2013 you\u2019ll need to get the hang of managing your altitude and forward momentum, with the aid of windy corridors through the city that can quickly carry you from one district to the next. What's your favorite superhero video game series? Insomniac's Spider-Man Rocksteady's Arkham Marvel vs. Capcom LEGO Marvel Telltale's Batman Other (Tell us in the Comments!) Answer See Results The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. \u201c The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. It's undeniably a fun time to don the suit and enter a Kratos-like rage mode where you push in both thumbsticks and start one-hitting everything in your path, but the writers never once forget to take their eyes off of the humanity inside these superhumans. The same can be said for both its heroes and villains, as Spider-Man 2 tackles the reasoning behind each character's actions and the good that can hide in the shadows of evil. For those with a hazy memory, there is a brief recap of both Peter and Miles\u2019 stories so far available, which is handy, as this is very much a sequel that weaves in both plotlines and characters from the previous games and accompanying DLC. You won\u2019t want to jump in for the first time here since Spider-Man 2 builds on the first two games both in its mechanics and its story \u2013 but of course, there\u2019s little reason not to, since those games are also excellent. Avoiding spoilers, the basic premise revolves around Kraven the Hunter, who is, well, craving a hunt. For those uninitiated in the character, he's essentially The Predator, an Apex hunter blessed with super strength who has chosen New York as his next hunting ground. It's a great starting point that sends the city's hero and villain dynamic into flux as he sets his sights on the biggest prey possible.

Both Spider-Men tackle the most extreme examples of trying to manage a work/life balance you can imagine, exploring a range of personal issues including strained relationships and loss that plague us as humans, no matter how superpowered we may feel. It's the best-written story in the series yet (if still a bit cheesy at times), with performances worthy of the script. It\u2019s a real triumph that it manages to cover such a wide spectrum of themes without suffering from tonal thwip-lash. A particularly memorable mission under the dancing lights of Coney Island\u2019s amusement rides is a highlight that manages to impressively capture the story\u2019s essence and bottle up its emotional tension before emphatically smashing it. Primarily a Peter Parker story, Spider-Man 2 explores his relationship with MJ and the reintroduction of childhood best friend Harry Osborne into his life. It\u2019s always compelling to watch him contend with which pieces of the past to leave behind and what future self he wishes to be. In some of the missions where you control normal, everyday Peter, I couldn't help but feel the Uncharted influence more than ever, both in the techniques it uses to tell his story and the show-stopping action sequences when he slips into the suit. No matter how hectic a scenario gets, though, he always has a quippy one-liner ready to be expertly delivered by actor Yuri Lowenthal. It's the best-written story in the series yet, with performances worthy of the script. \u201c Miles still gets his time in the spotlight, however, and has some fantastic moments towards the end of the main campaign, even if some of the more interesting explorations of his Puerto Rican/African American culture are reserved for side missions. Obviously, what you take away from the story and its diverse cast of characters will be unique to you. On the surface, it's another thrilling superhero story packed full of surprises, cameos, and Easter eggs \u2013 but there are deeper meanings to be found here, too. Spider-Man 2, and to an extent all great Spider-Man stories, tackle themes of adolescence and puberty \u2013 a time of uncertainty for even the most normal of teenagers trying to control bodily fluids. We join Miles at this exact point in his life, with family ties straining, friendships facing fresh challenges, and life decisions of genuine importance being posed for the first time. Actor Nadji Jeter displays all the range needed for the role, continuing to excel as a younger Spider-Man maturing before our eyes. For Peter, these themes manifest in a much more physical sense. He's in his early twenties so has already navigated the difficult years that Miles finds himself in, but thanks to the symbiote suit, he's working his way through yet more bodily changes. This physical manifestation is also representative of mental health issues that have developed for each Spider-Man. Venom hangs over the main characters like a spectre of grief, drenching them in black as if in a state of mourning. The story does a great job at gently exploring these issues and how, when not healthily addressed, personal demons can eat at us and lead to people we care about being unintentionally caught in the crossfire of the anger and pain those feelings can produce. Of course, a hero is nothing without its villains, and Spider-Man's rogues gallery is almost unparalleled. Outside of the likes of Venom, Kraven, and Lizard seen in the trailers, Insomniac has kept many more cards hidden up its sleeve. I won't even hint at any of these except to say that Spider-Man 2 opens with a bang, offering up a sense of scale not previously seen in the series. It's an adrenaline-fuelled reintroduction to the series that tests how well you remember the combat, as well as providing a few new tricks. It's also the start of one of the new side-story villain threads that are optional, and while those don't offer anything overly new in terms of gameplay, they do add valuable extra scraps of story. They flesh out these villains, allowing fully formed characters to emerge where once they were merely one-and-done boss battle appearances. A tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. \u201c Speaking of boss battles, that\u2019s one area that takes a noticeable step up from our initial tangos with Kingpin, Vulture, and the rest. One of my criticisms of the first in Insomniac's series was how uninspired many of the showdowns felt, with their quicktime-heavy fights making a light impact. Improvements were made in Miles Morales, but here in the full-fledged sequel, boss battles really come to life. You're made to wait a little too long for them sometimes, but when they do arrive they never fail to excite. They are evolving brawls packed full of danger that put all of your skills to the test. Dodges and parries are key, as well as using environmental tools dotted around the arenas for your benefit. The latter third of the campaign essentially becomes a boss rush mode that will put the sturdiest of thumbs to the test \u2013 not necessarily because it ever gets too difficult, but because of the sheer number of times you\u2019ll be hammering that Square button. These later stages are where the majority of Spider-Man 2\u2019s thrills lay, however, as it really hits its stride late on, and emphatically wraps up a tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. Spider-Man 2 Rogues Gallery 6 Images The main story took me around 18 hours to complete before I hit 100%, and the subsequent platinum trophy popped up to congratulate my efforts after 27 in total. To earn that precious trophy, you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time mopping up the many, many side activities that Spider-Man 2 throws your way \u2013 and while not everybody must or should do all of that, it\u2019s a reminder that quantity doesn\u2019t always equal quality. Despite whatever loftier ambitions the story may have, this is still unapologetically an old-school approach to open-world game design, and nowhere is this displayed more clearly than in its optional quests. To their credit, the way you can highlight side objectives by pressing the right stick is a welcome upgrade over mere icons on a map. Even without that, you can spot ominous clouds or glowing purple rooftops with the bare eye signaling activities are there to be found. This isn't a world that beckons exploration or discovery, necessarily, but it is a step in the right direction toward creating greater immersion and mercifully less time spent looking at the map screen. It\u2019s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac\u2019s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content \u201c That being said, I can't help but have hoped for a few more flashes of Gotham City to make their way into New York. Something like the spontaneous shock of Manbat jumping at you out of nowhere went a long way to making Rocksteady's superhero open world feel more reactive than what we get here (even though it always cheated by finding ways to keep civilians off the streets). When you consider the evolution of open-world game design that the Arkham series took over the course of the trilogy, and its multilayered villain side quests, it\u2019s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac\u2019s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content and the way it presents itself to you. Standard open-world filler activities are here aplenty, and that\u2019s one area where Spider-Man 2 hasn't moved with the times or shown ambition at all. Collectibles, photo opportunities, and rather basic street crimes are still here and, despite having a few slightly more interesting quirks this time around, they only very occasionally excite. You\u2019ll regularly be stopping the same getaways with the same few button presses (the button-mashing from previous games is mercifully largely gone) or stopping a break-in by battering the same few goons. Granted, the additional enemy variety in play makes these activities take a little longer to get old than they did in the past, but that still isn't quite a strong enough twist to make prioritising photographing a couple of amateur cosplayers over saving a house full of people from a raging fire not seem ridiculous. Fun, quick side missions like helping a student ask their crush to homecoming or rescuing the Brooklyn Visions\u2019 mascot from a rival school by solving a series of light and mirror puzzles add dashes of charm, but I'd love to see yet more life breathed into this world to match its visual splendor. These characters do add a bit more flavour to the world and its largely homogenous population of NPCs you\u2019re clearly not intended to look at too closely. There are exceptions to the rule, however: there are a couple of more involved questlines that are much more nourishing, almost to the point of being a series of mini main plot missions. My favourite was The Flame questline, which begins with simply helping out the fire brigade, but quickly spins a layered and mysterious web. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises, like a great, short comic book run that separates itself from the rest of Spider-Man 2\u2019s optional time trials and simple puzzle minigames. Rewards for completing these various activities vary, with some ranging from genuinely exciting story teases for what\u2019s to come, to simply gaining some tech parts to upgrade your abilities with. The tasks are often so mundane and repetitive, however, that I did frequently question whether these small, congratulatory nuggets were worth the slog they too often turned out to be. Top 10 Spider-Man Games 11 Images All of this contributes to fighting back against crime in each district of New York, a city now twice the size of what we\u2019ve seen before including the leafy residential roads of Queens and the bustling borough of Brooklyn. There are 14 unique districts, each with its own set of objectives to complete before you can unlock fast travel to that part of the map. Not making fast travel readily available is smart, and truthfully, I barely used it anyway as swinging and gliding around the city is so much more fun, even though the load times are nonexistent and the speedy, swooping camera effect of switching between Peter and Miles is very cool. Gliding is especially great for crossing long distances thanks to the numerous wind tunnels that carve their way through New York's seemingly endless grid of streets flanked by art deco architecture and modern mirror-like skyscrapers. Of course, if you\u2019re going to be catching your ray-traced, 4K reflection (if you opt for the 30fps fidelity mode) in that glass so often, you\u2019ll want to look your best. Fear not, because there are dozens and dozens of suits to unlock, with myriad colorful skins to pick from on each of them. From modern interpretations of classics to returning fan favourites, there are treats waiting for Spider-Man fans of all generations. They are now all pure cosmetics as well \u2013 a smart separation of form and function means picking the skills and abilities you equip are separate from your choice of suit. In keeping with Insomniac\u2019s track record, the music behind it all is stellar. \u201c In keeping with Insomniac\u2019s track record, the music behind it all is stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my playthrough. In fact, Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel as a whole. From the near-instant load times, the ability to pinpoint a fast-travel location and be there in a second, atmospheric lighting, and crisp reflections, all of the pieces fit into place wonderfully \u2013 aside from the very occasional NPC getting stuck where they shouldn\u2019t. I can't say that I noticed one dropped frame in my dozens of hours of playing. This allows Spider-Man 2 to shine in its most jaw-dropping moments \u2013 of which the main story offers many \u2013 as explosive action, sparkling electrical effects, and fittingly slimy symbiote gloop fill the screen."

Just as Vice City on PS2 was a trip down 1980s memory lane with plenty of pastel pink and not-so-subtle references to films like Scarface, this celebratory 10th anniversary iOS port also takes us down a video game memory lane. Nostalgia-ception! In an age of distinct open-world games like Batman: Arkham City, Skyrim and Far Cry 3 it\u2019s interesting to remember that this wide-open structure was still truly revolutionary in 2002. This iOS port is the complete Vice City experience. Gamers play as Tommy Vercetti, famously voiced by Ray Liotta, in 1980s Vice City, a fictionalized version of Miami. Tommy rises to the top of Miami\u2019s criminal underworld in a story more than a little reminiscent of Tony Montana in Scarface. All the missions, expertly-acted cutscenes, vehicles (over 100) and spot-on soundtrack selections (several hours worth) are present. All of the bad found in Vice City returns along with the good, however. Expect to repeat very lengthy and boring driving sections any time you fail a mission. Also expect to spend an inordinate amount of time simply driving to and fro to activate missions. The city itself, which seemed to so perfectly capture the 80s vibe 10 years ago, now looks blocky and empty. Vice City has not aged as elegantly as many games from the early 2000s era. The iOS port\u2019s improved graphics do help to button up Vice City\u2019s visual fidelity. On Retina Display devices Vice City iOS pushes revamped character models, lighting effects and high-res textures, but don\u2019t expect a miracle \u2013 this is still the same 10-year-old Vice City, just sharpened up. The framerate largely holds up, even in moments of intense action, besides when transitioning from one island to another. Here the game can hitch for sometimes seconds at a time, presumably as it loads in the new geometry. Even with a console controller in hand, Vice City could sometimes be tricky to control. Driving, shooting, pulling the E-break to slide around a corner\u2026 it\u2019s a complex and full-featured game system that uses a lot of buttons. There\u2019s simply no way around it. Thankfully, unlike the iOS port of GTA3, this time around players can fully customize the on-screen virtual buttons. After wrestling with the controls for a while I made the fire and steering buttons larger and moved less important buttons like the car horn out of the way. It helped make the experience much more controllable. An improved auto-aim system also help ease potential control frustrations. Yes, moving, aiming and firing aren\u2019t ideal, but generally speaking if you point Tommy towards an enemy and pull the trigger your bullets will find the right mark. In some ways it makes some of Vice City\u2019s shootouts a little too easy. But since most people will likely pick up this port just to faff about the city itself, it seems right to err on the side of generous auto-aim. ",

        "Subtitle": "Solid port",
        "Content": "Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes diverges from series\u2019 conventions in numerous ways, most notably in its open-ended approach to stealth, and minor enhancements to the interface improve this on PC. Ground Zeroes\u2019 main mission, a rescue op to free two captured allies, isn\u2019t very long, but the vast compound in which it\u2019s set allows for diverse play styles that are emphasized in smart, silly, and satisfying unlockable objectives. IGN\u2019s original reviewer Lucy O\u2019Brien illustrated what makes Ground Zeroes a great stealth-action game. She explained, \u201cGround Zeroes is so adept at generating tension that at times it felt like I was playing a survival horror game. While [main character Big Boss] has never been more flexible; able to roll and jump and shoot in line with today\u2019s top third-person action-adventure games, enemies are smart and plentiful. In the harsh light of day - and played on Hard mode - they possess cruel 20/20 vision, and react to every little movement or shifting shadow by becoming more efficacious in their patrolling.\u201d On PC, this tension can be amplified by minimizing the HUD elements -- disabling visual notifications cleans up the screen, makes Ground Zeroes more challenging, and leaves more room to appreciate its commendable visual fidelity. It exceeds even the terrific graphics of the new-gen consoles on maximum settings; the rainy nighttime map is gorgeous, with slick roads reflecting the glaring lights of truck headlights, and characters\u2019 clothing dripping in the storm. The daytime variant highlights different high-quality lighting effects, with immaculate environmental detail creating a convincing sense of place. I found myself reducing the screen-filtering effects to minimize the default, sometimes overbearing blur and depth of field, however; this caused the foreground to look too washed out, like the camera is way out of focus. The frame rate is uncapped, but locking it at 30fps allowed for more reliable performance when cranking up the model, texture, and shadow detail on an older PC, but Ground Zeroes is stunning on a respectable rig -- I played mostly on a Core i5-4670 and a GTX 780, with 8GB RAM) -- with no need for compromise. Keyboard and mouse controls work well with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, but a controller is slightly stronger for stealth precision. It\u2019s more similar to Splinter Cell: Blacklist than any other Metal Gear game, using an analog stick to measure walking speed has more precision, but it\u2019s adequate using WASD and customizable, all of which can be set to your preference. The PC version is content-identical to the console versions, which means Ground Zeroes\u2019 ending remains tonally problematic, with a tone-deaf and brash representation of violence that\u2019s never earned. It attempts to hit a darker point for the series, but its discomforting violation is misguided, gross, and hopefully a one-time thing.",

Forza Motorsport\u2019s online multiplayer spec racing should technically place all these cars on a level field, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ve brought a cricket bat to a swordfight here. Several mediocre laps later and neither myself or my Vegemite-eating VF Commodore have troubled the timesheets much, finishing mid-pack one spot below where I started \u2013 but I\u2019m sweating, and I\u2019m smiling. The 2023 version of Forza Motorsport is brimming with new features across the board, from its muscular new multiplayer to its much-improved handling. All except for its upgrades, that is. They\u2019ve been downgraded. Confused? Me too. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Forza Motorsport is, by a significant margin, the best feeling game in the Motorsport franchise to date. It isn\u2019t necessarily a total reinvention of the Forza formula, and it still has that familiar level of forgiveness baked into it when you\u2019re at and just  beyond the limits of control. This is a series that has always been about letting us have the confidence to grab a car by the scruff of its neck and step the rear end out with a boot-full of throttle without constantly over-rotating, and that\u2019s absolutely still the case here. The improvements before we break traction, however, are marked. If the previous game, Forza Motorsport 7, has any noticeable handling blemishes, it\u2019d be that there\u2019s often a lack of bite to the feeling of grip. Six years later, that\u2019s totally gone here in this follow-up. The feeling of grip in Forza Motorsport is far more pronounced and authentic, and cars feel more realistically rooted to the road than they ever have previously. Push beyond the capacity of your tyres and grip will now taper away instead of falling off a cliff, meaning cars squirm more and skate less \u2013 which is a great improvement. Push beyond the capacity of your tyres and grip will now taper away instead of falling off a cliff. \u201c The pleasing side-effect of these terrific tyre modelling improvements goes beyond making racing feel more accurate; it also actually makes it feel easier to drive fast. \u2018Easy\u2019 is too often used as a pejorative in a gaming context but, with respect to those who can\u2019t feel feelings until they\u2019re being flayed alive by a FromSoft game, in racing terms I can assure you it\u2019s not a contemptuous concept. Lapping as fast as the pros, millimetre perfect and at maximum attack? No, that\u2019s not simple \u2013 if it was, we\u2019d all have yachts in Monaco by now. But hustling around a track quick and hard, confident the car beneath you is going to behave as it should? That\u2019s well within the means of a competent driver. The old sim racing mentality that \u201cif it\u2019s not difficult, it\u2019s not realistic\u201d is something that most good driving simulators have been moving away from for some time, and Forza Motorsport is no exception. It\u2019s easier because it\u2019s more authentic. Gamepad handling is extremely well-refined. While it\u2019s hardly a surprise considering good gamepad handling has always been a staple of this long-running series, I\u2019m happy to report it remains top-notch and has survived the physics updates beneath the surface. As usual, the team at Turn 10 has struck a terrific balance between softening things like rapid weight transfer and certain steering inputs to keep the handling tameable on a tiny analogue stick, but still demanding an indisputable deftness to drive consistently fast. On a wheel, my experience is limited to the Thrustmaster TS-XW Racer \u2013 but it definitely errs extremely heavy out of the box. \u201c On a wheel, my experience is limited to the Thrustmaster TS-XW Racer \u2013 but it definitely errs extremely heavy out of the box. Surprisingly so, in fact. The last time my actual car felt this heavy to pilot it was because my alternator failed and killed my power steering. It is, however, extremely tuneable \u2013 so I was able to eventually dial that aggressive heaviness out and enjoy what I otherwise consider the best Forza Motorsport wheel feel I\u2019ve ever experienced. There might be a slight numbness to severe kerbs, but the responsiveness and stability is excellent. The feeling of car weight is also great \u2013 especially on undulating and technical track sections like cresting over the rise at Laguna Seca before slamming down through the corkscrew. There are some small, welcome touches for wheel users, too. Those who play in cabin-view with the wheel visible may be happy to see the steering animation is no longer locked to just 90 degrees in either direction. The on-screen wheel now rotates up to 360 degrees, which is far more realistic. There are also car-specific force feedback and steering lock settings in the tuning menus, making it easier to keep cars feeling right without constantly re-adjusting the global settings. Level: May Cry There\u2019s more good news on tuning, including a new layer of suspension settings as well as the ability to add ballast. Adding ballast obviously increases car weight and lowers its performance index overall, but it is automatically distributed throughout the car to bring it closer to a perfect 50/50 weight distribution. It\u2019s impossible to instantly gauge the impact the addition of ballast will have on competitive car builds, but it will be interesting to watch and experiment to see whether pushing a car over the limit before handicapping it with extra weight is a viable strategy on certain tracks. Unfortunately, that\u2019s currently where the positive news on tuning \u2013 or perhaps more specifically, customisation \u2013 largely stops. That\u2019s because upgrades are no longer all immediately available for any car by default, like they are in Forza Motorsport 7 or Forza Horizon 5. Instead, they\u2019re frugally rationed out for each car as you spend seat time in them and earn experience for that specific vehicle. They\u2019re also no longer purchased with credits, either; rather, each car will have a set amount of \u2018Car Points\u2019 that applying upgrades eats away at. The amount of Car Points you have per car will be determined by each car\u2019s individual level, which tops out at 50. Upgrades are always made available in the same order, but it takes several hours of driving to unlock things like engine swaps (40), body kits (45), and drivetrain swaps (50). It takes several hours of driving to unlock things like engine swaps, body kits, and drivetrain swaps. \u201c By design, this overtly RPG-style approach is meant to encourage us to form more profound connections with a narrower assortment of cars that mean something to us personally instead of bouncing around. In practice, however, it\u2019s just a bit bothersome. Sure, it never feels as trivial as, say, the luck-based upgrade systems under the hood of arcade racers like The Crew series or Need for Speed Payback; we\u2019re still in control of the parts we choose to \u201cpurchase\u201d and fit. And sure, at car level 50 with the full range of parts available, the upgrade system in Forza Motorsport is essentially the same as it\u2019s been for generations. The problem is getting there is now an unexpected treadmill, for every individual car (including duplicates of the same car). Every IGN Forza Game Review Ever 17 Images I do appreciate Forza Motorsport\u2019s \u201cbuilt, not bought\u201d philosophy, but the new layer of gamification here isn\u2019t really for me. It\u2019s not so much the Car Point system itself \u2013 I actually think there\u2019s a decent amount of merit in some kind of system that\u2019s perhaps roughly analogous to time sunk. Anyone who\u2019s ever spent time wrenching on a car will know that you can\u2019t do everything at once, and Car Points do mean you have to slowly add and swap parts over time \u2013 just like in real-life. What I don\u2019t really get is the concept of gating away upgrades in a strict order \u2013 especially the super straightforward ones. Why do we really need a certain car level before we can yank out the spare wheel to shave some kilos? It definitely dilutes the previous freedom we had to focus on the upgrades we predict would make the most meaningful difference to a car\u2019s performance from the outset, and it\u2019s all bit silly that I\u2019m measuring fuel loads by the millilitre to slice bonus thousandths of a second off my lap times when I\u2019m still lugging around a spare tyre in the boot. Fortunately, you will earn car levels anywhere you use them... so you\u2019re never spinning your wheels on progression as long as you\u2019re driving. \u201c Fortunately, you will earn car levels anywhere you use them, whether that\u2019s career mode, free play, or multiplayer, so you\u2019re never spinning your wheels on progression as long as you\u2019re driving. The career mode is made up of several tiers of themed racing events that are otherwise fairly typically categorised by car class for this type of racing sim. With compulsory practice sessions ahead of each race it takes quite a while to move through each tour, so I\u2019ve been busy for a while and will continue to be for some time. The ability to select your specific place on the grid before each event may seem like a peculiar replacement for qualifying, but it does mean that you can have the exact racing experience you want each race. That is, if you want the old-school, Gran Turismo-style experience that\u2019s more like an overtaking challenge than a race \u2013 where you\u2019ll need to thread your car all the way to the front from the back of the pack in just a few laps \u2013 go for it. If you\u2019re interested in faster AI and dogfighting all race for a single spot, that\u2019s also possible. It\u2019s a smart touch, and it\u2019s a more robust single-player racing experience than the likes of GT7 as a result. What We Said About Forza Motorsport 7 Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it\u2019s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10\u2019s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak. \u2013 Luke Reilly, September 30, 2017 Score: 9.2 Read the full Forza Motorsport 7 review. That said, I have found the event intros are a little overblown; there\u2019s a hushed reverence to them that car manufacturers probably love, but they\u2019re pretty stiff and starchy compared with the more casual automotive culture shows I stream or watch on YouTube these days. There are also a few car categories that don\u2019t seem to really get much of a run in the career mode, but I would expect the career mode to grow as this Forza Motorsport platform evolves. In the meantime, free play is still here \u2013 where you can do quick races in any of the 500 available cars \u2013 but again I\u2019d really love some simple options to better curate what the AI drives against me. There are so many specific fields to edit to narrow down your opponent\u2019s cars, but it\u2019s all but impossible to get the 23 specific rival cars you want. Often it just ignores my custom settings entirely. Just let us place the AI in cars we choose, like Forza Motorsport 4 did. Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? Forza Motorsport\u2019s 500-car roster is slimmer than Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 5 \u2013 both of which feature over 700 apiece \u2013 and, yes, there are probably conversations to be had. For instance, there\u2019s been pruning when it comes to offroaders, and hot pick-ups like the GMC Syclone and the HSV Maloo appear to have been collateral damage. Lancia is MIA despite making a welcome return to Horizon 5 just last month. You could pick at the seams for some time. However, to be quite fair, Forza Motorsport does achieve this 500-car figure without the cheeky level of double, triple, and sometimes quadruple dipping some of its rivals do when it comes to counting certain models multiple times due to different paint jobs. It really still is an enviable roster of rides, all of which bark and crackle brilliantly thanks to some serious strides with the sound. Better still,  there\u2019s no shortcut to buy them with obscene amounts of real-world money: pay attention, Gran Turismo 7. Forza Motorsport does achieve this 500-car figure without the cheeky level of double, triple, and sometimes quadruple dipping some of its rivals do when it comes to counting certain models multiple times due to different paint jobs. \u201c They also look sharp and marvellous in motion. I played largely in Performance RT mode on Xbox Series X, which adds ray-traced reflections of other cars and nearby objects to the glossy surfaces of your vehicle at the cost of resolution (but not frame-rate, which never budged from 60fps). That said, I\u2019ve probably missed out on a good portion of the visual feast here since I don\u2019t typically play the Motorsport games in chase cam. If you favour 4K above all else, Performance mode drops ray-tracing during racing (and still runs at a resolute 60fps). A third mode packs in additional ray-tracing on other environmental objects but runs at 30fps. But hey, don\u2019t scoff: so does Driveclub, and look how well the aesthetics of that have stood the test of time, even a decade later! It ultimately may come down to personal preference, and I don\u2019t know whether overall Forza Motorsport quite has the measure of GT7, but damned if it doesn\u2019t look particularly spectacular at midnight under heavy rain. Each of Forza Motorsport\u2019s 20 track locations features support for dynamic time-of-day and variable weather, and they definitely have been dressed with more detail than ever before, with 3D crowds and more trackside objects and fixtures. It is a slimmer selection than the 30+ locations we had in Forza Motorsport 7, although it has been confirmed further tracks will be injected in the future for free. Yas Marina is coming back next month, another unannounced track will follow in December, and the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife will reportedly be ready by spring in the northern hemisphere, 2024. Still, no Bathurst right now? That Bath- hurts . No Bathurst right now? That Bath-hurts. \u201c Equally painful is the lack of two-player splitscreen, which is a mode my kids and I have traditionally had a massive soft spot for. They particularly love zany handicap races, like giving away massive head starts to ancient hatchbacks and then chasing them down in hypercars \u2013 which is precisely the kind of experimentation that sandbox racers with garages as exhaustively broad as Forza Motorsport is usually brilliant for. I presume splitscreen is simply a niche mode in 2023 and it probably comes at too high a performance cost on the Series S, but it really is a little gloomy whenever gaming seems to go backwards. Hell, Gran Turismo had splitscreen in 1997! What was the greatest era of motorsport? 1950s and earlier 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000-today Answer See Results The trade-off here is a massively improved online multiplayer component, with scheduled racing events packaged up as full race weekends, with a practice session, a three-lap qualifying blast, and a race. There\u2019s spec racing, where all the cars are automatically tuned identically by Turn 10 for an even playing field, and open racing where you take your own builds. I\u2019ve been playing the Touring Car and GT spec racing series over the past week and it\u2019s been extremely robust and reliable, especially considering the pools of players I\u2019ve been racing have largely been developers and other press located on the other side of Earth\u2019s largest ocean. It\u2019s a little hard to predict just how civilised it\u2019ll remain after launch, but the safety rating should hopefully keep dirty racers away from clean ones. I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of enough bad collisions to gauge just how effective the improved penalties are in actually disciplining the right players effectively, but I\u2019ve had mostly great, clean races so far. Perhaps my favourite new touch from the multiplayer, though? The ability to skip to the end of a lap in the pre-race sessions (or when attacking times in the asynchronous Rivals mode). Messed up a corner? The Skip Lap option will respawn you on a flyer, just a few corners from the start line. It\u2019s such a clever time saver."

While we still have some four months to go until we can get our hands on God of War III, the wait is being made a little bit easier with the release of the God of War Collection .  This compilation contains both God of War I and II ported over to PlayStation 3 code. This means that you don't need a backwards-compatible PS3 to play them as the collection is actually a native PlayStation 3 title, despite the content being completely untouched. While the games remain identical to their original releases, one big thing here is that they both now run in HD, and simply because of the resolution bump, they've never looked (and even played) better.   Click the image to watch our full video review. As I mentioned, the core games remain identical to their original releases. The textures, models, animations and everything else are exactly the same that you'll see on their PlayStation 2 counterparts. Rather than trying to improve a diamond, Bluepoint and Sony Santa Monica left the content alone, and I for one am pretty happy about this.  Now, one element of gameplay that has changed very slightly is that both titles feel smoother to play thanks to the increased framerate. While God of War I and II both ran pretty well on the PS2, their framerates weren't perfect and there was screen tearing aplenty. There's none of that here, and because of it, Kratos feels a tiny bit more responsive. It's a subtle difference, one that you might only be able to notice if you've played the original versions recently, but it is indeed a nice improvement.   The boss battles remain some of the best in gaming. Given that God of War I and II have been out for years now, there's not really much new that I can say about the gameplay, though it's certainly worth mentioning that both titles hold up very, very well. Both games are every bit as fun as they were upon their release, and despite having finished both of them a couple times already, I still had an absolute blast slashing mythological beasts over and over again. Even compared to other games on the PS3, the scale and scope of the experience is virtually unmatched to this day. If you want to know the nitty-gritty details of the games, read our original reviews for God of War and God of War II .   One bit about both games that hasn't aged well, however, are the cutscenes. There are two types of videos that play during the game: those that are entirely CG and made to look as nice as could be, and those that were rendered using in-game assets to look as close to gameplay as possible. The CG scenes still look very nice, though the video could be a little crisper (they're still standard-definition). However, the cutscenes that use in-game assets look pretty bad compared to the HD visuals of the gameplay, and the jump between the two can be pretty jarring. On the plus side, it'll make you appreciate how good the games look now, but that's just silver lining on a graying cloud.   The resolution increase is immediately apparent. Fans of the franchise know that God of War I and II both included plenty of behind-the-scenes content and videos, and all of that is wholly intact. The content that shipped with God of War I was viewable inside of the game (it's in the actual code rather than being a standalone video), so that's still the case. The downside is that you don't really have any controls, so you can't rewind, pause or anything like that. The stuff for God of War II, on the other hand, is viewable under the Video tab in the Xross Media Bar, so you have access to the same controls that you do for DVDs, Blu-ray discs or downloaded videos, which is great.  In both cases, like some of the in-game cutscenes, the video has not aged well. The content is all great and definitely worth watching, but you might want to don a pair of Vaseline-covered glasses beforehand.   The God of War franchise practically defines epic. "

I'm happy to report that Naughty Dog has successfully brought PlayStation 3's single best game -- The Last of Us -- to PlayStation 4 in the form of The Last of Us: Remastered. (You can read my full review of 2013\u2019s The Last of Us on PS3 here .) It\u2019s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it\u2019s worth your undivided attention whether you\u2019ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time. Sure, we may not have really needed a port so quickly, but then again, The Last of Us isn\u2019t just any game. As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better. The biggest change Remastered brings is its framerate. The original version of The Last of Us pushed the PlayStation 3 to its absolute limits to pull off 30 frames per second at 720p resolution, but the PlayStation 4 runs Remastered at 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution. It\u2019s a jarring change at first, but one that I began to appreciate the more I played. If you don\u2019t agree, Naughty Dog has included the option to lock the framerate to the original 30, but it was flipping back and forth that made me really begin to see the contrast. It\u2019s hard to explain how much of a difference the 30-to-60 transition makes until you see it for yourself; the PS3 original frankly looks a bit choppy by comparison. Doubling the framerate doesn\u2019t only provide an obvious aesthetic boost; it enhances gameplay, too. The most hardcore competitive shooters on consoles \u2013 like the Call of Duty series \u2013 run at or near 60 frames because it makes the shooting that much more fluid, responsive, and accurate. You\u2019ll see similar effects in The Last of Us: Remastered during gun battles, even if they are (or should be) few and far between. (Remember: this is largely, though not entirely, a stealth game.) The PlayStation 4\u2019s extra horsepower also gives a boost to The Last of Us\u2019 graphical fidelity. Now, I know that\u2019s not necessarily saying a whole lot, considering The Last of Us on PS3 is already the most beautiful game I\u2019ve seen on any console. But somehow, Remastered looks just a bit better. Textures are more detailed, the lighting is enhanced, and everything pops more. The changes aren\u2019t mind altering \u2013 or even game changing \u2013 but you can absolutely see the difference. From the moment I started the campaign, I couldn\u2019t help but notice improvements everywhere. Some are far more minor than others, but they\u2019re there, and they make The Last of Us burst with even more life. You can really soak the beauty in with Remastered\u2019s new Photo Mode, which allows you to take control of the camera, alter visual settings like focus and filters, and more to grab the most gorgeous shots possible. It\u2019s not uncommon to encounter stunning sights in The Last of Us \u2013 like when you first enter environments reclaimed by nature with Joel and Tess near the beginning of the game \u2013 and now, you can capture those moments for posterity, if you\u2019d like. Another notable change from PS3 to PS4 is, as you might expect, the controller. Naughty Dog knew the weaknesses of the DualShock 3\u2019s terrible triggers, which explains why aiming and shooting was unconventionally mapped to R1 and L1. DualShock 4\u2019s far superior triggers don\u2019t suffer from a similar problem, so you can map shooting to R2 and L2 if you want, or keep it as it originally was. Your backpack menu can be brought up with the DualShock 4\u2019s meaty center button, too. And, like Killzone: Shadow Fall, the controller\u2019s speaker can be used to play audio diaries and sound effects like the on/off click of your flashlight, though you can turn this off if you find it too obnoxious. For as great as Remastered\u2019s little tweaks and additions are, the true value proposition comes in when you start to talk about DLC. A slew of DLC that had to be purchased separately on PlayStation 3 comes bundled-in on PlayStation 4. For instance, Left Behind \u2013 The Last of Us\u2019 incredible single-player prequel DLC \u2013 is included (read the original review here ), as are a ton of online maps and modes that you\u2019d otherwise have to acquire separately on PS3. And yes, playing The Last of Us: Remastered online is just as awesome as it was the first time around, again aided by a silky-smooth framerate. I suspect the surprising online addiction The Last of Us provided in 2013 will be renewed for some and discovered for the first time for others."

Total War: Rome Remastered is a very faithful recreation of the series' first fully 3D expedition, originally known as Rome: Total War , with some modest but notable graphical and UI updates. But as astounding as it was at the time, the aging gameplay hasn\u2019t gotten the same attention, and doesn't hold up all that well compared to its successors as a result. The most obvious upgrades in Total War: Rome Remastered are visual. In fact, Creative Assembly insists that the engine running underneath is essentially unchanged, so everything from spies on the campaign map to a unit of Triarii on the fields of Italy should behave more or less just as it would if you fished your old CD-ROMs out of whatever box they're wedged in. And no doubt, it's an impressive face lift \u2013 especially when it comes to lighting and terrain details. The units, though, don't quite hold up to the level of fidelity we're used to in modern Total War or even 2013's Total War: Rome 2 , which is itself almost eight years old by now.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask And that's kind of a running theme with this remaster: they made an old game feel less old, but they certainly didn't make it feel new again. Rome: Total War was ahead of its time in so many ways when it came out, and all of those great ideas are still here. Dividing Rome itself up into three factions that are set off in three different directions to conquer, before ultimately meeting each other in a bloody civil war at the end, was a fantastically effective way to keep the late game challenging and interesting with fairly simple, transparent mechanics. There are even a couple things in here I think the original Rome did better than the games that came after it, like having to physically send a diplomat across the map to treat with other factions. It adds just a bit of extra immersion and sense of place if you can't ring Mithridates up on the phone to offer a trade deal. In most other ways, it's simply fallen too far behind the times.But in most other ways, it's simply fallen too far behind the times. Strategy games in general, and Total War specifically, have evolved so much in the last 18 years that going back to the original Rome can be deflating. The AI is one of the primary culprits. If you're coming from Total War: Three Kingdoms or Total War: Warhammer 2 , the various Gauls, Greeks, and Carthaginians you'll match wits against here won't feel like much of a match at all. It's relatively easy to beat entire armies just by microing your cavalry well, for example. The enemy tends to play very passive and can easily be lured into Cannae-like traps over and over again. It felt like going back in time as an adult to beat up on my middle school bully. Every IGN Total War Review Ever 20 Images The included Barbarian Invasion expansion was incredible in its day, but within the first handful of turns revisiting it, I was struck by the fact that it's basically a more primitive version of the excellent Total War: Attila , and I'd really rather be playing that. The fact that the map is smaller and there are fewer factions isn't necessarily the issue. In some ways, Total War actually works better with this reduced scope. But it's missing so many years of iteration and refinement of the formula that I wondered if it wouldn't have been worth including some more substantial, gameplay-related quality of life changes. A less obtuse public order system or a way to see at a glance how many men a unit needs to be back to full strength would have been nice. The UI is definitely much improved, especially in terms of readability.The UI is definitely much improved, especially in terms of readability. That's usually the part of older strategy games that drives me up a wall the fastest, since modern games have gotten so much better at it. But Rome: Remastered still doesn't offer up information as easily as its descendants. It's cleaner, but it's still dated. Getting more detail on how a specific building or unit ability works might be a pain or just impossible. And it seems like Feral Interactive has gone out of their way to keep the look and feel of a 2004 UI when I would have rather they shined and polished it up a bit more. What's the best Total War game ever? Rome: Total War Medieval 2: Total War Total War: Shogun 2 Total War: Warhammer 2 Total War: Three Kingdoms Other: Tell us in the comments Answer See Results There are a couple places where Rome: Remastered has added totally new features, and they're kinda neat. For one, there's a new \"experimental\" unit size that allows for even larger battles, in terms of the total number of troops, than even modern Total War games have without mods. This made the trade-off for lower resolution fighty guys seem more acceptable, as I was able to orchestrate some truly titanic, ancient clashes. You can also play as any faction right from the jump, whereas the original required you to beat each one while playing as Rome to unlock them \u2013 unless you want to do it the old-fashioned way. Oh, and the music? It still totally slaps. Barbarian Victory is still one of my favorite tracks from any strategy game. The whole soundtrack is energetic, distinct, and evocative. Optional Upgrade Though it wasn't made available for this review, Total War: Rome Remastered offers a free, Enhanced Graphics Pack that includes greatly enhanced textures \u2013 and it does go a long way toward bringing the look of the units up to a level of quality more like what you'd expect in a modern Total War game. Weapons and armor, especially, look much shinier and more realistic. Faces don't look nearly as flat and dead, though the overall quality level is still below Rome 2 or Shogun 2. It also adds about 20 GB to the install and impacted my performance on the Extreme unit size to the point that I was no longer able to cruise at 60+fps on my GeForce RTX 2060 Super with no major dips, like I was without the pack installed."

        "Content": "Standing on the edge of Midgar's expressway at the end of Final Fantasy VII Remake, the seemingly infinite possibilities of what could come next left me overwhelmed with a yearning I hadn't really felt from a game before \u2013 there was a whole world full of iconic moments awaiting modern revisions ahead, as well as whatever twists this now clearly diverging path might bring to them. In several ways, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is my wildest imagination made manifest, simultaneously another stunning reconstruction of my childhood memories and an interesting (if sometimes a little messy) new interpretation of a story I've cherished since 1997. Remake\u2019s already impeccable blend of action and turn-based RPG combat has been made fresh again with new mechanics and party members, and revamping the way the original overworld worked by splitting it into sprawling open regions full of enjoyable optional activities enriches places I thought I knew so well. There's a magic to doing all this with characters I love so much too, as their personal stories and pivotal moments have a new grandeur to them. However, Rebirth\u2019s sweeping ambition to create a new timeline for Final Fantasy VII bounces between being absolutely sublime and too convoluted for its own good. That\u2019s left me conflicted about parts of the execution of that new direction \u2013 but after spending more than 80 hours to finish the main story and a decent chunk of side content, there's no denying that Rebirth is an amazing journey despite that, and one I'll remember fondly as I eagerly anticipate the third act of this rebuilt Final Fantasy VII. What We Said About Final Fantasy VII Remake The expectations around Final Fantasy VII Remake are sky high, and it mostly manages to deliver. Its combat is top notch, its enemy variety kept me constantly entertained, and seeing this snippet of story fleshed out with real emotional arcs and the previously hidden humanity behind Midgar filled me with pure joy. The boring RPG filler and Kingdom Hearts-esque convolution that was inserted in between did stop my ear-to-ear grin from being constant, but never long enough to kill the mood completely. That leaves this remake as one that still delivered on letting me relive (part of) a classic in stupendous fashion, while also standing as a great RPG all its own. - Tom Marks, April 6, 2020 Score: 8 Read our full Final Fantasy VII Remake review . A major part of what makes that journey special is its impressive scale. As soon as I set foot onto the Grasslands, the first of six regions that make up Rebirth, a sense of awe washed over me. Looking out over the far-reaching horizon or seeing a backdrop of vast and distant mountain ranges, I was stunned by how gorgeously the previously low-poly world of Final Fantasy VII had been reimagined. An early cutscene shows Aerith taking in the beauty of a natural world she was never able to see before, only to have Red XIII remind her that it's still dying from the inside out. In doing so, the story reinforces the ongoing theme of environmental preservation from the outset, and instills that this is a planet worth fighting for. That's a feeling that consistently surfaced as I went from region to region, connecting with the people of each one and helping with their struggles through both the main story and a huge amount of sidequests. Rebirth manages to transcend its well-worn open world design. \u201c However, that wonder also came with some intimidation as I pulled up the world map, realizing how massive Rebirth was going to be \u2013 and that it has embraced many modern open-world design conventions. The nerdy researcher boy Chadley returns in a big way, acting as your liaison for most of the optional activities under the guise of furthering his scientific research, which includes activating towers spread throughout each region to mark tasks on your map. As familiar as that task is, Rebirth manages to transcend the negative connotations of this well-worn trope \u2013 the more I began to peel back the layers of all the activities that fill these zones, the more engrossed I got in clearing every icon I could from the map. That context made it more than just a checklist of chores. What's the Best Final Fantasy Game Ever?

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There's also something powerful in simply exploring each corner of these regions just to see how they've clung onto life in spite of the destructive effect of the relentless reliance on Mako energy. Scaling a cliff in Junon on my way to a side objective comes with the treat of a breathtaking but tainted view, such as the sunset splashing the desolate region with a cozy orange tint while the city's massive cannon looms in the background. You can see the contrast of Costa Del Sol's vibrant beachside next to the barren wasteland of Corel \u2013 a consequence of the iconic Gold Saucer's energy demand. Exploration in Rebirth evokes a similar feeling to one I had with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, where the sheer scope and spectacle of their respective worlds drew me into uncovering all they had to offer. Wondrous sights like these are their own little rewards. Finding wondrous sights are their own little rewards. \u201c Later areas in Rebirth change up how you move around them with unique abilities for your rideable chocobo. Bouncing off launchpad mushrooms to get around Gongaga's labyrinthine jungle and chaining boost pads to stay airborne in Cosmo Canyon started out cute, but eventually became more tedious than necessary. Rebirth also loves to make you climb cliffsides or swing across gaps with a grappling hook, Uncharted-style, which don't feel as fluid as they ought to be, though the sense of adventure these actions provide at least makes them tolerable. Whether you\u2019re tracking down Lifesprings to learn more about the region, fighting uniquely tough enemies in the wild while fulfilling specific battle conditions, or chasing down Protorelics for bespoke side stories, everything you do feeds into one gameplay system or another. For example, Lifesprings can unveil Divine Intel locations which can make the battles to unlock new Summons easier, or they can reveal the objective of an ongoing sidequest that didn't seem connected at first blush. Not all of the optional tasks are terribly exciting (like digging up treasure with your chocobo or doing silly timing-based inputs to activate Summon shrines) but the rewards are a decent enough incentive to at least prevent them from feeling like outright filler. Who are you definitely keeping in your party at all times? Tifa Barret Aerith Red XIII Yuffie Cait Sith Answer See Results Sidequests pop up at every major town's Community Noticeboard, and they paint a more complete picture of Rebirth's vision for its reimagined open world. A certain party member is typically tied to each individual sidequest, so you'll get to see a side of them you wouldn't be able to otherwise, and also increase their Bond level in the process (a new feature that\u2019s mainly relevant in a later part of the story I won\u2019t get into here). These are more than mere fetch quests, instead featuring multiple objectives that take you across regions and encourage exploration, and they often tell their own compelling little stories or uplift the human element of Final Fantasy VII. Some of the later sidequests even provide context that's almost essential in order to fully understand the world and a few supporting characters as well. Regardless of which tasks you take on, you'll be rewarded with XP for your Party Level, a separate progression system that advances your access to Folios. You can think of Folios as a system like Final Fantasy X \u2019s Sphere Grid, where you spend a pool of skill points to unlock new perks and abilities for each character. The biggest addition within Folios are Synergy Abilities, powerful partner attacks between specific characters that lay on heavy damage and can grant bonuses like extending stagger windows, filling the Limit Break bar, or temporarily negating all MP costs. You'll also access Synergy Skills that can be used on the fly to make combat more flexible, such as having Cloud launch Tifa into the air to get into melee range of flying enemies, or letting Barret soak up incoming damage for Aerith. Synergies are yet another tool in a bag full of tricks that complements the already intricate combat from Remake \u2013 and instead of bloating what's already quite a busy system, they work to fill gaps and reward you for expending ATB bars, making the combat loop feel more complete. Strong enemies won't go down through simple button mashing. \u201c The returning Pressure and Stagger systems once again push you toward understanding combat on a deeper level, since bosses and strong enemies won't go down through simple button mashing. Like in Remake, using the Assess ability reveals how you can exploit enemy vulnerabilities outside of their elemental weaknesses (if they even have any). That makes both the tactical foresight to line up an offensive push at just the right time and the skill necessary to execute it imperative. When it all comes together and you're firing off Limit Breaks, chunky weapon skills, and cinematic Synergy Abilities against a staggered formidable foe, it's undeniably satisfying \u2013 not just because of the weight behind each hit, but also in the gratification of having orchestrated it all under the pressure of aggressive and sometimes unforgiving enemies. As was the case in Remake, each character has a distinct fighting style, with Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and Aerith functioning just as they did before. But with new enemies and additional mechanics layered on, Rebirth pushes you to bring out the best in your party members. Yuffie plays like she did in Remake\u2019s Intergrade DLC and can be an absolute menace by covering all elements with Ninjutsu, cloning herself to multiply the impact of every action, and having the best mobility of anyone in the party. Now with a full party around her and a full game to build on her skillset, she stands out as the most dynamic of the bunch. The finally playable Red XIII brings something different to the table by turning defense into offense with his Vengeance stance, yet it's his fast combos and absolutely destructive Stardust Ray that make short work of enemies. No matter your party composition, switching between them on the fly while setting the others up to play their parts offers a constant variety in both the moment-to-moment action and the satisfaction of playing the field general. The depth of how all of these combat systems interconnect can be overwhelming, but it\u2019s incredibly rewarding when you start to unravel their intricacies and put them together in battle. Much of that comes from the returning Materia system, which lets you customize each party member's build to fill certain roles with magic spells, stat boosts, and passive skills. While it's largely the same as before, it's no worse for wear because of just how smart it is, providing a level of flexibility that has a dramatic effect on how everyone functions. Along with Synergies unlocked in Folios, the multitude of weapon skills earned throughout the journey, and powerful Summons that can turn the tide of any fight, Rebirth's combat offers an embarrassment of riches without making you too overpowered when it really counts. Important encounters can get extremely challenging even with all the tools you have \u2013 bosses push you to really work for your victory with how much they throw at you, and that level of effort is crucial for making combat so satisfying. You're expected to juggle their onslaught while trying to build ATB and exploit their specific vulnerabilities. However, at times, it did feel as though the way some of these tougher enemies were designed betrayed the principles of the combat system itself, as if there's a dissonance between how your party functions and what the enemy is capable of doing. Certain foes zip around the battlefield at high speeds that even the lock-on system has trouble tracking in a way that doesn\u2019t feel intentional, and getting constantly knocked back or caught in multi-hit combos is an occasional annoyance. It's obnoxious at best and actively frustrating at worst when an attack like this interrupts a spell and your ATB bar has already been burned, adding insult to injury. Thankfully, these exasperating moments don't overshadow the heights Rebirth reaches \u2013 with enough practice, preparation, and wits, even the hardest battles are a surmountable thrill to conquer. The Heart of the Cards Queen's Blood is the new card game introduced in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and it's an outstanding addition that had me sinking hours into defeating some of the toughest card-slinging opponents throughout the world. What starts as a grid-based game of territory control evolves into a cutthroat tactical exercise where you\u2019ll need to manage power level multipliers, attack cards, and unique conditions to buff your cards or debuff your opponent. Not only is it genius in its rules and varied card functions, but there's an entire side story that builds up as you progress in the main game. It explores the origins of Queen's Blood itself and goes in some wild and unpredictable directions on top of being a ton of fun to play. While the larger story Rebirth tells is a heart wrenching and compelling one, it does take a while for it to initially come into focus. After opening with the hard-hitting flashback of the tragedy at Cloud and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, you'll spend a lot of time getting acquainted with the flow of the open regions as you follow a chain of events that\u2019s familiar from the 1997 original. But by frontloading a lot of those diversions, it can lose the thread of what Cloud and the gang were even supposed to be doing in the first place. From Junon to Costa del Sol, you'll be spending more time in minigames than anything else, and that's all before getting to the Gold Saucer, which is the capital of minigames. Don't get me wrong, many of these activities are a joy in their own right, and a few of them make for memorable moments of levity. But a little bit of restraint could have helped keep the focus on the parts I cared about most. It seems like nitpicking, but that\u2019s especially true with things such as slow-paced crate-moving puzzles, stealth sections to unlock a region's chocobo, or the box-throwing microgames with Cait Sith in later chapters. That all said, these are ultimately minor inconveniences in what is largely a fantastic revision of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s story. If anything, the more robust minigames capture just how absolutely goofy the PS1 classic always was, livening up the adventure while still staying true to its identity. Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review 94 Images Rebirth manages to strike that delicate balance well, which is impressive given there was always a darkness and sorrow that permeated Final Fantasy VII, with the planet's very existence at risk, Shinra's destructive nature, and Sephiroth's calamitous ambitions looming. Cloud himself is a broken man, an unreliable narrator, and a complicated protagonist \u2013 and in the highest fidelity of modern tech, his slight but telling mannerisms speak as loud as anything he said in the original script. Nearly every party member has their moment to shine in this arc of Final Fantasy VII, and through impeccable cinematic stylings and top-tier voice performances, the cast's teetering between hope and despair is on full display. Barret's backstory was already unforgettable, but between the raw, emotional performance of voice actor John Eric Bentley and the graphical prowess of today's hardware, there's a newfound authenticity to the struggles he faces and painful resolutions that await him. Those modern qualities, along with a reimagined script, also give additional depth to Red XIII to round him out as a more complete character. Nearly every party member has a moment to shine. \u201c All the while, Aerith becomes an emotional leader and the relationship between her and Tifa grows stronger and more believable as they confide in each other and bear the brunt of Cloud's baggage. Rebirth is often cheesy in its writing and revels in its melodrama, but that's part of its charm. Within the cloying displays of friendship and theatrical pleas to protect the environment are undeniably genuine messages about how we carry ourselves in our own lives. That tone is what lets this particular brand of storytelling strike a chord as effectively as it does, elevating Rebirth above many of its contemporaries. Performance Review Summary Final Fantasy VII is a classic and Rebirth delivers on providing an incredible next chapter of the remake trilogy. This is a performance review though and on performance the team has delivered a near rock solid game that caters to both 30 and 60fps players. On a visual front though, it suffers from similar, and due to scale, more issues than Remake. This leaves a mixed impression, and though I hate to say it, it can look closer to a cross-generation game in some of the worst-case scenarios with regard to material details and quality. FF7 Rebirth \u2013 Performance Comparison Screenshots 18 Images The patch offers a small but noticeable increase to this, but more is required to aid the assets, and I feel this is beyond a simple patch. Asset quality and details can be muddy, even in the 4K mode, and even if other increases come in the form of improved Mip bias, adjusted TAA, or improved screen space shadow sampling, it would not resolve the lion's share of the issues. That could only be improved with updated and higher quality assets and materials in the affected areas. Polygon count and textures would be the biggest focus for a later patch, which could transform the game's look in those weaker areas. The team may be able to improve the game further, but at least you can play without any concerns on the performance side, and 30fps may have never looked so good. \u2013 Michael Thompson Read the full Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Performance Review The concept of rebuilding Final Fantasy VII\u2019s story for a new generation came with the theme of defying your supposed fate, which was made explicit toward the end of Remake with the convergence of alternate timelines affecting each other. It took me a while to come around on this idea, and although the mechanisms that turn the wheels of fate in Rebirth are as obtuse as they've ever been, it's a direction I've wanted to embrace. But while this new-ish story has the potential to be equally as powerful as the original, it pains me to say that Rebirth fumbles the execution. Avoiding any spoilers, the events of its conclusion and the ensuing aftermath are portrayed in a way that is both convoluted and undefined, robbing it of its impact. It's a case of trying to do too much without the connective tissue to bring it all together. Cryptic messages and nuanced meanings can be well and good, but sometimes stories also have to speak plainly about what is actually happening, and Rebirth does not when it needs to most. Michael Higham's Personal Final Fantasy Rankings To be clear, I do like every entry listed in here. See All 1 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Shadowbringers Square Enix 2 Final Fantasy VI Square 3 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Endwalker Square Enix 4 Final Fantasy VII Square 5 Final Fantasy Tactics Square 6 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Heavensward Square Enix 7 Final Fantasy VII Remake Square Enix 8 Final Fantasy XIV Online: Stormblood Square Enix 9 Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Square Enix 10 Final Fantasy IV Square Even with the baffling delivery of its conclusion, some of the new scenes surrounding that finale do offer sobering messages about grief, letting go, and the acceptance of life's inevitable end \u2013 and sometimes that also means finding something worth fighting for. These quiet moments encourage a different kind of reflection that the original wasn't able to touch on. How we make sense of our lives and our place in a world full of tragedy is a complicated and messy endeavor that seems full of contradictions, and Rebirth makes that fittingly clear. So even though the new path these remakes are trying to forge is both fascinating and flawed, Final Fantasy VII\u2019s story still manages to hold a poignant mirror up to our own world, 27 years later.

        "Content": "Editor's Note: We've replaced the video version of this review with one that uses gameplay footage recorded on the PC build of Cyberpunk 2077, instead of the trailers we had to use previously due to CD Projekt Red's pre-release restrictions. The content of the review itself is identical, but the gameplay now more closely represents the experience we had while playing. Editor's Note 2:Due to the dramatic difference in performance, we've given a separate review score to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Cyberpunk 2077 . We do not recommend it on those platforms at this time. In my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn\u2019t without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves \u2013 optional or not \u2013 and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I\u2019ve played in recent years. You\u2019re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass \u2013 even if, to be blunt, Reeves\u2019 stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny\u2019s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Patches Since Launch Updated 2/4/21 Since publishing this review, CD Projekt Red has released multiple patches attempting to improve the performance of Cyberpunk 2077 and fix bugs. Multiple smaller updates were released closer to release, including the 1.06 patch we took a deep look at hare , with the larger 1.1 patch arriving more recently . Additionally, CDPR stated that next-gen versions are aimed for release in the second half of 2021. It\u2019s worth noting that the 1.1 update inadvertently introduced a different game breaking bug that quickly needed to be patched out as well, so while improvements are certainly being made issues haven\u2019t gone entirely gone away. You can find a full 1.1 performance analysis here for an in-depth look at how these patches have changed the state of Cyberpunk 2077 at the time of this update. Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s slow burn of an intro \u2013 it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time \u2013 I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V\u2019s struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City ; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no one\u2019s going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble \u2013 and from the early hours you\u2019ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time. The structure here feels very different from many RPGs I\u2019ve played, including CD Projekt Red\u2019s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you don\u2019t have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often don\u2019t even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there\u2019s so much to see and do \u2013 and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out \u2013 that I didn\u2019t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice. The intro did an incredible job of getting me invested in V and Johnny\u2019s struggle. \u201c And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won\u2019t get that \u201cwow\u201d feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it \u2013 for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered there\u2019s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. You\u2019ll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer \u2013 from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them \u2013 is frequently rewarding on its own. Cyberpunk 2077 PC Gameplay Screenshots 42 Images In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means you\u2019ll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There\u2019s some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you\u2019re constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I won\u2019t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions. Divergent Paths Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly you\u2019ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don\u2019t let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. It\u2019s frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make \u2013 choice in dialogue options, how to build your character , how to approach missions, and beyond. I\u2019d frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if I\u2019d done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both V\u2019s own story and those of the characters around them. At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone else\u2019s game where they\u2019d picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn\u2019t even offered to another player because of a single decision we\u2019d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I\u2019d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation. Don\u2019t let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and through. \u201c The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark . I don\u2019t want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like \u201cMILFguard\u201d (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher\u2019s Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in. The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPR\u2019s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one) \u2013 and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you\u2019ll get in the end. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a Rorschach Test. \u201c This is the crux of what\u2019s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It\u2019s not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: it\u2019s a Rorschach Test. It\u2019s shorter than the epic-length quest you might\u2019ve expected, but with an amount of variation that\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what you\u2019re going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player. That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it\u2019s organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny\u2019s story than others. It\u2019s primarily broken into \u201c Main Jobs \u201d that are required to progress, \u201cGigs\u201d that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a \u201c Side Jobs \u201d category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What\u2019s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings. Does hearing Cyberpunk 2077 can be \"beaten\" in about 20 hours make you more or less interested in playing? More Less No change Answer See Results Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of V\u2019s journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that. Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times \u2013 like you\u2019re playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V\u2019s journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of V\u2019s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural. Blade Gunner While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn\u2019t any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes , and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if you\u2019re planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (I\u2019m not sure why, but let\u2019s just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown. Every CD Projekt Red Review 13 Images What\u2019s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you can\u2019t bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you don\u2019t invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use \u2013 so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize you\u2019re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you\u2019ve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have. Combat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete control over the choreography. \u201c Combat itself is another aspect where you\u2019ll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn\u2019t in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting. What's the Deal With PS5 and Series X Versions? I've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year. I wouldn\u2019t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It\u2019s not the most complex dance in the world, but it\u2019s one I felt I had complete control over choreographing. I also love Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot \u2013 things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or\u2026 a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff . The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in V\u2019s apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use \u2013 though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons I\u2019ve found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap. The soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially stands out. \u201c Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn\u2019t much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way. What's more important to an open-world RPG? A great main quest Great side quests Answer See Results Quickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my V\u2019s high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out. When things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone. Bugs in the System Unfortunately, the amount of bugs I\u2019ve experienced really does need to be mentioned. I\u2019ve only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues I\u2019ve encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as you\u2019d hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions \u2013 but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me. I\u2019ve had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. I\u2019d frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. I\u2019ve had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful. Cyberpunk 2077 - Examples of Visual Bugs 9 Images A day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance \u2013 which is always good, but frankly those aren\u2019t the issues that\u2019ve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today. Just to restate, a word of warning: we haven\u2019t been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all \u2013 not on the new-gen systems or the old. While I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues I\u2019ve seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what it\u2019ll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If that\u2019s where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision.

        "Content": "Update: Dishonored 2 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year .   No two playthroughs are the same in Dishonored 2. Developer Arkane has doubled down on the original\u2019s play-your-way formula with two separate sets of skills, a deep and multifaceted world, and a dizzying array of level designs that affect your approach to each new area. Whether you choose a stealthy or bloody approach, each one of your playthroughs is an addition to the wide range of stories that can be told within this wonderfully twisted universe.  15 years have gone by since the events of the original Dishonored, and the world of Empress of the Isles, Emily Kaldwin, is once again thrown into disarray when her evil aunt appears with suspicious designs on her throne. It\u2019s a pedestrian catalyst to your most vital decision in Dishonored 2: will you play as Emily or her father and protector (and original Dishonored protagonist), Corvo Attano? Though their stories play out in much the same way, with well-crafted and low-key dialogue tailored to your character, it\u2019s worth taking time to consider your choice, as it\u2019s one you are stuck with for the rest of your 12 to 16-hour playthrough, depending on whether you choose high-chaos (quicker) or low (slower).  Splitting abilities and story details up between Emily and Corvo is a smart call on Arkane\u2019s part, as the developer has put a lot of focus on each character\u2019s individual skills, which can only be built up through time and a careful and considered search for upgrade-granting collectibles. Both Emily and Corvo work excellently in either a stealth style or violent playthrough, despite their different supernatural abilities.  Their basics are much the same, though. For those who want to play with a focus on combat, a wide range of ammo is available for your pistol and crossbow, and mines can be used to either stun or dismember your enemies. Should you prefer to play stealthily, each character has the handy ability to choke out enemies during combat if you parry them just right, and knock out enemies by dropping on them from above for a quiet takedown. In terms of supernatural abilities, Emily\u2019s Far Reach works in much the same way as Corvo\u2019s short-range Blink teleport, and both characters can be equipped with Dark Vision, allowing them to see enemies through walls to aid in stealth. Where they differ is in the more advanced unlockable powers in the later stages that ramps up the fun. Take Emily\u2019s Domino ability, for example: it links enemies together so they share the same fate. You can use this power to take down several enemies at once with a single sleeping dart while hidden in the rafters, or blast one enemy with your pistol and joyfully watch the blood spurt from a multitude of skulls. If you\u2019re playing as Corvo your options are just as much of a good time: his Bend Time ability can stop time altogether in its later stages, allowing for magnificent slow-mo kills or a magical escape after assassinating someone the old-fashioned way. All of their abilities can be combined in various ways, too, and playful experimentation makes for Dishonored 2\u2019s most hilarious water-cooler moments. With careful timing and preparation, you can send one of Emily\u2019s Doppelgangers into a fray, link her with several guards using Domino, then watch them attack her and unwittingly cut themselves to pieces. Or you could stop time with Corvo while fighting some enemies in an alleyway and possess a nearby rat, leaving them confused about where their prey has gone. In its best moments Dishonored 2 makes you feel like you can control any situation in any number of creative ways. Keeping Things Interesting  You can\u2019t lean too heavily on one approach in Dishonored 2 though, because Arkane keeps switching up central gameplay mechanics in each chapter, and that makes each one feel vital and distinct. In the Dust District, for example, billows of dust will obscure your vision every five minutes or so - but also the guards\u2019, giving you opportunities to slip by that don\u2019t exist on any other map. In the Clockwork Mansion, the layout of each floor can be changed using levers, allowing for quick getaways or access to secret areas. In The Royal Conservatory, you must deal with enemies who can teleport in the same way you do. Those changes all have to be incorporated into your approach to any given situation. Such unpredictable additions to an already complex world kept me constantly alert and thinking as I pursued my targets. And because mortality is ultimately a binary choice in Dishonored - kill fewer NPCs and you\u2019ll be granted a \u2018happier\u2019 ending; kill more and you\u2019ll progress more easily - this focus is very important.  The World and Those Who Dwell In it Meanwhile, Dishonored 2\u2019s world is busy doing a great job of accommodating any brand of chaos you can throw at it. The Southern-European-kissed city of Karnaca is not only beautiful, filled with lush greenery and hugged-by-a-whale-boat peppered harbour, but it\u2019s as dense with secrets as Dishonored\u2019s Dunwall, with layers of guard-infested main paths, twisting alleyways, hidden entrances, and tall, bloodfly-infested buildings. While I did notice some pop-in issues on the PlayStation 4 (which I\u2019ve exclusively played on for this review) in open areas - and one crash - they were no deal-breakers, and overall the detail Arkane has managed to stuff into Dishonored 2 is astounding. The gorgeous, painterly aesthetic has been carried over from the original, and every piece of furniture, artwork and branded oddity feels considered and cohesive. Part of the joy of exploring Karnaca is to uncover Arkane\u2019s dense world building, from the eccentric advertisements to the newspapers expanding on the lore of the world - the suspects in a murder case, for example, or the technological advancements created by crazed industrialists that are shaking up the world.   The city feels alive. Unlike the streets of the original's Dunwall, where a rat plague was used as rationale behind their emptiness, Karnaca is thriving. NPCs beckon you over to give you an optional quest; a shopkeeper might unexpectedly ask you to hide from an approaching gang, or you\u2019ll overhear a couple of blood-splattered whalers discussing the repercussions of something you did a chapter or two ago. As far as I can tell after two playthroughs, this (and more appearances of the deadly bloodfly nests based on the number of people you\u2019ve killed) is about the extent of how your actions affect the world at large, minute-to-minute, but it\u2019s still a neat touch. The AI feels alive, too. Common enemies are incredibly receptive to the slightest movement, which means troubles for you if you attack one too loudly within a big group. It\u2019s fun to mess around with them because of their attentiveness and their reactions to en masse attacks - draw an enemy\u2019s attention over to a stun mine by throwing a bottle or making a noise, link him to his friends with Domino, and you can clear the area by exploiting human-like behavior on the first try. But perhaps the most fun you can have with Dishonored 2\u2019s AI is with its Clockwork Soldiers. They\u2019re tall, tough clockwork robots with knives for arms that can kill you with a single swipe, but they\u2019re receptive to movement, so if you blind one it will attack anything it senses... including other enemies. They, more than any other AI in Dishonored 2, are walking opportunities.  The liveliness in Dishonored 2\u2019s world encourages a constant drive to explore, which is both rewarding due to the way interesting things are spread around the maps and also helpful during main quests. You are an assassin, but there are always at least two ways to dispense of your final mark in Dishonored 2 - and one of those can only be unlocked through careful examination of clues and evidence scattered around the area. During my second playthrough, I discovered vital information I\u2019d breezed past in my first by paying particular attention to an important letter I\u2019d ignored the first time around, and I imagine there\u2019ll still be more to uncover in my third.    Emily, Corvo and Co  Dishonored\u2019s broader story  is ultimately predictable if you\u2019re familiar with the first game (which you should be, because it\u2019s excellent). It\u2019s a particular shame that Dishonored 2\u2019s intriguing villains aren\u2019t given the character-building scenes they deserve - their primary drive appears to be \u2018evil for the sake of evil\u2019 - and finding diaries and audio logs that explain their motivations isn\u2019t sufficient, nor is it quite the same as a story presented as cinematics with dialogue. What does work, however, are Dishonored 2\u2019s protagonists and its secondary players. The voicework of Corvo and Emily is delightfully understated - Erica Luttrell does a fine job at balancing subtlety, vulnerability, and disgust, while Stephen Russell (best known as Garrett in the Thief series) is warmly familiar as Dishonored 2\u2019s (cut-throat) father figure.  But curiously, the biggest character arc given not to its protagonists, but to Meagan Foster (voiced by Rosario Dawson). She\u2019s captain of the Dreadful Wale, the ship that serves as your base in between missions. A tough, driven woman with a mysterious past, Meagan\u2019s story unfolds slowly and delicately throughout Dishonored 2, delivered with empathy by Dawson.  PC Version Impressions by Leana Hafer The PC version of Dishonored 2 has had a rocky launch, with many gamers reporting major performance issues and giving it a \u201cMixed\u201d rating on the Steam store page. Arkane has acknowledged the issues and promised an update to resolve them \u201cin the coming days.\u201d That said, I haven\u2019t been able to replicate those problems. My experience with Dishonored 2 wasn\u2019t flawless, but I seem to have dodged the worst of it. Running a Core i7 4770K with a GeForce GTX 1070 and 16GB RAM on Arkane\u2019s \u201cAuto\u201d settings (a mix of Very High and Ultra), I was initially faced with unstable frame rates: I would cruise along at 60fps for a good part of a level before experiencing random drops into the 40s. It never became unplayable, but it was certainly noticeable, and that\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t happen on a system that exceeds the recommended spec (which lists a GTX 1060). A fresh restart and closing down background processes like a video streaming on my second screen allowed me to play without significant variance in the frame rate for a good few hours, even in instances of high action.  Then I tried to replicate some of the more egregious reports I\u2019d heard about PC performance. After reading through Bethesda\u2019s performance FAQ, I experimented with setting everything on Ultra, on which, somewhat to my surprise, I was still able to maintain 60fps in virtually all situations. The one setting that did seem to have a negative impact, oddly enough, was turning off Vsync. While disabling Vsync will normally uncap your frame rate and allow your game to run as fast as it can at a given moment, in this case disabling the setting seems to introduce inexplicable jitter to the frame rate in complex scenes. Though, again, the dips were never to the point of making it unplayable - I never saw my frame rate counter drop below 30 in any of my stress tests.  Alt + Tabbing out and back in (another possible culprit nominated by Bethesda) seemed like it might cause a gradual, progressive increase in instances of jittery frame rate, but I didn\u2019t test this extensively enough to say for sure how much of an impact it had. Restarting the game almost always granted me a smooth 60 fps for a good while in cases where I suspected this was happening. In general, the game was very well-behaved with Alt + Tab in the short term. I wasn\u2019t able to pinpoint exactly what may have been causing issues for those with similar - or even better - hardware, but the recommendations I can give include keeping Vsync on, closing background processes, and restarting the game if framerate seems to become unstable after Alt +Tabbing out and back in. I ran into no instances of sub-60 framerate that were not solved by those steps. The world looks fantastic on Ultra and Very High settings. Textures are far from breathtaking, especially if you\u2019re used to playing with modded Ultra HD textures in other games, but they\u2019re well above the standard of other multi-platform games I\u2019ve seen this year. The lighting and post-processing is first-class, lending a delicious sense of atmosphere and depth to every location I skulked my way through. Even the distant backdrops that never become part of the playable space, like the soaring sea cliffs of Serkonos, are rendered with volumetric fog and lighting in such a way that they feel eerily real. The menus are more than tolerable. My mouse cursor seemed to have some level of sluggishness and acceleration when navigating them, but there were no responsiveness issues actually clicking on options - a problem that still exists in Skyrim Special Edition, five years after the issue reared its head in the original game. The options available are also fairly respectable. Field of view is adjustable between 65 and 110 degrees (I found that my sweet spot is somewhere around 95). The mouse and keyboard controls are overall very responsive and friendly. It's possible to adjust X and Y axis stick sensitivity individually if you\u2019re playing with a controller, and mouse options allow you fine control over sensitivity and smoothing. You can also fine-tune the level of auto-aim or turn it off entirely, independently for mouse and controller. Finally, there\u2019s an option called \u201cAdaptive Resolution\u201d that is supposed to be able to dynamically adjust resolution if your framerate starts to drop, but I found that it had no significant impact on my machine. So this is a tricky one: for some people Dishonored is unplayable right now \u2013 I've seen streamers with beefier machines than mine struggle to maintain 20fps on relatively low settings \u2013 but we\u2019ve had minimal issues. Thus our high recommendation comes with a caveat: to be safe, you should probably wait for the patch before you buy. If it runs poorly for you, and you opt for a wait and see approach instead of getting your money back now,  don't play more than the two hours you're allowed to remain eligible for a Steam refund."

        "Content": "Microsoft Flight Simulator is the most incredible experience I've ever had on a computer. The realism, the depth, the almost limitless replayability \u2013 it's like nothing I've ever played before. It does so much to recreate the feeling of actual flight, at a level of accuracy never before seen, that there were times when I came in for a landing at real-life airfields I'd seen during my time in the Air Force where I was simply stunned. These are places I will likely never visit again as a civilian, and yet as I gazed out the window during my final descent into places like Jacobabad, Pakistan or Thumrait, Oman, I was seeing an approximation so close to what I remembered from all those years ago that I actually said out loud, \"Holy shit, I remember this.\" The attention to detail in the plane interiors, rebuilt virtually using laser scans of the real things, manufacturing documents, and CAD drawings, is astonishingly precise. But it's the integration with Microsoft's real-world Bing map services that takes this incredible simulation into a whole new realm of freedom and realism. Granted, there are a few cracks in the picture-perfect facade in some of the more remote areas, and the buildings outside of major cities are built largely with a clever algorithm instead of by human hands, but it's still absolutely wild how complete it seems. If you want to fly over your house, it's there, in Flight Simulator, exactly where it ought to be. It might not look exactly like your house, but it's there. I promise. 32 of Microsoft Flight Simulator's 37,000 Airports 32 Images The base version of Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with 20 planes and 30 hand-crafted airports. That might not seem like a lot of locations, but the remaining 37,000+ of the world\u2019s airports are generated using technology sufficiently advanced that, to my eye, it is indistinguishable from magic. My local airport on the east coast of the United States, for example, is tiny and largely unremarkable, but I was impressed by how close to the mark Flight Simulator came while I was taxiing to park my Cessna. Every building is in the right place, aside from a few of the smaller (less than 10x10') outbuildings. It's quite impressive. Update: The Xbox Series X/S Version By Seth Macy, July 30, 2021 My favorite game of 2020 is now officially on Xbox Series X /S, and if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you can add it to your console as part of your subscription. What have you got to lose (other than about 100GB of space)? I've been playing Flight Simulator since its PC alpha days, and I was skeptical Asobo would be able to pull off a console version. I'm happy to say Microsoft Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X is almost everything I love about the PC version. In fact, I would venture to guess this is basically just the newly optimized PC update. Regardless, it's as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as it is on my PC, maybe even moreso, since I've gone from a 27\" 1440p PC monitor to a 55\" 4K TV on my Xbox. However, I don't think I'll be ditching my PC set-up just yet. While the Xbox version automatically carried over all my settings from my PC (including my tail number), my control settings are currently custom-configured for the Thrustmaster TCA Officer Pack control stick and throttle quadrant at full-sim settings. This control setup is currently unsupported by the Xbox, so I was forced to use my regular old controller. Of course, for 95% of people that won't be a problem, but for insufferable nerds seething with uncontrollable dad-energy like me, it's just not the same. But not all is lost: there are existing flight sticks, such as the Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS One , that are compatible, and even more Xbox Series X|S flight controllers are planned for future release. That being said, if you adjust the controls down to their most basic options you can jump into a plane and start exploring the world pretty quickly and easily, and that's what really matters in Microsoft Flight Simulator. The world is yours to explore, just like in the PC version, with sight-seeing highlights, animal tours, and the entirety of planet Earth streaming from Bing maps. Our in-depth Performance Review is currently in the works, but anecdotally I can say that on Series X it\u2019s pretty solid: I ran into a slight framerate hiccup on approach to the Naples' airport, but it was extremely brief and honestly nothing I hadn't experienced before on the PC version. Knowing of the heavy lift the PC version requires to run Flight Simulator at medium to high settings, it's really a testament to the architecture of the Xbox Series X and the optimizations by the team at Asobo that it runs so well on console. The hand-crafted airports, built from scans and real-world blueprints, are even more technically awe-inspiring \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen anything close to this level of accuracy in a flight simulation before. What I really like is how developer Asobo Studios expanded the selection of \"hand crafted\" recreations beyond just the major airports. Sure, major hubs like JFK, Seattle-Tacoma, and Heathrow are lovingly recreated in the base game, but smaller airports are also here. There's even one in South America that's no more than a strip of dirt cutting a swath through the thick rainforest. I wasn't expecting to find such accuracy for these tiny, more challenging destinations, but I loved discovering them. In a similar vein are the airplanes themselves \u2013 the level of detail is astounding. I can say from real-world experience the cockpit of the Cessna 172 Skyhawk is perfect. You could snap a screenshot and share it online as a photo and, unless your PC is a complete potato, it would easily fool a lot of people. (I know this because I did exactly that .) Asobo not only flawlessly recreated the look of the interiors and exteriors of the available planes, but the instruments are also fully operational. The Garmin digital instruments appear and function exactly as they do in real life because the developers built emulators for the actual software that runs them into Flight Simulator. This is the first game I've ever played where I downloaded a .PDF manual from a real-world piece of equipment to reference during play \u2013 and everything in the manual checks out to the virtual hardware. It excites the absolute nerdiest parts of my core. Cruising Altitude As unbelievably realistic as the flight simulation is, it's also accessible to just about anyone's level of flight experience. You can turn on all the assists and enjoy Flight Simulator in a more arcade-style, or turn them all off and approach a virtual sortie in the same way you\u2019d do the real thing, checklists and all. As someone without a pilot\u2019s license (I was an electrician in the Air Force, not a pilot) my personal preference is playing halfway between the full simulation and the highest assist settings because it still creates a very challenging experience but removes some of the mundane steps from the process, like pre-flight checks, engine start, etc. Better still, since Flight Simulator is coming to Xbox Series X at some as-of-yet-undetermined point in the future, it controls really well with just an Xbox One controller. The elevator controls are a little touchy on some of the planes using the analog stick, but can be adjusted to suit your needs. Overall, I have no complaints about playing with the controller. It still requires keyboard functionality to get the most out of your plane, but there's no immediate need to rush out and buy a flight stick or yoke. Every Modern IGN 10/10 25 Images That being said, the simulation is much more authentic and enjoyable if you do have access to a dedicated flight controller. I used Thrustmaster's new Airbus A380 flight stick, in addition to my time with the Xbox controller, and it makes flying that much more immersive. Even planes with yokes are better with a flight stick, so if you have the means and if you can actually find one, I recommend picking up a dedicated controller for the full Flight Simulator experience. Just keep in mind it's not a requirement, which is a great feature for those of us who\u2019d rather dabble in flying than make a big hardware investment. The 20 planes and 30 hand-crafted airports in the $60 base version of Microsoft Flight Simulator are already a respectable amount of content. These aircraft run the gamut from highly maneuverable stunt planes like the Aviat Pitts Special S2S biplane, to wide-bodied airliners like the \"Queen of the Skies\" herself, the Boeing 747-8. However, if you\u2019re hungry for more, the $90 Deluxe Edition adds five more planes and five airports, and the $120 Premium Deluxe Edition adds another five of each, for a total of 30 different aircraft and 40 airports. The variety is excellent, although as an Air Force vet I was a little disappointed that there are no military aircraft. I was holding out hope I'd get to fly a C-130 (my favorite airplane of all), or a C-17. A military trainer like the jet-propelled T-38 would also have been an exciting addition, or even a ViperJet. If you want to fly a jet aircraft the only option right now is a passenger plane, and that's a bit of a bummer \u2013 but certainly not a deal breaker. I\u2019m not trying to knock the already impressive selection here, either, I'm just being greedy. With that said, I was perfectly content with the 20 planes included with the base game, and I don't really see the need to upgrade unless you feel you absolutely must get behind the controls of a 787-10 Dreamliner or a Cessna 152 or 172 variant. Aircraft run the gamut from highly maneuverable stunt planes like the Aviat Pitts Special S2S biplane to the Boeing 747-8. \u201c Even with medium assists turned on, getting off the ground and back again in one piece requires a lot of planning, careful maneuvering, and tons of practice. There is a built-in \"flight school\" that puts you in the pilot seat of the Cessna 172, and it\u2019s great. It helped me a lot with terminology, best flight practices, and getting used to handling the aircraft. By the time I finished all the flight lessons, I felt completely confident in my abilities controlling the Cessna and its maneuvers. The other planes operate under the same basic principles, but some of them, particularly the airliners like the A320neo and the 747, require a lot of familiarizing if you even want to attempt a landing without a disaster. I wish there was more aircraft-specific training available for the other planes in the fleet, but there is a pretty smart AI you can hand the controls to at any time during your flight. I was able to learn a lot about the proper approach angle and landing speeds just from watching my AI pilot take over. (I expect YouTube tutorials will become a thriving genre as well.) And besides, if just flying for the sake of flying is your goal, you can always turn on the assists to make it easier. Final Approach All of that gorgeous detail and accurately modeled equipment is on the inside, but the absolute genius of Microsoft Flight Simulator is actually outside the planes, enabled by its Bing Maps integration. Two petabytes (that\u2019s 2,000 terabytes) of satellite and high-altitude photography  are available to stream to your computer to accurately represent whatever part of the globe you decide to visit. The effect is absolutely mindblowing: I've flown places I've never been in my life, circling Machu Picchu or barnstorming between the Great Pyramids, and it feels like virtual sightseeing. But I've also flown to places I have visited just to relive the travel experience, and have been thoroughly impressed. More than once I've set off from my local airport and followed real-life roads through the Maine woods and into Quebec, retreading (re-winging?) the route I took last year by car. I've also landed on the tiny dirt airstrips in some of Maine's remote inhabited islands, taking in the familiar scenery from 2,500 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. You can even fly in real-world weather conditions with live air traffic, all of which is adjustable with in-game menus that are easily accessible during flight. If you've ever wanted to take off from an airport in a driving snowstorm at night, you can set the weather and time to your liking. One of my favorite things to do when flying is to adjust the time of day to the \"golden hour,\" early mornings or just before dusk when the sun's rays are at their warmest and most pleasant. It makes for some incredible sights. The limitations of the Bing integration come in two distinct circumstances: if your internet service provider has a data cap, and when the existing aerial photography of an area happens to be low-resolution. In the case of the data cap problem, you can preinstall locations ahead of time, so you load one small chunk of data rather than opening up the data firehose. Asobo seems to be sympathetic to this hazard and offers a setting in the menus to track your data use and set an upper limit so you don't go over your cap. After a few hours of play, including flights over San Francisco and New York City, I only used a few megabytes of data, but multiply that over a few hours a day over the course of a month (and flying over less frequently traveled areas) and it could become concerning. (Also, that comes after you install this 150GB monster of a game!) If you've ever wanted to take off from an airport in a driving snowstorm at night, you can set the weather and time to your liking. \u201c The second limitation is with low-resolution maps, which show up in some of the more remote corners of the Earth, but it\u2019s only really noticeable at low-altitudes. Personally, I find the thrill of flying a few feet above the Colorado river more than enough to compensate for the lack of texture details on the walls of the Grand Canyon. Also, since the data is pulled directly from Bing, low-resolution areas will improve as its database of imagery improves over time. At the moment, though, some places do look decidedly\u2026 PlayStation 1\u2026 when you're up close and personal. Friendly Skies The act of flying and exploring some far-flung corner of the Earth is more than enough to keep me entertained, but Flight Simulator adds some competitive elements, including landing challenges. A rotating selection of remote and challenging airstrips become a place to showcase your landing skills, with scores being assigned to your performance in categories like accuracy on the runway, roll distance, and bounce. It's actually a really fun way to increase your skills, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to land successfully on a mountaintop airfield in France. Will I ever top the leaderboards on these challenges? Well, for now, yeah. I actually have a few of the world's top-scores for some of the landing challenges. Will this trend hold once the game comes out? No. God no. But will I continue trying to improve my scores? My inner competitor demands that I must! Naturally, many of those attempts will end with you damaging or even outright crashing your plane. You might think you're making a last-ditch effort to put your plane on the ground, only to discover (like I did) the landing gear on a heavy like the Airbus A320neo isn't designed for non-tarmac use. For obvious reasons, a crash doesn\u2019t result in a realistic fireball, but rather a black screen and a pop-up window that alerts you to your shameful performance \u2013 as if you didn\u2019t already know. It's not just crashes that cause instant failure: taking a plane well beyond its physical limitations, like an over-speed scenario, will also end your flight before you actually hit the ground. I found this out while first trying to do a barrel roll in a 747 and ended up descending too fast. That's not to say you can't do some sick stunts: you absolutely can make that 747 execute a successful barrel roll with a little practice \u2013 I did it a LOT, actually. It's just you can't make a plane do more than it could do in real life. You absolutely can make that 747 execute a successful barrel roll with a little practice. \u201c Performance wise, Flight Simulator looks great on my PC, which is no slouch but a few years old at this point. I'm running a Core i7-7700K with a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU and 32GB of RAM. Microsoft Flight Simulator set itself to \"high\" when I initially started up, but I did find myself turning down some of the lighting effects to medium to improve performance. That made it steady, for the most part, except that loading into one of the larger airports near a major city slowed things down to a crawl, particularly when I tried to fly one of the bigger airplanes. However, the stuttering frame rate always mellowed out to a nice, pleasant clip after a few seconds, making for a smooth flight. How Are You Primarily Planning to Play Microsoft Flight Simulator? To see the sights To simulate the experience of piloting To compete in the challenges Just mess around, no big deal Other Answer See Results Where my PC really struggles with Microsoft Flight Simulator, and I suspect this will be a problem for most people, is loading times. Big airports take a long time, sometimes as much four minutes in the case of Chicago O'Hare. Even remote airports with far less going on take at least a minute. I'm certain it's not my PC\u2019s fault, because I installed Microsoft Simulator on a 1TB WD Blue M.2 NVMe SSD, and it\u2019s hard to get a lot faster than that right now. It's not surprising given the staggering amount of data Microsoft Flight Simulator has to load, but it's still impossible to ignore all that time you spend twiddling your thumbs. As frustrating as the loading times can be, once you're into an area it only takes a few seconds to restart if you crash or manually reset your flight. Personally, I didn't mind the wait too much \u2013 it represents only a fraction of the total time I spent in the cockpit. It also should be pointed out that, at launch, Flight Simulator doesn\u2019t support VR, but Microsoft says it\u2019s coming in a patch later this year. Just the thought of being able to play Flight Simulator in virtual reality has me seriously considering upgrading to a new headset. As incredible as it looks and feels on just my monitor, I really want to immerse myself in the experience as much as humanly possible."

        "Content": "Note: With the launch of the PlayStation 5 Slim in December of 2023, we've published an updated version of our PlayStation 5 review to reflect the current hardware. Below is the original review that was published on November 6, 2020 and updated on November 6, 2021. After a generation of figuratively towering above its rivals with the monstrously successful PlayStation 4, one thing is certain: Sony\u2019s new-generation contender also looms large over its peers... literally. This thing is massive. However, what the PlayStation 5 lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in potential, thanks in part to its amazingly fast SSD but mostly to its truly remarkable new controller, the DualSense. While a good deal of what folks are going to be able to squeeze out of 2020\u2019s salvo of shiny new hardware may be bottlenecked to some degree by the screen that they own, the PS5\u2019s unique DualSense democratises a next-gen gaming experience for all, delivering an amazing new level of haptic feedback that really needs to be felt to be believed. Make no mistake: the austere and unceremonious nature of the box and packaging is in stark contrast to the PlayStation 5 itself , which is far and away the most flamboyant-looking console I\u2019ve ever owned. Rather than a single shell, the PS5 appears to be made up of four separate pieces: a glossy, black case sandwiched between a pair of warped, matte-white plastic plates, with a detachable stand. One-Year Update, November 11, 2021: Over the past year the stand has proven it\u2019s really not up to the task; nudging a horizontal PS5 even slightly to plug in peripherals and USB devices is generally enough for it to slide out of position, become crooked, or simply slip off the stand entirely. It\u2019s not an annoyance you\u2019ll run into every day, but it\u2019s a problem that only exists because the PS5\u2019s absurd, warped shape prevents it from sitting flat like a normal piece of electronic equipment. I\u2019ll happily concede the PS5 does look a bit better in the flesh than it did in the initial product shots; the matte, off-white finish to the plates is actually a lot nicer than I feared it would be, and the sloping vents flanking the strip of glossy black plastic that wraps around the edge of the unit are eye-catching. The problem, to my eye, is that the gradually widening black strip on the front and the flappy, overhanging plastic corners makes the PS5 look a little bit like a piece of luggage that\u2019s stuffed too full to zip up properly, and the irregular curves remind me more of a cassette that\u2019s spent a hot summer day on a car dashboard than a PlayStation. The PS5 is far and away the most flamboyant-looking console I\u2019ve ever owned. \u201c It\u2019s obviously not the first white game console but, in concert with its sheer size and shape, it\u2019s surprisingly ostentatious for something destined to sit beneath or beside black televisions, black sound bars, black subwoofers, and generations of black AV equipment and gaming hardware. It\u2019s a bit showy and in a world of generally sleek and simple tech it looks a bit out of place, like 2006\u2019s vision of 2046. The Cost of Maxing Out Your PS5 8 Images On the front you\u2019ll find access to the Ultra HD Blu-ray optical drive, a high-speed USB Type-A port, and a super-speed USB Type-C port, as well as the power button and eject button. These buttons are adjacent to each other but the eject button is noticeably smaller so, if you\u2019re anything like me, there\u2019s now hope of not spending an entire generation trying to remember which button is which. On the back there\u2019s the figure-8 power connection, an HDMI 2.1 out, two super-speed USB Type-A ports, and an Ethernet port. Unlike the PS4, the PS5 does not feature an optical audio out. There\u2019s now hope of not spending an entire generation trying to remember which button is which. \u201c The stand is necessary because the misshapen nature of the plates means the PS5 can\u2019t sit flat on its side properly without it. It has a pair of small hooks, which loosely clutch the back of the PS5, and a rotating base. Sitting flat, the console is simply perched on the stand without any additional fixtures. The base can flap around and slip left, right, or even off entirely, but that\u2019s something unlikely to frustrate unless you\u2019re regularly moving your console from place to place. Positioned vertically, a single screw is required to affix the stand to the console to prevent it from falling out of it. The slotted, \u201ccheese head\u201d screw comes stored in the stand itself and is easy to install; if you don\u2019t have a flat screwdriver, a knife or even your thumbnail will suffice. The Best PS5 Games 26 Images Appearances aside, there is one element of the PS5 that can\u2019t be as easily ignored, and that\u2019s the sheer size of it. Positioned vertically and perched atop its stand the PS5 is about 40cm tall (almost 16 inches). With the stand switched that figure is a fraction less when positioned horizontally, coming in at around 39cm, but even in this orientation the PS5 is still just over 11cm high (around four and a half inches) at the point where its top plate curls skyward. That\u2019s bigger than two original PS4s stacked on top of each other, bigger than the grill-sized PS3, and even the VCR-esque original Xbox One. There are only two bigger white appliances in my house: one washes my clothes, and the other keeps my butter cold. The PS5 fits in my furniture (albeit with all the subtlety of a Humvee squeezing through a drive-through) but may not fit in everyone\u2019s setup. It\u2019s quaint that this year\u2019s biggest console comes from the land of capsule hotels and kei cars and it\u2019s the American console that\u2019s more compact by comparison. Fun, Anyone? Initial set-up is extremely simple; beyond an obligatory firmware update I was up and running within minutes. For PS4 users, the PS5 manual describes the ability to connect your PS4 console and PS5 to the same network to transfer save data, downloaded content, and user information, though it doesn\u2019t outline the process . For me, the much quicker alternative was plugging in the USB hard drive I\u2019ve been using as extended storage for my PS4 for several years; it\u2019s a cinch, and the PS5 can access your existing digital PS4 games from it instantly. For long-time PlayStation users the PS5 makes it very easy to browse your whole digital library and sort between PS5 and PS4 games. Peculiarly enough there\u2019s a search field for PS3 games, too, though it comes up empty. The PS5 UI doesn\u2019t feel wildly removed from its roots on the PS4, particularly as you get deeper into the menus, but it\u2019s definitely different \u2013 and significantly more elegant in a number of ways. Now a single tap of the PlayStation button in the centre of the controller will bring up what Sony has called the Control Centre, which is a little like a taskbar on a Windows PC. Checking things like current downloads and what friends of yours are online on PS4 requires a bunch of shuffling back and forth, up and down, and left and right through menu icons; the PS5\u2019s Control Centre places all that info at our fingertips after one button press . The PS5 UI is significantly more elegant in a number of ways. \u201c The other key point of difference are dubbed Cards, which are also presented on screen when you hit the PlayStation button. Some of these are just fluff, like links to newly-published articles about games you\u2019re following on PlayStation and recent screenshots, though the Activity Cards seem to have the potential to be a little more useful. There\u2019s information about how much longer it\u2019s estimated you\u2019ll need to complete a certain level or task, or the ability to immediately view pre-made game hints without having to reach for your phone. For example, it was revealed earlier this week the PS5 remake of Demon\u2019s Souls will feature over 180 help videos that you can opt to watch if you get stuck.  The PS5\u2019s UI does make a few changes of note for those who liked to Trophy hunt, as well as for those who like to customise their setup. On the former, Trophies are now easily accessible to view on a per-game basis from each game\u2019s individual splash page on the dashboard, while Trophy info can also be included in the new Activity Card view. And on the latter, the PS5 doesn\u2019t have overall themes you can select, so your dynamic themes won\u2019t carry over. However, each PS5 game seems to come with its own mini-theme of sorts; when selecting a next-gen game on the dashboard, each game features a big piece of art alongside some music from that specific game. It may not overhaul the UI buttons like a dynamic theme could, but it\u2019s nice to let each game in your library offer a showcase for itself. The PS5\u2019s SSD is, on paper, twice as fast as the Series X's. \u201c There\u2019s other interesting stuff sprinkled throughout the PS5\u2019s UI too, though, from global settings to automatically configure difficulty, subtitle preferences, and even invert the Y-axis by default \u2013 like the Xbox 360 used to do (take note, Microsoft) \u2013 to the ability to watch a friend play a game picture-in-picture while chatting to them as you play something else entirely. I\u2019m not a particularly proficient multitasker so I can\u2019t say I\u2019m very interested in the latter, but the idea of not having to spend the opening moments of virtually every game inverting the Y-axis warms my old-school, upside-down heart. Greatness Awaits One of this generation\u2019s most important upgrades is the switch from traditional hard drives to solid-state storage drives, dramatically improving loading times across the board and potentially enabling games to load in new objects effectively on the fly. The PS5\u2019s SSD can read 5.5GB in just one second (which is, on paper, twice as fast as the Series X). In practical terms, it means I could go from powering up from a complete shutdown to perched on top of whatever Manhattan building I last left Miles Morales on in a mere 45 seconds. That still leaves time to tap your toe, but once I was in a game, the time it takes to go from selecting a save to load to actually swinging through Spider-Man: Miles Morales\u2019 open world is basically a blink . It takes me longer to enter my passcode that it does to load a save. After generations of watching progress bars inching across a screen it\u2019s pretty stunning stuff. I thought that was going to be the game-changing feature of the PS5, but to my surprise it\u2019s really the DualSense controller that boasts the biggest potential. It may feel fairly similar to the DualShock 4 at first touch but it didn\u2019t take me long to realise it\u2019s really an incredibly impressive new beast entirely. Largely the same shade of white as the console itself, the DualSense is just a fraction larger than the DualShock 4 and has a more premium look, particularly in the translucent buttons which have an almost glass-like appearance. The Options and Create buttons are also more raised than they are on the DualShock 4 so they\u2019re far easier to find without blindly rubbing your thumb beside the touchpad until you find it, or glancing down (the Create button is basically the PS5\u2019s equivalent of the PS4\u2019s Share button). The DualSense also has a built-in mic, making headsets unnecessary, but it still has a 3.5mm jack for those who prefer to use them. The charging port is USB-C. One-Year Update, November 11, 2021: I still think the pre-installed Astro\u2019s Playroom remains the best use of the PS5\u2019s great DualSense controller. Recent games haven\u2019t done too much with it, but I remain a firm believer in the potential of the DualSense overall, even though frustratingly the left stick on my included DualSense began to drift up and down a few months ago. Thankfully, the second controller I purchased not long after launch last year remains unafflicted by drift to date. It actually came as quite a rude surprise; I own between two and six controllers for every PlayStation dating back to the original, and not one has ever broken on me in 25 years \u2013 until now. The range of haptic feedback the DualSense can provide is quite astonishing. \u201c However, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that makes all the difference \u2013 and the range of haptic feedback the DualSense can provide is quite astonishing. Nuanced rumble travels from palm to palm and with a wide spectrum of effects, from almost imperceptible pulsations to massive vibrations. The triggers not only buzz with force feedback like the Xbox One controller, but also fight back and introduce a brand-new layer of immersion. It\u2019s seriously remarkable. For those of you nursing injuries or with conditions that would make some of these new features less than ideal, they can be scaled back or toggled off. PS5 DualSense Controller Review Verdict: With the DualSense, Sony has both made a more comfortable gamepad for traditional gameplay, and introduced some very exciting features. The haptics and adaptive triggers make an immediately noticeable difference in games that make use of them, and they offer the exciting potential for new and interesting gameplay experiences. Except for battery life, which remains a weak point, the DualSense controller is everything you want to see in a next-gen upgrade. \u2013Mike Epstein Score: 9 Read the full PS5 DualSense Controller Review The pre-installed Astro\u2019s Playroom is a pretty wonderful tech demo for the DualSense and well worth experimenting with \u2013 it\u2019s a rich and fabulous demonstration of the new level of feedback the DualSense can output, and an adorable tour through PlayStation\u2019s long hardware history to boot. For a hardware generation jump that\u2019s currently muddied with a lot of cross-gen content and an overall feeling of something more incremental than the often seismic shifts we\u2019ve experienced previously, the DualSense has emerged to me as a bit of a revelation. I\u2019ve had to plug it in to charge every second day since getting the PS5, but it\u2019s worth it. For the Players In the power stakes there\u2019s been a role-reversal this generation, with Microsoft\u2019s new Xbox Series X arriving with reportedly 20% more grunt than the PS5 . That said, most third-party games run perfectly fine on the PS5, so that's not a big concern. Regardless of the apparent power disparity, however, 4K/60fps experiences are poised to be more regular on PS5, just as they are on Series X. Doubling the frame rate to 120hz will also be on the cards with certain PS5 games , should your 4K TV support it, but personally I suspect I\u2019m going to get more mileage out of the better resolution and lighting effects that anybody who opts for increased frames will be forced to sacrifice. When available, will you play games in 120fps mode? Yes, give me all the frames! 60fps is enough for me - make my games pretty! Answer See Results Spider-Man: Miles Morales, for instance, has the option to switch between a 30fps \u2018Fidelity\u2019 mode with the maximum amount of visual flourishes, and a 60fps \u2018Performance\u2019 mode without things like raytracing and other advanced lighting effects (and temporal techniques providing a 4K picture from a lower-resolution base). Fidelity mode was easily my preference as without the slick lighting and real-time reflections it was a bit of an anticlimax. Despite all that horsepower under the hood the PS5 is impressively silent, and IGN\u2019s testing has pegged it at a virtually inaudible 44 decibels (at 58 degrees Celsius) in the midst of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. It\u2019s a refreshing change from my current PS4 Pro; booting up Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man on that makes it sound like it\u2019s ready to be catapulted off an aircraft carrier. Unfortunately, one of the PS5\u2019s key strengths \u2013 its lightning-quick SSD \u2013 is also one of its weaknesses. It may say 825GB on the box but that translates to just 667GB of usable space, which is significantly smaller than the Xbox Series X\u2019s 802GB of usable space. That\u2019s room for maybe a dozen games , and even fewer if they\u2019re anything like current-generation behemoths like The Last of Us Part II (78GB) or Grand Theft Auto V (94GB). As I mentioned, you can carry on using any external hard drive you may have already been using in your PS4 and continue to play PS4 games off of it, but PS5 games can only be played when installed on the SSD. One-Year Update, November 11, 2021: Certainly the most noteworthy improvement to the PS5 in the year since its launch is the ability to add additional internal SSD storage, which is a big deal because the 667GB that comes included feels even smaller now than it did at launch. The compartment to do so has been inside the PS5 from the beginning, but until the September 2021 update putting a drive in there would just give you an error message. Now, we can install our own M.2 SSD drives, which currently range from 250GB to 4TB monsters that can cost more than two PS5s alone. The fact that it uses off-the-shelf M.2 drives gives the PS5 more flexibility than the Xbox Series X and its expansion cards, which only come in three sizes up to 2TB. At the same time, the install process is certainly more involved than the Xbox's proprietary plug-and-play expansion cards, but once you get over the anxiety of opening up your PS5 it\u2019s not prohibitively so: after popping off the top shell, the only tool you\u2019ll need is a Phillip\u2019s Head screwdriver. Inserting the SSD is straightforward enough, and then you\u2019re done. Really it\u2019s the purchase of the SSD itself that\u2019s the key hurdle; make sure you pick one that\u2019s been tested to work with the PS5. PS5 games can be stored on an external HDD but need to be copied back to the SSD to play , which is obviously a lot faster than redownloading entire games. The near-instantaneous loading times for PS5 games make this palatable, although it\u2019s worth noting that losing time saved during loading to the task of moving stuff around when my SSD invariably fills up may feel a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul."

        "Content": "I keep wanting to love Atlas Fallen. I mean, it\u2019s a delightful Prince of Persia-inspired open-world action RPG with big ideas, big monsters, and even bigger weapons to fight them with, so it\u2019s got that going for it. And I did enjoy myself as I explored each of its four unique zones, which stretch as far as the eye can see and deliver some mouthwatering, if kinda washed out, vistas. After spending about 18 hours with its mix of respectable monster slaying and brisk platforming, I can comfortably say it\u2019s a good time \u2013 especially if you bring a friend into its seamless drop-in co-op. At the same time, its C-tier story is so campy and bone-dry \u2013 in both writing and character performance \u2013 that it\u2019s clear Atlas has fallen a notch or two. The middling story, which centers around a generic clash between a human rebellion and a tyrannical regime, starts out rough. No, there are relatively few bugs and the opening is pretty short \u2013 I mean, like, physically rough for my custom avatar, a rugged yet scholarly desert dweller. After a few introductory conversations with other desert dwellers in the first area, it was promptly implied that he\u2019d been blasted in the face with a whole bunch of sand and left for dead before the opening cutscene, which kinda sucks considering his indentured servitude as one of the Unnamed. That\u2019s the bottom caste of Atlas Fallen\u2019s sand-strewn medieval world \u2013 which, as we learn through some apocalyptic mumbo jumbo narration \u2013 is ruled by an evil sun god named Thelos and ravaged by giant sand monsters called wraiths. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask This is a pretty cool setup, but the execution of the plot that follows is thinner than the middle of an hourglass. For example, poorly synced lip movements and unenthusiastic voice acting sap the life out of cutscenes. On top of that, there\u2019s no action in any of them, so they\u2019re pretty dull \u2013 and each of Atlas\u2019 major characters is a cardboard cutout with no personality to speak of. You\u2019ve got the generic thief with the heart of gold, the upstanding knight girl who introduces herself by punching said golden-hearted thief in the face (but secretly has a soft spot the whole time,) and Nyaal, the other sun god. He spends his waking hours talking at you while looking like a knockoff of Jake Sully from Avatar , but more importantly, he inhabits the magical gauntlet at the center of the story which gives you your powers and a new hope for the rebellion against Thelos and his imperialist thugs. Unfortunately, this sun god is always there with you and rarely shuts up. It\u2019s easily one of the best games to share between two online friends since It Takes Two. \u201c Luckily, if you can ignore all that, it\u2019s relatively easy to see Atlas Fallen\u2019s joy as an online co-op adventure where you and a friend run around a sprawling open world battling monsters. It\u2019s a well-crafted map, with plenty of opportunity to unearth rare treasures, build up powerful characters, fight big monsters, do a little platforming \u2013 or just chill out and collect cosmetics for the excellent transmogrification system to your heart\u2019s content. It balances simplicity and depth so expertly that it\u2019s easily one of the best games to share between two online friends since It Takes Two. That\u2019s especially true when you get into the rhythm of the open questing system: this game lets you complete side-quests and interstitials between major story events separately while enjoying the same rewards \u2013 even when you\u2019re across the world from one another. Given just how many main story quests scatter you to the wind in search of hidden gauntlet pieces, it\u2019s fantastic to be able to freely split up and cover more ground \u2013 who knows, your friend might find something you missed instead of making you run around in circles or backtrack by yourself. That said, it\u2019s a missed opportunity that couch co-op is nowhere to be found, and it\u2019s thoroughly disappointing there\u2019s no cross-play to let you and your buddies on other platforms team up. What game makes the best use of sand? Prince of Persia Journey Super Mario Bros 3 Battlefield 1 Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results It\u2019s clear that the main quest is paced around unlocking new mechanics rather than telling a good story. Atlas Fallen spreads its story across four open-world maps, such as the underground fortress of Bastengar and the crater-filled Wildlands, each of which carries a distinct vibe and is packed with enough hidden treasure and decently rewarding side-quests to feel like there\u2019s always something new to find. Fetch quests make up the bulk of it, with Nyaal frequently asking you to \u201cfind three shards\u201d to complete the latest relic and achieve the next major gauntlet upgrade. But I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to work overly hard to find each of the scattered components, and the rewards were always worthwhile. For instance, unlocking the triple air dash was a game-changer that let me reach distant ledges, and Reveal lets you manipulate ancient artifacts that reveal hidden platforming challenges you didn\u2019t even know were there. Both of these new abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas, giving all four zones extra room to breathe and slowly unravel themselves to those willing to backtrack. But Atlas Fallen doesn\u2019t power-gate its best loot behind that kind of repeated searching, meaning you can choose to only do the main story, skip all that extra spelunking, and comfortably beat the rather underwhelming final boss without the added trouble. Boss fights, quests, and random finds often give way to useful loot, armor, and Essence Stones. \u201c That said, the one thing you can\u2019t skip is sand. Your weapons are made of sand, you move around quickly by surfing across sand dunes, and each of the various monsters is literally made of sand. The only things not made of sand are the many anvils found dotted across the world of Atlas Fallen, which serve as places to save your game, upgrade your armor, and fast-travel to other anvils.

Boss fights, quests, and random finds often give way to useful loot, armor, and Essence Stones that contribute to the deep customization and combat systems. Granted, many of these finds are cosmetic or simply merchant fodder with some bits of lore attached, but all the rare crafting items and Essence Dust (basically, Atlas\u2019 version of experience points) make all that treasure-hunting feel worthwhile, even when there isn\u2019t another powerful Essence Stone or armor piece around the next corner. Meanwhile, power climb feels steady from start to finish \u2013 making combat encounters balanced as you venture into higher level zones, without making you grind for it \u2013 as long as you\u2019re upgrading your armor, perks, Idols, Essence Stones, and Momentum Gauge at an anvil every so often. Those all help with a different aspect of character customization, but the main driver is your armor, which determines your character\u2019s level and most of your combat stats like how much damage your attacks deal and how quickly your health can regenerate mid-combat. The twist is that your character\u2019s movement style changes depending on which weapon you strike with. \u201c Speaking of combat, Atlas Fallen\u2019s action-packed battles are simple but highly dynamic, thanks to a small number of moves that grow in power as you land hits. Fights center around two basic attacks that work differently based on the weapon you assign them to, but the twist is that your character\u2019s movement style changes depending on which weapon you strike with. For instance, the sword-like Sandwhip homes in on an enemy from a distance before pushing you backward, letting you whip around the enemy mid-air if you dodge around mid-combo like Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Alternatively, the punchy Knuckledust lunges you forward as you pulverize your opponents with both hands. There are three of these, and they all encourage very different styles. Atlas Fallen Screenshots (March 2023) 11 Images Atlas Fallen also includes a deeply satisfying parry button, offering a generous window to counter enemy attacks, and a perfectly timed parry can turn the tides of any battle by freezing opponents. There\u2019s also a two-handed slam attack that combines the styles of both equipped weapons, and you can top a chain of attacks off with an extremely powerful finishing move. That\u2019s plenty to keep anyone busy in a typical encounter against a group of two or three large enemies like the marauding Tailguarder and the giant crab-like Shellbasher. And it\u2019s a lot of fun to bring these bigger foes down piece by piece \u2013 it reminds me of hunting Rathalos across a vast desert in Monster Hunter. It\u2019s a lot of fun to bring these bigger foes down piece by piece. \u201c I\u2019m delighted at how Atlas keeps a nice balance between its moment-to-moment smashing and slashing and its resource management systems. This is thanks to the Momentum Gauge, which fills up as you land direct hits and successful parries against enemies, gradually unlocking abilities you\u2019ve slotted along the gauge. These collectable abilities make up the meat of Atlas Fallen\u2019s customization, and they can be crafted, upgraded, and mixed and matched to build any sort of character you\u2019d want \u2013 including healers, damage dealers, crowd controllers, tanks, you name it. One of my favorite Essence Stones is the Evasive Burst, which creates a shockwave after every dodge roll or air dash while active. This let me deal incredible amounts of damage while whipping around airborne foes with the Sandwhip. The 10 Best Open World Games 11 Images The catch is that it can be difficult to maintain high momentum since you receive more damage as your gauge reaches its limit. This risk and reward element keeps things interesting, since the strongest abilities sit on the upper end of the gauge, and it\u2019s always tempting to unleash your highly gratifying finishing move to deal heavy damage at the cost of reducing your gauge to zero. It all comes together toward the end of the campaign, where every other fight has several enemy types filling the screen with lighting effects and clouds of yellowy dust \u2013 it\u2019s kind of like the heavier moments of Doom Eternal, but with sand instead of viscera. Compressed textures, low-quality models, and graininess look flat-out ugly on my PS5. \u201c I\u2019ve developed what I can best describe as a \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship with Atlas Fallen\u2019s visual style. I\u2019d often be wowed at how gorgeous some of its zones look \u2013 some of it made me feel as if I were standing inside a piece of elegant concept art. Especially once I\u2019d unlocked my favorite suit of armor: Red Company, a suit that gleams brilliantly in direct sunlight as tufts of fabric unfurl around it. That looks fantastic on its own, but even better once I\u2019ve dyed it with gold and blue dye I purchased from a traveling merchant. I\u2019m also pleased that Atlas Fallen produces consistently high frames in the PS5\u2019s Performance mode, but I\u2019m not as impressed that it struggles with its fidelity even in Graphics mode \u2013 which is a shame because of how pretty and detailed its zones and armor designs are. Many of its animations are clunky, but what really bothers me is the compressed textures, low-quality models, and graininess that look flat-out ugly on my PS5 in both visual modes, as if I were playing a poorly made port of a Nintendo Switch game. Atlas looks much clearer on PC with none of the aforementioned compression issues, but its character models still evoke the uncanny valley more than most games."

        "Content": "The Switch version of Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered runs (somewhat surprisingly) as well as the console version, and looks almost as good doing it. After spending a few hours in smashing my way through its open world and demolition challenges, I noticed a few slowdowns here and there during particularly destructive moments, but nothing that rendered it \"unplayable.\" It looks great in handheld mode and doesn't suffer any noticeable downgrades compared to console versions when sent to a TV, either. It'll never look as crisp as the 4K/60FPS of the console version, but its 1080p/30FPS looks just fine. The controls themselves are, by default, a bit clunky since the Switch's Joy-Cons are far from ideal when looking for precision aim during a firefight. However, adjusting the sensitivity or enabling the gyroscopic motion controls can provide a viable enough workaround for this, though your best experience will likely be on the Pro Controller. The Nintendo Switch version of what is arguably Red Faction's best series entry is a viable way to get into its destructible world if - by some tragic circumstance - you've already missed out on it for the last decade. That said, while collapsing Mars's bridges and buildings in handheld mode is novel fun, and there's nothing particularly wrong with the port when it's displayed on a TV, there are better, more enjoyable ways to get your ass back to Mars. When we first reviewed Red Faction: Guerrilla in 2009 , we gave it an 8.0, for Great. Here\u2019s what we said about it back then:  If all you care about is blasting things to pieces, you're going to love Red Faction: Guerrilla. Seeing a tower topple to the ground in a seemingly realistic fashion after smacking away its support beams with a sledgehammer is really a thrill, and though it may lose its appeal as you continue through the lengthy campaign, it's still worth checking out, particularly after you unlock some of the better weapons. What's more disappointing about Volition's effort is the rocky mission design, bland artistic style, weak plot and anemic character development, which shifts too much focus to the element of destruction to maintain a level of excitement. Its enjoyable gunplay mechanics, along with the weapons and opportunity for tearing apart structures, carry over into the online space, where Volition has built an impressive multiplayer suite that includes stat tracking, unlocks, and a number of game modes that focus on flattening buildings. While the game may not do everything right, it's your best bet for free-form demolition and unpretentious entertainment. - Charles Onyett  Even almost a decade later, Red Faction: Guerrilla is still my gold standard for destructible environments in games. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a testament to Volition\u2019s GeoMod engine or an indictment of modern games\u2019 lack of devotion to freeform demolition, but either way, Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered still makes it insanely satisfying to level an enemy base with little more than a few demo charges and a big hammer. 15 Images It\u2019s not likely to fool anyone into thinking it\u2019s brand-new. \u201c The updates to lighting, shadows, shaders, and post-processing effects combine with improved textures to make a convincing argument that this game didn\u2019t come out before Assassin\u2019s Creed 2. It\u2019s not likely to fool anyone into thinking it\u2019s brand-new, of course \u2013 the pre-rendered cinematics alone give away that it\u2019s not up to modern standards, and certain textures, especially those on the Martian soil, are sub-par and repetitive. It does perform reasonably well, though: it runs at 60 frames per second in 1080p on standard consoles or in \u201c4K\u201d Performance mode on the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X (technically, 1500p and 1800p, respectively), with frame rates only occasionally taking more than a slight dip during even the most destructive battles. We did, however, notice some considerable slowdown during big explosions playing in full 4K resolution. All of the upgrades in this new version are visual, though \u2013 aside from the bundled-in DLC from the original, there\u2019s no new content to be found anywhere in Re-Mars-tered for returning players. No new guns or explosives, vehicles, buildings, missions, challenges, or behind the scenes featurettes or commentaries. That means the original\u2019s problems remain intact, such as the vast swaths of Martain terrain that don\u2019t contain anything worth swinging a hammer at. While that\u2019s probably an accurate depiction of what a recently colonized planet might look like, it doesn\u2019t make for particularly interesting gameplay when you just want to get to the next clump of buildings you plan to destroy. Nothing\u2019s been done to spruce up or expand the story, either, which is still about as exciting as trip to the DMV. Still, there\u2019s tons of fun to be had experimenting with physics, both in the open world and the separate challenge modes and PvP matches."

        "Content": "The best thing about playing Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is that it makes me feel over-the-top powerful without sacrificing the fear of defeat. It\u2019s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is what\u2019s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning. A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as Talion, a former Ranger of Gondor, is ritually executed along with his family. Talion\u2019s spirit is then bound to an amnesiac elf ghost and returned to Middle-earth for vengeance against Sauron\u2019s forces. It\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars, but it\u2019s well-acted. It makes decent use of Gollum, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly Ratbag the comic-relief uruk, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army. My interest in the plot dwindled toward the end, but it does a fair job of explaining why Talion has such sweet supernatural powers with his sword, dagger, and bow. Much like in the Batman: Arkham games, you can choose to stealthily pick off enemies one at a time, or dive head-first into a brawl with dozens of opponents and beat the crap out of them with a smoothly animated series of attacks and counters. Unlike Batman, of course, Mordor\u2019s involve great, gory decapitation and stabbing animations, and outside of the scripted story missions, there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas. It\u2019s enticingly freeform. Acrobatically slaughtering Sauron\u2019s ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jackson\u2019s movies, and it\u2019s more fun to do than to watch. Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman \u2013 which is to say it\u2019s amazing. Mordor\u2019s take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that you\u2019re almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what he\u2019s doing and counter instantly. It\u2019s extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though it\u2019s kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, it\u2019s great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know you\u2019re there. What really sets the feel of Mordor\u2019s combat apart from the Batman games is that it\u2019s really easy to get into trouble, especially early on. If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds, or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map, you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle. Picking out the shield bearers and ax-wielding berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when you\u2019re completely surrounded, and it goes downhill from there. Health doesn\u2019t recharge much on its own, and until you can upgrade your health pool, you may find yourself succumbing to death by a thousand pinpricks if you don\u2019t retreat. Things got a lot easier a few hours in when I\u2019d leveled up and unlocked more of Talion\u2019s skill tree so that I could build up combos quicker, execute two enemies for the price of one, and even fight mounted on a huge, rancor-like graug who pops uruks into his mouth like jellybeans. It feels powerful, but I still don\u2019t feel invincible even with everything nearly maxed out. And what\u2019s really cool about Mordor is that whether you win or lose a fight, something interesting happens. If you kill an uruk captain, he drops a rune that can be slotted into one of your weapons for bonuses. Some of them changed the way I played, like the legendary rune that extended the amount of time I have to score another hit before my combo count resets by 10 seconds, and one that made me immune to poison attacks. If any uruk kills you, even if he\u2019s a random grunt, he levels up and earns new abilities and some cooler armor. Maybe he gets promoted up the chain of command. You\u2019ll definitely run into him again later to settle the score, and he\u2019ll have a new introduction taunt about his victory when you meet. It makes each death feel meaningful. Most uruk captains do tend to die too quickly to really become memorable, but some definitely did. (Sometimes they\u2019ll survive being apparently killed by you and come back with a scarred face.) For that reason, and to identify the arrival of a significant threat, I never really got tired of the action-pausing cutscenes that play when a captain shows up. There are enough different voices and multiple possible lines that I rarely saw repeats, and the uruk faces are surprisingly well animated and expressive. Even though the hierarchy is a pretty simple system when you understand what it\u2019s doing, and realize that these uruk captains aren\u2019t actually roaming the map in real time, it\u2019s great to play with. Uruks have an internal power struggle for rank, and you can interrupt their duels, feasts, hunts, and more to pick fights and kill off Uruk captains and ultimately the powerful Warchiefs. Each captain has his own randomized strengths and vulnerabilities, so every fight is at least a little different. I ran into a couple of guys who seemed invulnerable to almost everything, which was a little annoying \u2013 one fight took me about 15 minutes of repeatedly chasing down a captain who was invulnerable to my sword and dagger and filling him with arrows trying to damage him faster than his health regenerated. Eventually, though, they all went down. In the second act, you transition from the bleak, brown map to a refreshingly greener-looking area of Mordor. There, Talion and his elf-ghost buddy suddenly realize he can mind-control uruks and turn them against each other. (It feels like something might\u2019ve been cut out there.) That\u2019s even more fun, because the ability to \u201cbrand\u201d an enemy gives you the choice of either killing a captain for a rune reward or controlling him and siccing him on one of his former allies. Taking an uruk alive can be trickier than lopping off his head, though, so it\u2019s more challenging to accomplish the new goal of mind-controlling five Warchiefs. I love how you have the option to mind-control a Warchief\u2019s lieutenants, then kill the Warchief, to watch your minion become the new Warchief. I did notice that the mind-control visual effect caused some slowdown on the PlayStation 4 version (the Xbox One version has yet to arrive for testing), but it didn\u2019t interfere much with combat. Charging through the decent but less-exciting story missions would probably take around 12 hours, but the goal of killing or dominating the Warchiefs is much more time-consuming and interesting. I spent around 25 hours to reach the end, and there\u2019s still a lot of challenging side missions based around testing sword, bow, and dagger skills left to do. And, of course, lots of collectables and wildlife-hunting challenges. 6GB? Now THOSE are textures! On the PC side Mordor also compares to the Batman games, in that it\u2019s of good quality. There are even some enhanced graphics settings, including an ultra-high texture setting that requires a full 6GB of video memory. My only issue with it is some awkward menu controls, but most of those are customizable and those that aren\u2019t aren\u2019t too inconvenient to get used to. Xbox One Version - September 30, 2014 After a day with Shadow of Mordor on Xbox One, I can confidently recommend it just as strongly as the PS4 and PC versions. True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin - the PS4 runs at a slightly higher resolution and the PC has better lighting than either (and all the resolution your hardware can handle) - but it performs at roughly the same clip as the PS4 version and provides effectively the same experience. That means what appears to our eyes to be a framerate that fluctuates somewhere between 30 and 60, excluding occasional slowdowns when \"combat-branding\" an uruk in the midst of a large group of enemies. If you have an Xbox One, there's no reason to avoid this version."

We regret the error and really like Resident Evil 2.]  I have fond memories of playing the original Resident Evil 2 in my dorm room at the University of Kansas back in 1998 and thinking the CGI cutscenes looked incredibly realistic. (Oh, 1998 Daemon, you had so much to learn!) Another great gaming recollection of mine is playing the 2002 remake of the first Resident Evil on GameCube with its beautifully updated visuals, completely new areas to explore, and terrifying new enemies. Now, in 2019, Capcom has given me a new experience I\u2019ll remember for a long time: this ground-up remake of Resident Evil 2 is a very fun, very creepy adventure thanks to its completely new and modern graphics, controls, and some smart quality-of-life improvements. The two playable characters\u2019 stories aren\u2019t as different as I\u2019d hoped, but I enjoyed nearly every gory minute of my return to Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield\u2019s shoes.  I hadn\u2019t played the original Resident Evil 2 since its release 20 years ago and only remembered the broadest of strokes: I knew it largely took place in a police station, the Lickers were introduced, and the giant spiders in the sewers were a nightmare. If a similar amount of time has passed for you, or if you\u2019ve never played it, it might not be apparent what an enormous improvement this remake is unless you look at it side-by-side with the original. That\u2019s because instead of the usual remastering treatment where we see upgraded resolution and textures hung over an old game\u2019s skeleton, here Capcom started from scratch and remade the whole thing using the RE Engine, which is the tech that powered Resident Evil 7.  These are the best-looking zombies I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. \u201c Now, instead of pixelated characters running from pre-rendered background to pre-rendered background, Resident Evil 2 is a fully 3D, over-the-shoulder affair with atmospheric lighting effects, impressive facial animations, and the best-looking zombies I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. They\u2019re juicier than ever (I\u2019d venture a guess the designers were heavily inspired by the Tarman from Return of the Living Dead) and I love the way they lurch around and react when you blow off very specific chunks of their heads and hands courtesy of the satisfyingly detailed dismemberment system. Capcom does noticeably reuse the same handful of zombie models, though. Especially later on in the story, you\u2019ll likely recognize the same undead faces you blew off way back at the police station.  Some events have been rearranged or expanded upon and there are some surprising twists I didn\u2019t remember, but this is a mostly loyal remake of the suitably dark and twisted story of Resident Evil 2. It\u2019s two months after the zombie outbreak of the first Resident Evil, which took place mostly in a spooky mansion. The horror has now overrun the entirety of Raccoon City, which is divided into three large areas that serve as the story\u2019s acts. Exploring its dark hallways, solving puzzles, and hoping to god there isn\u2019t a zombie around the next corner all remains fun today. Charting each area, learning the lay of the land, and eventually overcoming the obstacles in your way really never gets old. There are statues with hidden compartments everywhere, mutated reptiles stalk the sewers, and there\u2019s a vast scientific lab buried underground. None of it holds up against much scrutiny, but they\u2019re all fun places to explore.  Our heroes Leon and Claire, meanwhile, have strolled into town at a really bad time and are almost immediately separated. The pair is likable enough but two dimensional in their unwavering heroism. They never have a moment of despair or self doubt, and that makes them a bit dull, whereas a couple of the side characters are more charismatic and interesting. The mysterious Ada Wong in Leon\u2019s campaign keeps you questioning her motives and wondering whose side she\u2019s really on, for example. This is real survival horror, where it always seems like you\u2019re just barely scraping by. \u201c Crucially, inventory and ammunition management is still a key part of Resident Evil 2\u2019s gameplay. This is real survival horror, where it always seems like you\u2019re just barely scraping by with enough ammo and healing items. You can\u2019t carry everything you find with you, so what you should store and what you should carry is a battle constantly being waged in your mind. Those quality-of-life improvements I mentioned include automatically updating your maps to let you know if a room has been cleared of items or if you missed something, frequent and unlimited save points, and freedom from the infamous barrage of loading screens. All of those are very much appreciated when exploring Raccoon City. Tension has been elevated by the excellent sound design. Very little music accompanies gameplay, which leaves plenty of room for creaking doors, thunder and rain, the moans of the undead somewhere just out of sight, and heavy footsteps of something sinister in the next room over. Resident Evil 2 gets atmosphere like nobody\u2019s business. Every IGN Resident Evil Game Review Ever 60 Images  The real chiller in the first two-thirds of the campaign is the Tyrant super-zombie. He appears early on to stalk you, and his emotionless face and steady, unstoppable gait make him Resident Evil\u2019s worthy counterpart to Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. Hearing his relentless footsteps getting louder and louder, knowing there is nothing I can do to stop him, filled me with a true sense of dread. Eventually, though, his presence becomes more obnoxious than terrifying, when you\u2019re trying to solve a puzzle and advance the story and the big lug just won\u2019t take a hint and reside elsewhere. Leon and Claire take extremely similar paths. \u201c  I beat the story from Leon\u2019s point of view in eight hours, which felt a little short, but I was excited to fire up Claire\u2019s campaign and see the fateful evening\u2019s events unfold from an entirely new perspective. Unfortunately, whomever you play as in the main game mode, Resident Evil 2 will be largely the same when you finish and switch to the other person\u2019s 2nd Game mode. While there are a handful of new locations, many quest items are shuffled to new locations so you need to hunt for them again, and you\u2019ll see more and deadlier enemies sooner in the campaign, most of the same events happen. Leon and Claire take extremely similar paths, meet most of the same people, solve most of the same puzzles, and fight most of the same bosses the other one did the first time through. (In an earlier version of this review I mistakenly played through the first versions of Leon and Claire\u2019s stories back to back, which are even more similar. Having now played Leon\u2019s 2nd Game, I\u2019m still disappointed that there\u2019s only marginally more new things to see and do there.) Their play styles aren\u2019t entirely identical, at least: If you play as Leon first you may get used to dispatching enemies with his shotgun and flame thrower, and when you return as Claire you\u2019ll have to learn how to adapt your playstyle and make do with a submachine gun and grenade launcher. Plus, each hero meets a unique, important person who causes them to deviate from the shared path for a short time, and there\u2019s a different final boss fight at the end. I enjoyed all of it, though the repetition of so much content made it significantly less entertaining the second time through. Those small differences aren\u2019t quite enough to justify a second playthrough of a very similar campaign.  As much as Capcom added to Resident Evil 2, a couple things are noticeably missing. Those giant spiders I remembered being terrified of? Not here. I was really looking forward to being scared by more realistic monster arachnids. (At least this is good news for arachnophobes who\u2019ve missed out on Resident Evil 2 up to this point.) Also, when you press start at the title screen, no cartoonishly scary voice says \u201cResident Evil!\u201d Big miss."

        "Content": "As I explore the atmospheric hallways of Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster, I\u2019m conflicted. I\u2019ve always enjoyed the games from the early years of this series -- the original take on survival horror made clever use of fixed camera angles, limited resources, and stiff controls to create a distinct style of fear. And this HD update looks and plays like a modern game, and so is certainly the best way to experience this particular game. However, the superficial improvements that successfully update this old school Resident Evil game\u2019s look and feel can\u2019t cover up its deeper underlying problems: predictable pacing, weak story, and forgettable enemies. None of what was wrong with the original is fixed in this version.  I\u2019ll give it this much: Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster looks good, thanks to improved lighting and updated textures that bring character models and environments up to modern standards. I noticed only occasional framerate hiccups on the Xbox One version. PC players get a better visual experience, with support for higher resolutions and an option for smoother 60 frames-per-second animations.  Spooky Sights and Sounds  Regardless of which platform you choose to experience this HD Remaster, it does a great job of preserving Resident Evil\u2019s old-school pre-rendered backgrounds. It surprises me just how well they hold up. You can see wine bottles gently rolling back and forth on a moving train, or glimpse your character\u2019s reflection in hallway mirrors. Little touches like these contribute greatly to the dark, desolate environments and create an evocative atmosphere that sticks with you.  Little touches... create an evocative atmosphere that sticks with you \u201c  In a touch that serves both the purist and newcomer audience, this version can bounce between the original 4:3 aspect ratio and a 16:9 view that zooms in and crops off the top and bottom of the image. The closer camera lets you get a better look at the characters and environments, which I found hard to go back from when I switched, but there\u2019s a catch: it can sometimes obscure important items easily seen in 4:3 mode. The camera will slowly pan up or down to highlight them, but by that time I\u2019d sometimes already moved on thinking there was nothing of note in the room. Additionally, while purists can keep the original tank-style controls, the default mode is an updated scheme that makes moving and bouncing between the two characters in the campaign easy and approachable.   On the other hand, the blurry, upscaled cutscenes didn\u2019t get the same treatment. These CG-rendered story sequences look dated (because they are) and don\u2019t even come close to fidelity of the refreshed in-game character models. It\u2019s a shame Capcom made no effort to redo them.  Another thing that wasn\u2019t improved that should\u2019ve been is Resident Evil Zero\u2019s constant inventory juggling act, which remains every bit as tedious as it was in 2002. While it\u2019s true that the series has always used limited resources and carrying capacity to create tension and tough decisions, this chapter overburdens you with too much of inventory management. Rebecca and Billy can hold very few items, with larger weapons that take away up to two of a potential six precious slots of inventory space.  The inventory overload is a bummer, since both characters have interesting characteristics -- Rebecca can mix together herbs and create helpful recovery items while Billy can push around heavy objects and take more damage. You have to keep their differences in mind when you solve puzzles or fight off monsters.  Predictably Evil  The improved presentation and controls feel fruitless since Resident Evil Zero is a such a by-the-numbers story. The six to eight-hour campaign wastes a bunch of time explaining things, in an attempt to build up some context around the first Resident Evil, but ends up with a lots of unsurprising reveals. Resident Evil was never the paragon of voice acting and story, but the series still sustained itself with entertaining campaigns and fun characters. Zero\u2019s awful story borders on self-parody and, as a long-time fan of the series, feels almost as disappointing as a Star Wars prequel.  \"...mutant creatures and bosses appear exactly where and when you\u2019re led to expect them to\" \u201c  Predictability also plays a major role in Resident Evil Zero\u2019s story woes. For instance, mutant creatures and bosses appear exactly where and when you\u2019re led to expect them to, and if you listen close enough, you can almost hear the bottom of the zombie monster barrel getting scraped clean when unremarkable monsters like Plague Crawler -- a mutated insect that looks like a lame cross between a mantis and grasshopper -- or the Eliminator -- a silly mutated primate -- show up. The Marcus Mimicry, a horrid leech monster that pops up in various spots throughout the story, is the one scary thing here, and it\u2019s squandered by the campaign.  The only bit of new content added to this remaster is an unlockable mode that lets you replay the same poor story as recurring villain Albert Wesker. Though using his enhanced super-abilities was more fun than the first time around, it feels like an awkward apology for the rest of Resident Evil Zero\u2019s bland and forgettable attempt at survival horror. Outside of nostalgia, there\u2019s not much reason to revisit it."

        "Content": "The Last Remnant is a game I wanted to like. If you like turn-based role-playing games, you probably will want to like it too. The longer you play it, though, the less appetizing it becomes. The Last Remnant is a game that falls short in nearly every way it can. While playing I occasionally found myself having fun, only to run into frustration, technical flaws, and confused game design. This is not a good JRPG.  The Last Remnant tells the tale of Rush Sykes, a young man who witnesses his sister's kidnapping. Rather than ask his researcher parents for help, he sets off to save her himself. In this world of monsters and mystical remnants of a lost civilization, that can prove to be a perilous task indeed. As the game progresses, you'll learn that this is much more than a simple kidnapping for ransom. Rush and his sister have a special significance.   The problems begin with technical issues. Simply put, The Last Remnant is a coding disaster. Square Enix may have licensed the Unreal Engine 3, the same tools used to make Gears of War, but the developers clearly did not know how to use it. There are such serious framerate issues during combat that what you see on your television sometimes resembles a slideshow. It sullies the entire experience and can even get in the way of gameplay since The Last Remnant has a critical system that requires you to perform timed button presses. The trouble continues with loading, which is laborious given the number of times you go in and out of a fight or change rooms. Once it does get loaded, you'll find awkward texture pop-in which can hurt the visual fidelity of cutscenes and kill any power or emotions they might convey.  The technical performance of The Last Remnant is so poor that I can't believe anybody considered the game finished and ready to release. Things get better if you install the game on your hard drive using the New Xbox Experience dashboard, but it is by no means fixed. All of the problems are still there in slightly less disastrous form. If you don't have a hard drive, The Last Remnant isn't worth the time of day.  Even the aspects that the near-broken game engine doesn't hinder still fall short. The animations in The Last Remnant are downright bad (just get a load of the main character running). And since Square Enix opted for in-engine cutscenes, that means you get the same lame animations during every conversation and the lip syncing is oftentimes creepy looking. During battles, the camera is sometimes placed too close to your characters, rendering them partially see-through or totally invisible. You might even find yourself looking at your character standing inside a dragon's tail while attacking said lizard. The Last Remnant is sloppy at best.   Some of the environments look wonderful, while others are bland and empty. If you have a lot of patience and don't mind a game that stutters far more than any game should, you might be able to look past the technical shortcomings and get into the thick of things. What you'll find there is a halfhearted attempt at modernizing the turn-based style of role-playing. While some aspects of The Last Remnant are fresh and intriguing, none of it seems well thought out and it still suffers from a lot of outdated design.  Take the save system as a first example. You can save anywhere in a dungeon or town. It's nice not dealing with save points, an outdated RPG mechanic, but there are no checkpoints in The Last Remnant. That means that if you walk through a door and happen upon a tough fight, you had better hope you saved your game just prior. You won't have any way of knowing that you're about to happen upon something out of your league, though. This system made me paranoid while playing and I felt compelled to save my progress every five minutes. That saved me from some frustration but it definitely isn't an ideal way to play a game. What's more, the game will sometimes thrust you into a series of boss battles without giving you the option to save in between. Play through two and lose on the third and you'll have to start from scratch. Some of the extended battles that keep adding new enemies as you kill others (one featured nearly 100 foes) can last an hour and you can't save or run from the fight midway. Lose at the end of that one and you'll likely give up instead of replaying the sequence a second or third time.   Rather than following the tried and true method of turn-based role-playing where your squad lines up against enemies and takes turns swatting them, The Last Remnant mixes things up a bit with a union system. Instead of having a group of four or so guys you'll have up to five unions, each with up to five units. You then give a general command to each union and watch the battle rage. It speeds up the process of commanding over a dozen characters, but it definitely has its limitations.  The good news with the combat system is that it uses a cinematic camera that swoops from one unit to the next while the turn unfolds in front of you. It takes location into account, along with a number of other stats, so each battle has the chance to be a bit different from the one prior. It would actually be pretty cool if technical problems didn't handcuff it.   Not being able to directly control all of your units can be frustrating. However, it does have serious limitations. The fact that you're not giving direct commands and only get a choice of a few general options can be amazingly frustrating. If you choose to heal, The Last Remnant might not pick the target that needs it the most. Sometimes it didn't give me the option to heal at all when I wanted to. Not having complete control over your unions speeds up the process of fighting smaller battles, but made me despise the game during tough fights. What's worse, you don't have control over what items your party members equip. Only Rush is customizable. The rest of the crew will sometimes ask you for accessories, weapons, or upgrade components, but you have to wait for them to do so. If you have a really cool extra accessory or weapon that you want to give to one of your party members, you can't. And they might never ask for it even if it is leaps and bounds better than what they currently have.  Most of the pre-planning for battles then becomes a matter of setting up how your party will enter the fight. The idea is to set your unions up in a way that maximizes each character's strengths by putting complementary units in the same union and fiddling with formations. By completing side-quests you can unlock new leaders to add to the mix offering even more customization options.  And then the game designers rendered this setup rather pointless. Near the start of the game you get five leaders plus your main character. By the end, you can only have six in the active party at once. And, of course, the six you start with are the main side-characters in the game that can do things like limit breaks and offer unique powers. The entire idea of swapping them out for lesser leaders is just pointless. The game then becomes a matter of filling out your unions with lame, generic soldiers which can just be recruited by paying a small fee. There is absolutely no reason to care about anybody other than the group you start with.  Further exacerbating things is the randomness that appears to play into each fight. Some of the boss fights can be exceptionally difficult, yet beating them only seemed to be a matter of luck. I beat the boss at the end of the first disc when he decided to do an attack that did no damage and only affected morale five straight times. While playing the final boss, I once entered the fight with the game offering me several limit breaks right off the bat. When I reloaded and tried again, I didn't get the special moves at all.   You only get to manage the inventory of the main character. This lack of sensibility carries through to the main story progression and menu setup. Item descriptions are vague to the point of being useless. The main quest often gives vague or misleading directions on what to do next leaving you in the dark as to where to go or what to do. If two characters tell me to talk to them when I'm ready to go, why do they then teleport to other corners of the town to hide? And when I do find them, why did nobody tell me that there was in fact a third guy in another corner (who plays no other role in the game than this moment) that I had to talk to before I could go on. This actually happened in The Last Remnant and is just one example of the general nonsense.  And if you're hoping for an exciting story to save The Last Remnant, you can give up on that dream. In fact, the story elements are comparatively absent for a JRPG. It's a two-disc game, but there's only enough story to carry about a third of that. The vast majority of Last Remnant is spent fighting battles with little time spent in towns or in story sequences. The entire second disc only has a handful of plot points and is instead filled with lots of generic extended battles. The Last Remnant really takes a nose dive on the second disc, capped with a disappointing ending that is trite and completely unoriginal.  It seems that the makers of The Last Remnant missed the point. Rather than crafting a cohesive story with exciting side quests and areas to explore, they chose to make the game long simply for the sake of it being long. Sometimes there are extended battles seemingly only for the purpose of extending the experience. What you end up with is a long game -- one that easily took me well over 50 or 60 hours to beat --  that feels like it should only have been 20.   You'll find slightly more storytelling in the side quests which can be found in pubs and guild halls that each town sport. Well, you will in the pub quests. The guild hall side quests are simply tasks to complete and then come back and accept your reward. These range from killing a specific rare monster (which can be dauntingly difficult to find even when you know the area they are supposed to be in) to killing a certain number of one type of monster to collecting a number of items.  Pubs are where you can collect quests with more meat on them. These range from fighting tough enemies to simply talking to a few people and then returning to the quest giver. Like the rest of the game, these are sometimes disjointed. You never really know whether the quest will be too difficult for you at that point or a breeze and as soon as you accept the quest, it teleports you to the scene of the action. You might find yourself quickly wiped out or you might find something that can be completed in just a few minutes.   Only the main characters can use limit breaks, like this one. The rest of the characters are useless filler. Outside of the pubs and guild halls, each town only offers a few shops and maybe one or two buildings to enter. There really is not much to do within city limits.  All told, The Last Remnant feels unfinished. The musical score is quite good, but the voice acting comes in limited amounts. Where you do get voicework, sometimes it is nonsensical. Why does one character yell, \"What the hell?\" when he attacks? Is he surprised to be swinging an axe at a monster? The graphics are also a mixed bag. Some areas of the game have wonderful backgrounds that look fantastic. Others are empty fields or hallways with little detail. Some of the monsters have a great design. Then you'll find that your squad will be filled out with identical copies of character models, making it tough to distinguish who is who on the fly. "

They dazzled me with their open world design, which felt like the answer to years of fan requests \u2013 but the performance and aesthetic hits that came with that innovation were painful catches that didn\u2019t quite feel worth the trade. Still, with two DLCs on the horizon, I had hope that Game Freak would be able to pull it together. Could the first DLC, The Teal Mask, fix Scarlet and Violet\u2019s glaring issues and deliver a robust, new experience that fully embraced the clear potential of what these games could have been? Nope!!! For starters, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible, but somehow The Teal Mask runs worse than the base game of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet does. I complained about the poor performance of Scarlet and Violet in my initial review, and had hoped that a whole year later Game Freak would have made improvements to things like framerate, pop-in, weird lighting issues, model clipping, and everything else \u2013 problems Nintendo even stated it was working to address back in December. But it hasn\u2019t. Instead, it feels like the DLC has the jankiness turned up about one or two more notches. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It\u2019s still playable: I didn\u2019t run into any game breaking bugs. I did suffer from one hard crash, which while not a huge deal due to the game's frequent autosave, is still pretty shocking given the franchise's relatively polished history. But more importantly, during my playthrough of The Teal Mask it was impossible to go for more than a minute or two without a visual distraction. Maybe my Tinkaton was clipping through the ground during battle, or falling into the abyss when an encounter started on a cliffside. Maybe I was watching nearby Pokemon models vibrate violently, or seeing NPCs vanish in and out of existence. Or maybe the whole thing was just chugging, simply because I was riding on my Miraidon and it didn\u2019t know how to handle more than a few trees appearing on screen at once. Look, I don\u2019t expect high-fidelity graphics at the level of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in my Pokemon games. But the sheer amount of issues is so distracting all the time that it became an active detriment to my enjoyment. And if Game Freak keeps up its current pace of making performance several degrees worse with each game, by the next gen or so Pokemon might be literally unplayable, because you won\u2019t be able to see anything. Fingers crossed that The Indigo Disk DLC this Winter improves matters literally at all.

I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined \u2013 a belief I also held about Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts \u2013 visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness \u2013 are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pok\u00e9mon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pok\u00e9mon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pok\u00e9mon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you\u2019re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we\u2019ve all come to expect has not been shown here. \u2013 Rebekah Valentine, November 23, 2022 Score: 6 Read the full Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review. I don\u2019t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid battles from the original review still haven\u2019t been fixed, which tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet refreshes its available raids and doesn\u2019t notify you when they\u2019re full. And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn, freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what\u2019s going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without running into this stuff and being frustrated by it. Kitakami feels like a massive letdown. \u201c My feelings about the new Kitakami island region itself aren\u2019t much fonder. Like Paldea, the world of Scarlet and Violet\u2019s DLC is butt-ugly, with low-res textures, little detail in its environments, and a single town mostly made up of buildings you can\u2019t enter and NPCs uttering boring, nothing phrases. That big local \u201cfestival\u201d that the trailers hyped up? It\u2019s just a few carts with vendors and some uninteresting NPCs. It\u2019s even more of a disappointment when you consider that Kitakami is based on Japan \u2013 a nation that Game Freak has based multiple memorable regions off of before (Kanto and Johto). When I\u2019ve already seen a Japanese-inspired world done in such loving detail in multiple Pokemon Games, Kitakami feels like a massive letdown. Which new Pokemon are you most excited to add to your team in The Teal Mask? Dipplin Poltchageist/Sinistcha Ogerpon Bloodmoon Ursaluna Okidogi Munkidori Fezandipiti Answer See Results That said, The Teal Mask isn\u2019t all bad. The battling and competitive aspects are still what they\u2019ve always been (good), and it\u2019s still fun to fill up a PC box full of neat little dudes you find running around outside. The island checks all the boxes for that activity specifically: it\u2019s big, full of Pokemon, and has lots of different biomes to poke around in. One of my favorite parts of Kitakami was the mountain at its center with crystalline pools at the summit, numerous caves along its path to the top, and a surprising cavern structure within full of Pokemon hiding around corners and in little holes. But the overall ugliness and performance issues did detract from locations that looked like they were probably quite beautiful in their concept art, just not their final execution \u2013 such as when I first laid eyes on those sparkling pools on the mountaintop, or when I crossed a thin, stone bridge to a mysterious cave as the sunset hit the surrounding rock formations. The plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming. \u201c Content-wise, The Teal Mask largely consists of a familiar Pokemon formula where you track down a legendary Pokemon while learning about local lore. You\u2019re accompanied on this quest by a sibling pair, Carmine and Kieran, both of whom spent most of the story alternating between yelling at me over nothing and challenging me to battles. The Teal Mask\u2019s plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming, which is a pretty big bummer after the heights reached during the ending of Scarlet and Violet. This DLC campaign is also short, about seven or eight hours long, though catching every newly-added monster will stretch it a bit more. Rebekah's Favorite Pokemon Games All my favorite Pokemon games from over the years! In no particular order.

After hours of Carmine and Kieran shouting at me, Perrin\u2019s curiosity and backstory with photography were a refreshing change, and her photo-taking minigame provided a natural avenue for The Teal Mask to expand on something I loved in Scarlet and Violet: discovering Pokemon doing fun Pokemon things in their habitats. Frankly, Perrin\u2019s story is so much more interesting than the rest of the DLC that it\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t spend more time hanging out with her and her Hisuian Growlithe instead of being dragged around by the world\u2019s most unnecessarily angsty preteens. Ogre Oustin\u2019 is boring, repetitive, and runs terribly (especially online). \u201c Other new features in The Teal Mask include an expanded Pokedex with a tiny handful of new monsters, a middling selection of new cosmetic choices, and a terrible minigame called \u201cOgre Oustin\u2019\u201d that involves tanking your framerate further by speeding around on your bike to collect berries really fast. While I\u2019m always happy to praise Game Freak\u2019s Pokemon designs (especially the candy apple-themed Dipplin \u2013 cute!), and it\u2019s nice to finally change out of my hideous school uniform, I don\u2019t know what they were thinking with Ogre Oustin\u2019. It\u2019s boring, repetitive, runs terribly (especially online), and yet made me feel bad about not wanting to play it by offering great rewards for anyone looking to build raiding or competitive teams. Terrible. Every IGN Pokemon Review Ever 56 Images The ways in which The Teal Mask feels like a step backward from what made Scarlet and Violet astonishing are also disappointing. Scarlet and Violet themselves promoted player freedom: you could go anywhere you wanted at almost any time, and do the major plot points in any order. The Teal Mask mysteriously tosses that in the bin in favor of a far more standard, linear journey. While you can explore any part of the island at any time, there\u2019s no benefit to doing so beyond catching Pokemon. You can\u2019t even do the initial quest \u2013 which involves visiting three sign boards around the island \u2013 in any order. The sudden loss of that player freedom is painful given how critical it was to my enjoyment of the base game. It\u2019s also a surprisingly weak effort when compared to Game Freak\u2019s previous DLC attempts in Pokemon Sword and Shield\u2019s Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra. While both of these DLC were similarly criticized for being shallow in the story department, Isle of Armor added challenge by forcing you to train a brand new Pokemon, while Crown Tundra included multiple new game modes. The Teal Mask does\u2026 none of that, and feels distinctly incomplete. Maybe that\u2019s because it was always meant to be just one half of a package with The Indigo Mask, but if that\u2019s the case, then I question the wisdom of splitting the DLC at all."

        "Content": "Mario Kart 8 is a beautiful, fun kart racer that introduces sound new ideas to Nintendo\u2019s 22-year old franchise. While it doesn't reach Double Dash-levels of risk and experimentation, Mario Kart 8 builds on the series' most essential aspects better than any of its predecessors. Twisting U-turns, a blistering sense of speed, skillful track designs , robust tournament and online features, and gorgeous graphics fall into lockstep all at once. The end result shouldn't come as a surprise: Mario Kart 8 is the king of the mascot kart circuit, and it gave me hours of enjoyment. Right from the starting line, Nintendo\u2019s emphasis on re-tuning Mario Kart 8 in a meaningful way is apparent, and everything moves at a faster pace. Characters and vehicle customization parts unlock quickly, Lakitu helps you recover faster, and new items like the Piranha Plant and Boomerang Flower make for useful additions without throwing off Mario Kart\u2019s delicate balance. And finally, Blue Shell -haters rejoice: the new Super Horn stops the much-maligned comeback mechanic dead in its tracks, allowing skill to prevail more often than ever before. The single best improvement in Mario Kart 8 are the subtle, yet ultimately satisfying antigravity transformations. They set up visually impressive moments while introducing a unique new mechanic to the race. Bumping nearby racers while in anti-grav can give your opponent a speed boost though , so you have to consider the best potential angle to slam into them so that you\u2019re the only one who benefits. Nailing a perfect bump after a tricky S-curve delivered a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. It\u2019s surprising to see such a potentially chaotic idea turned into a nuanced mechanic. Mario Kart 8\u2019s creative track designs carefully factor antigravity in without overusing it. Some tracks, like Wario Stadium , use it to great effect, but retro tracks like Donut Plains 3 rely on good old-fashioned kart racing skills. The careful layout of boost pads and item boxes provide plenty of opportunities to make comebacks without it feeling cheap or unearned. The deceptively simple shortcuts often felt risky, making me weigh my options mid-race depending on how I was doing rather than blindly jumping into the alternate routes ahead. The roster tops off at 30 characters , and offers a wide selection of mascots to choose from, including the amazing Koopa kids. However, the overload of babies in this installment floods the roster with smaller racers that feel too similar to their big brother (or sister) counterparts. Overall, the list is great but more obscure characters like Dry Bones or Nabbit would\u2019ve been welcome additions. Mario Kart 8 offers a bunch of options to play. Single and two-player split-screen races unfolded at a stunning 60 frames-per-second without a hiccup. Three and four-player local competitive races halved the framerate to 30 fps, but it\u2019s an acceptable loss when the racing looks and plays this well. Mario Kart 8's graphics are some of the best I've seen in a game made by Nintendo.  Each racer, kart combination, and track showcased expert art direction right down to the tiny treads on the tires. Online mode supports up to 12-players, and Nintendo gets a lot of mileage out of Mario Kart 8\u2019s basic online features. It\u2019s easy to join races, setup tournaments, and even upload highlight videos to YouTube, but once again, Nintendo\u2019s den mother attitude rears its head: Chat is restricted to lobbies with friends only. There\u2019s no option to invite friends into a game, and Mario Kart 8 also doesn't provide message notifications. This is seriously disappointing because you have to use outside means to coordinate friends-only races. These omissions often make Mario Kart 8 feel like a fancy import Ferrari with an old ham radio built into the dashboard. There\u2019s a few other small disappointments in Mario Kart 8 as well. The GamePad always mirrors what\u2019s on the television instead of splitting players into two separately rendered screens. Battle Mode probably suffers the most egregiously of all though. The arenas from previous versions are out, and the newly modified racetracks Nintendo replaced them with don\u2019t feel differentiated enough from the standard tracks. It basically just adds three balloons to standard races. Ultimately, these changes have made what used to be a fun distraction into something completely forgettable. For a racing game about constantly plowing forward to the finish line, I was surprised by how well Mario Kart 8 also nails the tiniest details. Mario Kart TV\u2019s simple editing suite let me tweak highlight reels, and re-watch my most memorable performances. As I watched clips in slow motion, I was amazed by how much texture detail I had missed while I was tearing up the track."

        "Content": "If you've ever caught yourself wondering if PS2 games still hold up, I suggest picking up a copy of Onimusha: Warlords. For all intents and purposes, it's exactly the same as it was when it first released in 2001, but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing in 2019. Onimusha: Warlords is a classic take on the survival horror genre, set in feudal Japan. Think Resident Evil, but instead of zombies and biological horrors, you battle demons and undead abominations from Japanese mythology.  It's not without updates, but they're minor additions to a game I really enjoyed 18 long years ago. The most notable addition to Onimusha: Warlords are its new, HD graphics. But they're not \"new,\" like you would find in a full-in remaster like Capcom's gorgeous upcoming Resident Evil 2 remake. The graphics are wrapped in shiny new high-resolution textures, but are otherwise the same as they were in 2001, and boy oh boy do they look it.   Those 2001 pre-rendered backgrounds and low-polygon count character models look absolutely primitive by today's standards. There are games running on your phone that look better. If anything, freshening up the textures without bringing anything else into the modern era really brings out the creakiness of the PS2-era graphics.  One of the most glaring old-school quirks in Onimusha: Warlords are its unskippable cutscenes. \u201c The pre-rendered backgrounds, the hallmark of PS1 and PS2-era survival horror, look muddy and primitive when the light of high-definition shines upon them. I played through Onimusha on Nintendo Switch, and even on the small screen in handheld mode, the backgrounds looked tired and hopelessly dated.  Character animations are stiff, and faces have an unnatural plastic smoothness to them. Their fingers don't move at all, stuck in a permanent, almost Ken-doll-like half open pose during cutscenes. There's a weird twitch to them, too, when they're supposed to be otherwise motionless.  The pre-rendered cutscenes were a real treat in 2001, but in 2019, they look their age. I remember seeing them on my PS2 and being blown away by what was then high-quality CGI video. Now it just looks bad.  A Different Era  Speaking of which, one of the most glaring old-school quirks in Onimusha: Warlords are its unskippable cutscenes. You can't even skip through dialogue. Instead, you are required to watch everything unfold. It's incredibly frustrating when you lose to a boss, or otherwise die, and have to sit through the same cutscene again.   Death is another part of Onimusha where its aged mechanics are front and center. There's no modern save system here, so you must find a magic mirror to mark your progress. I found it really irritating, especially since boss fights don't have save points near them. Dying against a boss means not only do you have to rewatch an unskippable cutscene, but you also have to retrace your steps through the castle between the last save point and the boss fight. For all its dusty gameplay mechanics and frustrating old-school backtracking, I still found myself enjoying playing through Onimusha. \u201c  Like many other turn-of-the-century survival horror games, you spend roughly 50% of your time fighting enemies, and 50% running around to find an item to fit in a lock so you can open the next part of the game. There's a lot of back and forth here. Since the backgrounds are stationary and prerendered, as was the style at the time, I had a hard time getting a sense of direction. I'd run around a corner and suddenly be facing the opposite way. I couldn't get my bearings, and the primitive map system barely helps. On my next playthrough, I'm sure I'll be able to breeze through thanks to a newfound sense of familiarity, but on my first time in nearly two decades, I spent a sizeable chunk of time running back and forth, trying to remember where it was I saw a door requiring some manner of medallion or key.  For all its dusty gameplay mechanics and frustrating old-school backtracking, I still found myself enjoying playing through Onimusha. I definitely swore more than once after dying and needing to suffer through a cutscene again, but there's something quaint about its aged pre-rendered backgrounds and choppy character animations. It's more than a game set in another era, it's a game from another era. Frustrations aside, there's still fun to be had.   The Dark Realm sidequest remains one of my favorite in gaming, and I was more than happy to revisit it on Nintendo Switch. The reward for making it through the rush mode is just too fantastic to ignore, and being able to try (and try again) in handheld mode makes it a fun, mindless time waster with a fantastic, almost game-breaking, reward.  Collecting souls to upgrade weapons gets a touch grindy, but playing on Switch, I didn't mind so much. Grinding souls is a nice way to waste some time in handheld, but I don't imagine it's nearly as fun on a non-handheld system like Xbox One or PS4. After all your weapons and orbs are maxed out, which took me about 3 \u00bd hours of the 5-6 hour campaign, you only need to collect souls to recharge your magic and life, which takes the edge off a little."

        "Title": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy Review",
        "Subtitle": "Oh Sammy boy, you deserve better...",
        "Content": "Hankering for a stealth-action franchise but not in the mood to hear two people grouse about existentialism on the back of a snowmobile? Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is arguably your best option. Laden with real-world, high-tech gadgetry and \"it could happen\" global conflicts setting the stage, Splinter Cell has carved out its own path in the genre, admirably competing neck and snapped neck with Solid Snake's exploits.   Those are some strong legs.   Ubisoft has rereleased the first three games in the series with an HD upgrade in the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Trilogy for PlayStation 3. The trilogy is available both as a retail package that offers all three games on one Blu-ray disc or as a downloadable PSN bundle, both with added support for trophies.  Instead of focusing on each individual game in the franchise, this review will deal with the collection as a whole, what it offers to fans of the series, and most importantly, what it doesn't.  As soon as you pop the disc in your system, you must perform a mandatory 5.5 GB install onto your hard drive. Sit tight, grab an icy cold beverage and surf IGN; this will take around twenty minutes or so.  The HD presentations of each game make up the real meat and potatoes of the Trilogy's updates. All three games are presented in 1080p (although Chaos Theory does require some XMB finagling to get it to display in 1080p instead of 720p).  Unfortunately, aside from simply upping the resolution, the conversion team didn't do much to update the games at all. The first Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow haven't aged very well, and what were once phenomenal lighting effects appear pretty poor by today's standards. While that may be forgivable at the onset, the framerate stutters consistently throughout the first two games. All in all, it doesn't look like anyone cared to add extra oomph to the visual presentation.  While the original game and Pandora Tomorrow look like a murky, choppy mess, Chaos Theory actually looks pretty good. The framerate remains solid in this port, and the lighting effects still hold up, making this the technical standout of the pack.   Stop choking yourself. Stop choking yourself.  However, even though Chaos Theory is far and away the best of the bunch graphically, the game commits a fatal sin \u2013 the complete lack of multiplayer. Same goes for Pandora Tomorrow, which originally offered up a competitive multiplayer mode that pitted stealth players against well-armed mercenaries, while Chaos Theory featured a spin on the aforementioned mode as well as a set of great co-op stealth missions. Tragically, neither game offers what made them so unique in the first place.  In place of a really compelling multiplayer element, we get 3D support. While the effect looks cool at times (notably when you have your night-vision goggles activated), the framerate takes even more of a dive when activated. Any benefits that 3D may offer become negated when the on-screen action gets too jittery, so even if you have the setup to take advantage of this added perk, I suspect most players will turn it off before too long.",

        "Content": "The new benchmark for interactive entertainment has arrived. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , the fifth official installment in Nintendo's popular action adventure series is finally here, and like its NES predecessor in 1987 it is a game so enjoyable, it has the power to pull videogame players into its imaginative worlds -- and refuse to let go for days. Call us crazy, but when the final version of Zelda 64 arrived in the IGN64 offices, we stopped working, locked ourselves into a room with a big-screen TV and a surround system and played 17 hours straight. After only a few hours of sleep, we were back for more and we couldn't stop until we finished the game. Then, we started over again to find all the secrets. Rarely is there such a perfect mixture of graphics, sound, and gameplay that even the most cynical players will admit that Zelda 64 is poised to shape the action RPG genre for years to come.  Gameplay Like all games in the Zelda series, Ocarina of Time follows the adventures of a young boy named Link. After a nightmare involving a certain young princess and the evil thief Ganondorf (who eventually turns into the horned creature known as Ganon), the elven boy wakes up in his home village tucked away behind the mysterious Lost Woods. The only Kokiri without a fairy, Link soon meets up with his new traveling companion, the winged Navi, and sets out on the adventure of his life. The quest, which inevitably turns into a rescue mission for Princess Zelda, leads players through dark dungeons, picturesque villages, into the heart of a volcano, to the bottom of a lake, through a haunted desert, deep into a magical forest, into a giant tree, the belly of a beast, and even through time. To say that this game is huge is an understatement. Every time you discover a new corner of the Kingdom of Hyrule, you'll be amazed at the detail, the richness of scenery, the many things to do, and the amount of thought that went into designing it all. For example, players can spend hours just exploring a village, talking to the inhabitants, solving puzzles, and looking for hidden items. As soon as you pick up the controls for the first time and start to explore the vast universe that makes up this latest creation from the hands of Shigeru Miyamoto and team, you know you're in for a treat. At first, the control is very reminiscent of Super Mario 64 , the game that single-handedly invented 3D platformers as we know them. But Ocarina of Time is not a platformer, a fact that takes some getting used to when trying out Link's various actions. There is no jump button. You can still jump at certain points in the game, but it is not integral to the gameplay that players actually control the jump themselves. Instead, Ocarina of Time introduces an auto-jump feature where Link will jump the last possible moment when running toward a ledge. It sounds annoying in theory, but it works very well for this type of game. The gameplay objectives will be instantly familiar to friends of the series. Push walls to find hidden rooms, use bombs to uncover secret passages, shoot arrows at certain objects to open doors, and so on. But Ocarina of Time doesn't only imitate its predecessors, it innovates at every corner. With the use of the ocarina (a clay flute), players need to play certain melodies to solve riddles or warp to new places, and even engage in numerous games of \"Simon Says\". When you bring out the ocarina, the controller's button layout actually mirrors a real ocarina, with the Z button acting as the bottom hole on the flute. To allow for a little more fun, the designers also added a pitch bend and modulation option via the analog stick. Compare Zelda 64 to other titles and you will find that even one single dungeon has more puzzles than all the levels in many other games combined. Things really take off once Ocarina of Time introduces the ability to travel back and forth in time (very much like light world/dark world gameplay). Without giving too much away, consider this one: at one point in the game, you talk to a character as adolescent Link, who tells you that a young boy with an ocarina did something seven years ago. Then you go back in time and actually do it. Or how about a fully functional fishing game, with Rumble Pak support and realistic fish behavior? This mini-game is so good, any other company would have released it as a game of its own. Then there is the ability to ride a horse -- it's so addictive, you'll catch yourself just galloping around and jumping fences. Or how about involving sword fights with a multitude of enemies that block your attacks with their shields? A shooting gallery? A super-cool hookshot that lets you traverse deep ravines? Secrets involving the use of sunlight and mirrors? Want to light some torches? How about catching the spirit of a slain ghost in a bottle? Changing daylight and weather conditions that affect the gameplay? The ability to wear different masks? Rumble Pak vibrations that give away the locations of hidden caves? It's all there. Oh, and let's not forget about teasing chickens... No matter which way you look at it, Ocarina of Time is simply unmatched when it comes to the variety and diversity of actions and puzzles. Do yourself a favor and play this game without the use of a guide! It's a lot more rewarding when you finally get your hands on something that you've been looking for for days than to read about it in a guide. The camera follows Link in a style similar to Mario 64. Like in Mario, the camera also zooms out to reveal Link's surroundings at times -- but that's where the similarities end. In order to give players more control over the viewpoint and enable better, more focused 3D fighting, Nintendo reached deep into its bag of tricks and came up with an innovative feature. First of all, tapping the Z button will force the camera behind Link, no matter where you are. Incredibly, clipping is kept to a minimum and the camera logic almost always guarantees a good view of the action. But there is more. When you see a character or an object that interests you or you're being attacked by an enemy, press the Z trigger. This will bring up a rotating yellow cursor that locks onto your target. Now, as long as you don't press the Z button again (or turn away to break your lock), the camera will stay on your target, retaining its over the shoulder position. This allows you to circle your enemies and slash at them while side-stepping, back-flipping and shielding yourself from the onslaught. While you are locking on to a target, the screen will become slightly letterboxed to let you know that the target mode is active. To additionally help you keep track of your attackers, your fairy Navi will hover over the target's head. There is also an alternate camera setting that requires you to hold down the Z button to keep a lock, but your fingers will probably get tired after a while. Needless to say that the Z button feature works impressively well and is sure to find its way into future 3D games. Ingenious. The upper C button will let you either switch to an alternate camera angle (inside houses or towns), or zooms in to let you look around. The attack system is equally impressive. Pressing B will make Link draw his sword. Press it again to slash at your enemy once. Press it three times to swing the blade from the bottom to the top. Press forward and B to slash downward. Turn the 3D Stick in a circle to do a roundhouse slash. And once you found the proper \"power-up\", press and hold B to charge your sword and make it glow, then unleash a nice helicopter slash that's sure to turn any stinking skeleton into a heap of bones. Similar controls are available for the other items, which can be distributed over any of the lower three C buttons. Press the corresponding key once to draw the weapon or item, then press it again to attack. For the projectile weapons (such as the bow or the boomerang), the designers also added an optional first-person perspective, kind of like the sniper mode in GoldenEye . But the crowning feature is the context sensitive A button. If you stand close to a ladder, the A button display at the top of the screen will change to climb or descend, if you run around freely, it will change to jump, stand next to a sign and it turns into read, and so on. Simply pressing the button will activate the function. Some of the available functions include open, pull, push, dive, check, talk and crawl. This A button feature is Nintendo's way to keep things simple and to deal with the limited selection of buttons on a standard console controller. Once in a while, the automatic selection will cause you to do something you weren't trying to, but 99% of the time it works perfectly fine. Once you get used to the radically different camera system and button control, navigating the environments and fighting against enemies becomes second nature. Many of the problems that plagued Mario 64 in the camera and control department are a thing of the past, and there is virtually nothing that distracts from Zelda 64's immersive gameplay. Being able to explore the wide environments, climb hills, fight monsters, pick up and use items and discover new areas becomes second nature fairly quickly and soon you will feel right at home Hyrule. Add to that an interesting quest, tons of mini-games, hidden items (how about a two-fisted sword that doesn't break?) and enemies (100 hidden spiders, anyone?) and a compelling storyline with plenty of time travelling. Sure, you can probably blast through the title in around 30 hours, but it's easy to see why some gamers are spending in excess of 80 hours to complete the title. There is absolutely no question about it. Ocarina of Time is the best game on the N64 and we can't think of any game that we'd rather play on any other system.  Data Management The Zelda 64 cartridge, which is also available in a limited gold edition, comes with a built-in EEPROM that lets you save three different files on the cart. There is no need for a separate memory pak.  Graphics Remember how impressive it was when you jumped around in the 3D environments of Super Mario 64 for the first time back in 1996? With Zelda 64, Nintendo is raising the stakes considerably. Once you step into the Hyrule fields, blinded by the early morning sun, you will be mesmerized by the incredible scale and depth of the landscapes. Rolling hills extend all the way to the far horizon, with Hyrule Castle barely visible in the hazy distance. After a few minutes, the sun will set, it will get dark, and the moon slowly rises in the sky. Far, far away, a wolf howls and skeletons with red glowing eyes ascend from the earth. The graphics are incredible. Whereas Nintendo concentrated on framerate and speed with F-Zero X , Zelda 64 is all about detail and visibility. There is no fog. The towns are highly detailed with elaborate wall textures that are directly affected by Link's glowing fairy, Navi, and the beautiful day/night changes. Characters animate fluidly and display several different expressions on their faces. While the framerate and texture design is not always up to par with Rare's Banjo-Kazooie (the blurry marketplace scene comes to mind), the polygonal environments, colors, and visibility are the best yet seen on the system. In addition to the many wonderfully designed enemy characters roaming the dungeons and levels, Zelda 64 also pushes the limits of the console with oversized bosses. If you heard a loud thud on Monday, November 23, then it was our jaws hitting the floor when we first laid eyes on Ganon. Stick with this title and you will see temples and dungeons that seem to have jumped right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Add to that minutes of real-time rendered cutscenes that shape the story and you have one of the best looking console games ever made.  Sound Koji Kondo returns to deliver a whole songbook full of marvelous melodies. Some of the eerie dungeon tunes recall the work of minimalist composer Phillip Glass, others are vintage Kondo with sweeping string sounds and melancholic guitar picks. Unfortunately, there are a few stinkers with annoyingly dated synth samples (it's time to update your libraries, Nintendo!) and the legendary Zelda Overworld theme is NOT in the game. Boo! Luckily, there are plenty of returning melodies, such as the Adagio in Kakariko town and familiar ocarina tunes. But what really makes this game are the sound effects. Every location has a multitude of ambient noises, from the clanking of a windmill, the subtle trickling of water to the howling of the wind. The sound effects are brilliant. Depending on what you hit with your sword, you hear a cool metal clank, the bow and arrow are as convincing as the real thing, and the screams of the Dodongo are downright scary. The overworld is alive with bird calls, chirping crickets, animal noises and footsteps. In certain locations, thunder can be heard and it will start to rain -- and here's the kicker: the game is in full surround sound. Zelda is probably the first in-house developed Nintendo title that makes examplary use of the rear audio channel in addition to the L and R stereo channels. The sound virtually engulfs the player, drawing you completely into the world of Hyrule. A world, that players will be so content to live in while the game lasts that we can't put it any other way -- Zelda succeeds on every level. Flawless victory."

        "Content": "Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn\u2019t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It\u2019s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.  Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare\u2019s best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S. The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten \u2013 not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It\u2019s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.  Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you\u2019ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and \u2013 in the case of the space and water missions \u2013 special consideration for verticality and physics. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation\u2019s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.  But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It\u2019s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.  It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling \u2014 it's more about dumb fun \u2014 and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he\u2019s a member of the Ghosts. And then there\u2019s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.  The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.  Or, in the case of those for whom multiplayer is the primary focus, it handily gets out of the way other than to serve as the inspiration for map environments, equipment, and weapon design.  Ghosts preserves much of the look and feel of the traditional Call of Duty multiplayer experience, but introduces sweeping changes that make it more personalized, more diverse, and better balanced. At its core lies the expansive new Create a Soldier system, which affords us the ability to create and customize 10 unique characters, each with up to six loadouts, for a total of 60 available classes and 20,000 possible configurations. Create a Soldier also riffs on Black Ops II\u2019s Pick 10 system, allowing you to forego certain equipment in order to outfit a primary weapon with extra attachments or enable extra perks. In all, there are an impressive 39 weapons, 12 pieces of equipment, 35 new perks, 36 scorestreaks spanning three categories, and various weapons attachments to choose from.  Create a Solider is ambitious in its scope, and the sheer breadth of options caters to and empowers every style of play. Whether you want to run around like a high-powered knife-wielding mutant or move stealthily through a map by using heightened senses, you can. But for all of its versatility, Create a Soldier is dauntingly complex next to previous Call of Duty games. Even after hours of matches and experimentation, I felt as though I had only begun to understand the nuances of each of the 35 unique perks and how to optimize my classes for a specific style of play. On the one hand, Create a Soldier\u2019s depth will have enthusiast players honing their perfect loadouts for months, but on the other, it makes for a more challenging entry-level experience.  It's a credit to developer Infinity Ward that even while running around with a maxed-out weapon and the best complimentary perks I could find, at no point did I see a player gain a noticeable advantage. Unlike Black Ops II, which favors lightweight SMGs, Ghosts\u2019 balance encourages you to explore a variety of weapon types. SMGs are considerably less effective, while assault rifles are faster to shoulder and have a reduced impact on speed. A new class of weapons, called marksman rifles, bridges the gap between sniper rifles and assault rifles, providing range and power with greater mobility. Sniper rifles remain largely unaltered with two notable exceptions: new optics that preserve (but blur) your peripheral vision, and aim-assist has been reduced to make obnoxious quick-scoping harder to exploit.  The added emphasis on ranged weapons is paired with considerably larger maps, which greatly outnumber those that feature more traditional tight-quarters designs in the 15 included battlefields. In deathmatch-style gametypes, teams will often find themselves spread across smaller contingents at different sides of the map, whereas objective modes will draw everybody to certain points. Instead of just funneling players toward enemies via a limited number of paths, Ghosts presents an array of alternative routes, making team play far more effective than traditional run-and-gun strategy \u2013 in fact, running around these large maps gets lonely and boring. Traditional lone wolf-style play also throws a wrench in the spawn system, making enemies often appear nearby without warning. Playing in a well-coordinated group is more gratifying than ever, but more casual solo games can be frustrating.  There\u2019s also the much-touted map dynamicism, which disrupts pathways and sightlines using everything from player-triggered gates to a missile strike that turns the environment to a smoldering wasteland. The effect is less impactful and cinematic than Battlefield 4\u2019s crumbling buildings and dams, but with considerably smaller maps and faster-paced gameplay, grander scale or frequency would have been distracting. Instead, the traps and map events are only brief interruptions that can shake things up if one team becomes entrenched, but won\u2019t fundamentally alter the course of a game.  Ghosts multiplayer introduces five brand-new gametypes alongside all of the series staples like Domination and Kill Confirmed, for a total of 13 different modes. Although many of the new modes expand upon existing gametypes, each adds a fresh dynamic. My favorite new addition, Grind, is like Kill Confirmed, except that it requires you to not only collect dog tags from downed enemies, but also deposit them in one of two \u201cbanks\u201d on the map before being killed yourself. Another, Cranked, is like Team Deathmatch, but whenever you score a kill, you\u2019re given a 30 seconds to rack up another kill \u2013 or else you'll explode. Although they\u2019re simple modifiers, the new gametypes are immensely fun and breathe new life into multiplayer.  Extinction, Ghosts\u2019 new alien invasion mode, is better compared to Valve's Left 4 Dead games than Treyarch\u2019s zombie modes from Black Ops. It's a four-player cooperative mode wherein you fight off monstrous creatures through a miniature campaign set in a large, multi-stage level. Unlike zombies, the aliens are nimble and unpredictable, leaping over objects and scaling walls. It's a tough challenge, and teams must carefully consider their loadouts, special abilities, equipment, and power-up trees to ensure survival, making for an interesting strategic dynamic.  For a more traditional Call of Duty experience, but sheltered from the fierce competitive landscape of multiplayer, there\u2019s Squads: a suite of cooperative modes that offers wave defense (AKA horde mode) and competitive bot matches. In a cool touch, Squads uses your custom characters and classes as the basis for A.I. soldiers that play alongside you to battle other bots or human players. Bot matches are hardly novel for the genre, but the soldiers in Squads are especially notable because of how easy it is to mistake them for human players due to their use of advanced tactics. It's impressive how they move through maps aggressively, and appear to be acutely aware of other players.  Squads is an excellent testing ground, and offers a nice respite from online multiplayer while also contributing to online character progression using the unified Create a Soldier system. Most importantly, the new Call of Duty profile system allows players to carry over their stats, unlocks, and characters created for Squads or multiplayer across generations. If you play on Xbox 360 and visit a friend who owns a Xbox One, your character and all progression is carried over, and comes back home with you.  This is possible, in part, because of cross-generation, cross-platform feature parity. Character customization, maps, dynamic events, weapons, gametypes, and constant 60fps multiplayer framerates are ubiquitous across current- and next-gen platforms. The biggest variations between platforms falls upon visuals and player counts. On the current-gen versions Ghosts looks nearly identical, though I did encounter occasional framerate issues during the single-player campaign on PS3 and PS4, whereas my time with the Xbox One version was stable throughout.  Like Black Ops II, the Wii U version takes advantage of the gamepad to present a secondary display for the in-game map and provide touchscreen shortcuts to custom loadouts. The gamepad\u2019s display can also be used to play without a TV, though it also supports Wii Remotes and the controller. Graphically, the Wii U version is comparable to Xbox 360 and PS3, and overall, runs smoothly. Unsurprisingly, the PC version scales well from low- to high-end machines, and in most cases, looks superior to the next-gen experience.  It\u2019s difficult to appreciate the variation between current-gen and next-gen in TV commercials or a browser window, but up close and personal, the difference is drastic. Whereas the current-gen versions look muddy with blotchy textures, characters, weapon models, and environments are presented in vivid detail on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Call of Duty engine fares surprisingly well on next-gen, but even then Ghosts lacks a lot of the added atmospheric effects and visual panache that makes competing games look so realistic. I\u2019m eager to see what a future Call of Duty looks like when maintaining 60 frames-per-second on current-gen is no longer a concern.  When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there\u2019s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality.  It\u2019s certainly going to be a sticking point for those who demand the highest fidelity experience, but the difference is harder to identify in absence of a side-by-side comparison.  Oddly, the Xbox One version makes no use of the haptic feedback motors built into the controller\u2019s triggers, and the DualShock 4\u2019s trackpad is used solely as a button to toggle the in-game scoreboard during multiplayer.  There is, however, one notable exclusion from current-gen. Historically, Call of Duty has limited a majority of its modes to 12 players, but offered an additional playlist that supports 18-player matches known as Ground War. While the larger-scale matches live on with the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, owners of the Xbox 360, Wii U, and PS3 versions are capped at 12 players. It\u2019s a surprising step back for the series, and the larger maps could have benefited from the higher player count.  It should also be noted that my smooth multiplayer experience was hosted on a dedicated server hosted by Activision \u2013 and most of yours will be, too. Activision says that all platforms will use a hybrid of dedicated servers and peer-to-peer matchmaking, which should eliminate many of the lag issues we've seen in the past. If all goes well, the days of being tossed into a game hosted by someone 2,000 miles away on a dial-up connection will be behind us."

The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War \u2013 its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined character, God of War\u2019s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions. It\u2019s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos\u2019 relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.  God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot. \u201c God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot. Kratos and Atreus \u2013 who start as, at best, acquaintances \u2013 begin their journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos\u2019 wife, whom Atreus bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes. The setup is Journey-like in its visual nature \u2013 I saw the peak in the distance and knew I\u2019d get there eventually \u2013 but as similar stories have taught me, the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours\u2019 worth of terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the opening hours. Every God of War Review 12 Images If you\u2019ve played the previous games in the series \u2013 seven of them, counting two PSP games and one mobile game \u2013 you know that Kratos lived a long life of loss, triumph, and plenty of god-killing in ancient Greece. While that history certainly informs who he is now, the character we encounter here has started a new chapter, having found love, a family, and a full bushy beard in this world of Norse mythology. But he is still a stranger to this place, and is forced to rely on the son he barely connects with to decipher its languages and guide him when the swing of an axe or the imprint of his boot on an undead foe won\u2019t do the trick. That relationship, and how it evolves and changes over the course of the story, is one of God of War\u2019s most captivating qualities. Here are two people with demonstrably different personalities, one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked as they come, both grieving over the same woman in different ways. Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to him mostly as \u201cBoy,\u201d and rarely making eye or physical contact with him. (He will, of course, unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone who threatens his son, which appears to be the only way he knows how to express affection.) Kratos\u2019 uncertainty of how to relate to a boy he\u2019s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to watch. Sharp dialogue made me see myself in both Kratos and Atreus' shoes. \u201c Their dichotomy plays out in stirring, realistic moments throughout the story. I was surprised by how often I saw myself in both Kratos and Atreus\u2019 well-worn shoes. I\u2019ve told important people in my own life some of the very things they say to each other, and I\u2019ve thought (but been too afraid to speak aloud) many others, making God of War\u2019s relationships feel real and cuttingly honest. Other games have tackled parent-child relationships, but I can\u2019t remember a father-son dynamic so successfully developed and used to ground a fantastical adventure. This depth and complexity is something entirely new to Kratos, and this new God of War transforms him from the previous games\u2019 flat embodiment of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media. He\u2019s now voiced by Stargate SG-1\u2019s thunderous baritone Christopher Judge, who can say so much with a single word or grunt. He gives the long-running character\u2019s stoic dialogue both an intimidating gravitas and nuance you can hear as he grapples with the needs of his son, his internal fears and pain and, of course, the elements and monsters trying to stop him from reaching his goal. You\u2019re Still Young, That\u2019s Your Fault God of War\u2019s single-camera shot style that, unless you die, never cuts once from title screen to ending credits \u2013 is a subtle effect that didn\u2019t really strike me at first. But as I explored and fought my way through the story, it served to highlight the power of some of the larger-scale monsters. By never leaving Kratos\u2019 side, I maintained the perspective needed to instantly convey the intensity of taking on a foe 10 times his size. And fear not, God of War still delivers the franchise\u2019s trademark variety of awe-inspiring locations, and the camera helps them shine through in the story\u2019s quietest moments. At some of the most tense and heartbreaking moments, the camera never leaves Kratos\u2019 mindstate. You\u2019re forced to sit with him \u2013 sometimes in silence, sometimes in anguish as a haunting choir echoes around him, and sometimes in relief \u2013 through every second of it. That intimacy makes those emotions all the more real and impactful. It\u2019s made Kratos relatable enough that I\u2019ve been caught audibly referring to Atreus as \u201cmy son\u201d several times since the opening hours. Atreus\u2019 impact cannot be understated \u2013 he\u2019s both an asset to the story and in battle. That\u2019s a huge relief because, historically, games that force you to stick with a sidekick of sorts for the entire experience have been hit or miss. Some, like The Last of Us, use that relationship to smart effect, with twists to the gameplay introduced late in the story. Others make those sidekicks a constant hassle \u2013 an extra life bar governed by a sometimes-suicidal AI to consistently worry about in the midst of battle. Atreus is more like the former. What\u2019s so smart about this central relationship, though, is how brilliantly God of War mirrors it onto gameplay from the start. Though the two were estranged, Atreus is still Kratos\u2019 son, and so he listens to your directions and behaves as an almost invulnerable extension of your own abilities in combat. Equipped with a bow and a bottomless quiver of arrows, Atreus will automatically plink away at enemies or jump on them to stun them, and he\u2019ll take a more powerful shot at whatever you\u2019re looking at when directed with a tap of the square button, creating a rhythm as you time taps to match his recharge rate and employ his attacks effectively. His skill tree can also be upgraded to follow up on Kratos\u2019 more powerful attacks. Yet God of War plays with the assumption that Atreus is always at your beck and call, and the weight of the changes in their relationship are cleverly woven into your battles. The Art of War And there are battles aplenty. Though Kratos only kills for survival now, he still does so with a flair for brutality. The stun-kill animations can be especially gory and literally bone-crunching affairs. (Though, because there\u2019s only one per enemy type, they become somewhat repetitive to watch.) While God of War is altogether more emotionally complex and layered, its excellent combat undoubtedly carries forward the blood-soaked traditions of the series. Kratos\u2019 signature weapon this time out is the Leviathan Axe, which is one of the best weapons I\u2019ve used in any recent game. It begins with a simple light and heavy attack but can be upgraded and given new abilities throughout your journey. It\u2019s a lot of fun to chop and slice through hordes of foes with, but I\u2019ve rarely enjoyed a weapon more than when the axe is flying through the air. The Leviathan Axe acts just like Thor's hammer, and it's So. Damn. Satisfying. \u201c Its best trick is that, when thrown, the Leviathan acts just like Thor\u2019s hammer, Mjlonir, as depicted in the Marvel movies. The axe will whip back into your hand with the tap of the triangle button, cutting any foes in its path, both coming and going. It\u2019s also imbued with a frost power that can freeze individual targets while it\u2019s lodged in them, letting you disable one while you beat on his friends with Kratos\u2019 almost-as-lethal fists. The feel of throwing and recalling the Leviathan Axe is So. Damn. Satisfying. The first time I learned I could do this, I sliced an enemy through the head and then proceeded to spend a good 10 minutes just chucking the axe and recalling it in the forest, noting and appreciating the slight difference in the time it takes to return from greater distances. The loud, reverberating thwang noise it makes, paired with a precise rumble in the controller, makes the return slam into Kratos\u2019 outstretched hand feel good even hundreds or thousands of throws later. Finding the right combination of slicing, throwing, assistance from Atreus, and parrying with Kratos\u2019 retractable shield turns each battle into a bloody ballet of timing \u2013 and that\u2019s before you begin unlocking special attacks, like a beam of ice shooting out from the axe or a Patronus-esque wolf Atreus can summon for battle. Though I quickly found my favorites, certain scenarios required me to vary up my abilities by mixing in enemies with immunities and weaknesses. I skipped out on some options in the early game, because options are limited by what you can afford to unlock with XP, but by the latter half I had more than enough to unlock pretty much everything I wanted in time for the most brutal battles. I felt encouraged to experiment.By the end, I\u2019d maxed out every skill tree, including Kratos\u2019 returning Rage of the Gods ability that gives you a temporary boost to damage via a flurry of flaming fists. But those upgrades didn\u2019t make battles a breeze \u2013 I still found challenge until the very end, and beyond in my post-game endeavors. A big variable in combat is Kratos and Atreus\u2019 armor. Chest, wrist, and waist pieces, as well as some tweaks to the axe, can alter a number of Kratos\u2019 stats, from strength and defense to runic magic and attack cooldown rates, and those can have a significant effect on the way you fight. I stayed with my tried-and-true animal hide chest guards rather than full breastplates, sacrificing defense over strength, but would take on new equipment \u2013 or outfit them with my amassed slottable runes \u2013 to imbue my gear with defenses against certain enemies or to accentuate abilities like my axe\u2019s frost power. I also may have made a few clothing choices based on look because, even though Kratos is no fashion icon, with such intricate character detail I wanted him to stay true to my vision of this embattled man. (And, largely, my Kratos would never wear bulky chest plates.) To the very end, I approached every battle with determination, adapting my fighting and fashion to the variety of enemies, which range from Kratos-sized to sometimes 10 times bigger. I encountered an ice enemy early on against whom my axe did no damage, forcing me to rely on my fists and Atreus\u2019 bow. And the gruesome revenant witch enemy required me to focus on stunning first, as they moved far too quickly for most of my axe hits to connect. That enemy diversity always made me feel like I was learning, up to and including my exploration of some of the optional areas. It seemed as though every time I worried enemy variety might be about to stagnate, a new type or variant would pop up to further complicate my journey. The big enemies put up a great fight, like a giant troll who swats at you with a huge club, but some of the best that come from human-sized foes offer a worthy challenge. Most notably, there are a couple of stellar boss fights that, while not terribly complex, do a fantastic job of showing off Kratos\u2019 god-level strength and conveying a feeling of power. A Whole New World God of War\u2019s initially linear world opens up a bit after the first few hours, and it encourages exploration through its many rewards and collectibles for completing optional puzzles and fights. But you can occasionally stumble into the path of a much more difficult opponent, clearly denoted by the purple color of their health bar, and they can often take you down in one or two hits. Running into these situations occasionally felt like intruding on someone or something else\u2019s territory, and I needed to be prepared. If I felt hungry for a challenge, God of War never let me down. There\u2019s plenty of freedom, although the map never becomes truly \u201copen world\u201d in the way that games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Horizon Zero Dawn are; instead, it\u2019s an interconnected series of diverse locations, many of which are gated behind certain story moments and collectible milestones until the very end. God of War\u2019s contained nature shepherds you through certain locations with its quest chain, which occasionally leans on the cliche of a solution Kratos thought would work turning out to be missing one key component you then need to then go scour the land for. But its world unfolds through smart integration with that story in a manner that occasionally transformed me into a cliche, too. I expected Kratos\u2019 journey to be relatively straightforward and somewhat contained to the area I was initially presented. But then you might stumble on a collectible that extends Kratos\u2019 journey far beyond expectations. Those moments \u2013 where I\u2019d find myself traveling further than I set out to and in a surprisingly expansive world, no less \u2013 had me literally leaping out of my chair. Some of that progress requires straying from the main path, as there are also several major, rewarding areas you can miss entirely if you don\u2019t take advantage of Atreus\u2019 many reminders that you can explore newly uncovered terrain. Both the optional areas and those key to the story not only make smart use of Norse figures and locations, but some are also reshaped throughout the story in ways that make repeat visits valuable and exciting. A variety of collectibles are scattered throughout the world that can earn you tangible rewards, like resources for crafting new armor or new special attacks, or simply offer new tidbits of Norse myth. Knowledge of the lore is its own reward in God of War. \u201c Knowledge of that lore is its own reward in God of War, and I loved hunting down every story thread about the mythology I could find. It helps that these discoveries are often stashed near a beautiful vista or deep in a palpably dank cavern. The fascinating juxtaposition is that Kratos is living through some of the very Norse myths I\u2019ve read about, and so I wanted to explore not just so I could learn the tale of Fafnir the Dwarf but to better understand Kratos\u2019 story. Even after the story ended, I sunk at least another 10 to 15 hours (so far) into exploring the world. By all indications, I still have a bit left to find, and I want to uncover every inch of it. Quite often when I\u2019m not playing God of War, I\u2019m thinking about caves left unexplored or the tougher foes left unbeaten. Clever environmental puzzles and collectibles have me returning to places I\u2019ve already been many times over in search of new crevices and corners. That\u2019s largely due to how vast and intriguing the world developer Sony Santa Monica Studio built is, but it\u2019s also because of how gorgeous every environment looks. Even during the 10 or so hours I played on a launch PlayStation 4, I marveled at the scenery \u2013 how lush the tree lines looked, or how pretty a snowy mountainside looked in the distance. And then I played God of War on a PS4 Pro and was blown away by the true level of detail the world holds when bumped up to (checkerboard) 4K. The Beauty\u2019s in the Details I have audibly said \u201cwow\u201d and sighed at the beauty of God of War. The texture of grassy hills in the distance feel real, light dances dazzlingly off of shinier surfaces, and every gnarled monster I have fought conveys such a sense of decay as to instill terror in me. Even the sky looks nearly photo-realistic. And while the beautiful landscapes captivated me, the small details on Kratos and Atreus stunned me. The fur and leather of their outfits move so naturally, and are so finely detailed that they look nearly genuine. I would find myself trying on new pieces of armor just to admire how Kratos\u2019 outfits behaved. All of this beauty comes at a cost, however, and that means God of War runs at or around 30 frames per second instead of the 60 frames that makes action games feel so much smoother. That said, the world and its inhabitants largely ran well for me, outside of the occasional framerate dip when swinging the camera over complex scenery or around in the midst of a cramped battle, or while in the \u201cFavor Resolution\u201d Pro mode , which maintains the higher resolution at the expense of dropping some frames here and there. The \"Favor Performance\" mode visibly ups the framerate, but not to 60 fps in my time with it. But the occasional issues in my playthrough never hindered my progress or noticeably took me out of the experience on either the regular PS4 or the PS4 Pro. Outside of seeing Kratos\u2019 pores in more detail than you might have expected, that higher fidelity also impacts the performances of Judge as Kratos and Sunny Suljic as Atreus because it allows them to convey so much with their faces. The subtle movements of Kratos\u2019 brow, or the changes in Atreus\u2019 walk when he\u2019s feeling down are so lifelike that I found myself lost again and again in their pains and joys. It features easily one of my favorite supporting characters in years. \u201c The two lead actors are elevated by a wonderful supporting cast. A pair of friendly dwarves initially seem like mere comic relief but grow to be integral parts of Kratos and Atreus\u2019 story, with fascinating tales of their own. And the mid-game addition of one key character adds an engaging, hilarious, and heartwarming dynamic to the core duo, transforming this character into easily one of my favorite supporting characters in a game in years. Every God Kratos Has Killed 29 Images The main villains and many of the supporting characters are complex in their motivations, too. Kratos\u2019 (and, by extension, my own) relationship to them transformed in fascinating ways over the course of the adventure. Characters I supposed were merely added for comedic relief turned out to be much more complex, and God of War twists character allegiances and motivations in emotionally relevant ways. And yes, some of those foes are gods, but God of War picks intriguing members of the Norse pantheon, which means we get to see stories of characters other than the popular Thor, Loki, and Odin. While I would have liked to see a few more scenes featuring the main antagonist, the moments involving the big bad are not only captivating but intriguingly mirror the story of Kratos and Atreus, giving nearly every moment deeper meaning. God of War's story revolutionizes a one-note character. \u201c Much of what spurs on Kratos and his friends and enemies is the one true motivator behind most deities in ancient mythologies: family. There\u2019s an incredible and clear level of forethought to not only sustaining and expounding on that theme but to making sure the plot, gameplay, and exploration setups early on continue to pay off in new and exciting ways around every corner. I was continually impressed with how consistently something referenced early on in God of War would come full circle later on, perhaps only then to be revealed as the setup for another payoff. Replaying the first few hours, I was astonished at the cleverness of the foreshadowing. And even though I had only just finished the story, I felt the itch to keep playing on this new save. God of War has so much to offer, and you\u2019ll notice I\u2019ve tried to remain as vague as possible in telling you about all of it. That\u2019s not because God of War hinges its whole structure on a twist, or a gameplay trick you\u2019ll never see coming \u2013 it doesn\u2019t. But what it does offer is a vibrant, fascinating world packed to the brim with secrets I\u2019m still uncovering, centered around a tale that revolutionizes a one-note character. That sense of discovery is rare, and one that should be experienced firsthand."
