        "Content": "There's no single genre on Wii that has more of a hit and miss factor than first-person shooters.  Ubisoft kicked things off with Red Steel during Wii's launch, while the sleeper hit (and unexpected) Call of Duty 3 stole the show for the system's first round.  Fast forward another year, and we've seen the bar raise substantially, with titles like Medal of Honor Heroes 2 topping the charts, and developer High Voltage Software teasing The Conduit for an early 2009 release.  The Wii certainly has its highs, but as anyone unfortunate enough to end up with Quantum of Solace Wii during this holiday season will undoubtedly be able to vouch, the system also has its unmistakable lows.  First of all, let's put this in perspective.  Developer Treyarch (also responsible for the entertaining Call of Duty 3 on Wii) has just now finished up Call of Duty: World at War for all major consoles, including a few Wii-specific efforts, as well as Quantum of Solace for not only 360/PS3, and thus the development duties of Quantum of Solace Wii - made hand-in hand with Treyarch's own design - has been passed off to Beenox Studios.  Despite having a separate team on Bond for Wii, it's obvious that the Wii version played second fiddle to the 360/PS3 efforts from the get-go, as the final product is a mash-up of half-working other system content, and a few original ideas for Nintendo's system.  The game has the right design set in place, mimicking the 360/PS3 SKUs as much as it can, but is a wreck outside of the core design, and we're talking everything from visuals to draw distance, control, bugs, AI problems, and most importantly, abysmal framerate issues.  Like Ubisoft's latest Brothers in Arms effort on Wii, Bond barely runs at times, and in fact has worse performance issues than Double Time does during key instances.  We never thought we'd say that.  Some of the visuals aren't too bad; they just don't look hot in motion.  The core design with Quantum of Solace is the same as it is on 360 and PS3, so you get a mesh of both first-person shooting aspects (the core of the experience), as well as a new cover system used on top of the Call of Duty 4 engine, which allows you to pull off some similar attach and maneuver skills found in games like GRAW, Rainbow Six Vegas, and Gears of War.  For the most part the new design works, as cover is pretty easy to use, and actually really rewarding, though even there you'll find the same issues as on Bond's next gen counterparts, having auto-attach happen when trying to sprint (both assigned to A), and having some areas in the game not activate for cover at all.  Using IR to snipe out enemies from behind the safety of pillars and boxes feels nice, and it proves that a 3rd person action game hinged around cover can work well with the Wii remote.  With that being said, every facet of the game suffers from the same sluggish IR, and it's one of the main plaguing issues in Quantum of Solace.  The framerate itself (throughout the entire game) is unreliable at best, and broken entirely in some areas, but even when the game runs with a decent 30fps or so chug - which granted, is the majority of the time - the IR doesn't refresh that fast, and you get the same general control oddness that's sometimes found in Call of Duty: World at War, though more amplified here.  Move the cursor too fast, and it'll become choppy and slow to catch up with your movements.  Pull up iron sights, and small movements won't register, removing the simple fluidity that comes with Wii's \"point-and-click\" system.  The only saving grace is the game's lock-on system, which will orient the camera on a specific baddie when players hold down Z.  Still, with free IR still in effect during lock-on, it fixes only the camera, leaving aiming again to the player; something that would work great with a reliable cursor, but seriously under delivers in the game's current state.  As a final note on the lock-on, there are again reoccurring issues between Wii and 360/PS3, as the game doesn't always lock on to the character you intended, or sometimes won't lock on when you're aiming at a person still partially under cover.  It works, but it's far from perfect.  The game even attempts to capture some of the next gen feel found on 360 and PS3 with destructible environments, lots of voice work with the original cast, and lower resolution versions of the 360/PS3's CG sequences, but much like the rest of the package, these attempts at stronger presentation just don't pay off like they could have.  There's very little destruction found in the game, with what little we did see focusing around mainly scripted events.  The video sequences - basically lower res 360 footage - can actually lag or go low-frame during playback as well, which certainly doesn't bode well for the overall presentation.   Where the overall product really fails though, and where Quantum of Solace goes from a game that would be for the \"die-hard Bond fans only,\" and instead passes into an \"everyone should avoid it\" situation is the technical offering, specifically in the game's overall framerate.  We've had areas in the game that were nearly impossible to beat due to lag, with the screen dropping to two to three frames per second at times, and with IR control following suit, every dip in performance means a loss in control.  When not in high-intensity areas, the game runs decently, but you'll find the occasional slowdown if you look out windows or towards the horizon line, right before new enemy entrances or scripted sequences, or in random areas due to too much in-level geometry.  If World at War on Wii can take the Call of Duty 4 engine and make it work, Quantum of Solace should be able to as well, and what it really comes down to (the only logical explanation) is that there simply wasn't enough time or manpower on this game to make a significant effort.  It was forced onto Wii, not optimized, and in turn is a pain to play at times.  Other areas though?  Not so good... "

        "Content": "With the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony looks to step into new territory by offering a mid-cycle, higher-power version of its successful PlayStation 4. On paper, the PS4 Pro certainly has the credentials to significantly enhance some existing and future PlayStation 4 games, but in practice, the results range from good to underwhelming depending on what game you\u2019re playing and what kind of screen you\u2019re playing on.  Physically, the PS4 Pro packs a lot of potential in a relatively efficient space. The additional 1GB of DRAM, the second GPU, and the extra power required to feed it don\u2019t add as much bulk as you\u2019d imagine, or from how it looks in pictures. At 11.6 inches wide, 2.2 inches high, and 12.9 inches long, it can fit into practically all the same spaces your launch PS4 can, unless it was a really snug fit already. It is significantly heavier though, by around 30%.  ps4 pro physical shots 13 Images  In terms of inputs and outputs, the PS4 Pro sports two USB ports close together in the front and one more on the back. That third one in the rear is great for PSVR owners, since it allows them to hook it up to the PS4 Pro without using up a front facing USB. This both prevents you from having an unsightly cord constantly sticking out the front of your entertainment center, and keeps the front USB slots free for hooking up controllers or other peripherals. And unlike the recent slimmed-down PS4 revision, the PS4 Pro thankfully has an optical audio port. Dolby Digital headset users rejoice!  Overall, its weight, curved lines, and glossy-finished PlayStation logo give the PS4 Pro a substantial, premium feel, but the cheap-feeling and comically tiny physical eject and power buttons betray the aesthetic just a bit. They\u2019re also a little tough to find until you get used to their odd placement at either side of the Pro\u2019s middle \u201cblade.\u201d   In terms of UI and software features, this is mostly the same PS4 you know and love, which sadly means there\u2019s no support for 4K blu-ray playback. On the upside though, the PS4 Pro supports the higher-speed 802.11ac wi-fi band (which is also on the revised PS4) and the faster SATA III hard drive interface. The latter will potentially allow you to pull much more performance out of a solid-state drive should you decide to replace the stock 1TB hard drive the PS4 Pro comes with. The swap is just a tiny bit trickier on the PS4 Pro than it is on the launch PS4 though, thanks to the somewhat finicky-to-remove panel that guards the access screw.  The 4K Factor  Of course the big new feature is the ability to output at 2160p - true 4K resolution - but the actual resolution of individual games is up to the developers. Because of this lack of standardization, I saw widely mixed amounts of visual impact when playing on 4K monitors.  Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Rise of the Tomb Raider, for instance, both look fantastic with the \u201cenhanced resolution\u201d option selected on a 4K screen. Lighting has a wider color range and everything looks significantly cleaner, especially around the edges. Particularly with Mordor, everyone who walked by while I was playing stopped to gawk, and that\u2019s with what is now a three-year-old game. Properly supported, the PS4 Pro can work wonders.  On the other end of the spectrum is something like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, which ups the resolution to an unspecified degree and upscales to 4K. Not only is it hard to find any appreciable difference in visual quality, but the higher resolution seemed to cause deeper framerate dips than I remember from when I played Mankind Divided on a standard PS4. And unlike some other games, there is no option to play in a lower resolution without forcing it by manually changing the Pro\u2019s output back to 1080p in the system menu. Clearly, there are going to be cases where developers haven\u2019t quite figured out how to best use the power of the Pro.  Totally Optional  The PS4 Pro\u2019s power isn\u2019t just for people with 4K monitors \u2013 again, that is, if the developers choose to take the time to utilize it. When they do, there are some nice visual upgrades for the vast majority of us who don\u2019t own a 4K set. The problem is, there\u2019s no guarantee that developers will make those upgrades, and based on the existing PS4 games that have received their PS4 Pro patch so far, mileage is going to vary greatly.  Shadow of Mordor, Infamous: Second Son, and Rise of the Tomb Raider are good representations of what full-featured PS4 Pro support can look like. Each of them has a list of options in their respective menus, and two of them, Infamous and Tomb Raider, offer a high frame rate option. Especially in the case of Tomb Raider, this mode boosted performance dramatically over the standard PS4 version. Simply put, while the ambiguously named \u201cenhanced visuals\u201d option helps some shaders and reflective surfaces to pop a bit more, the difference was negligible compared to the roughly 50 to 100% increase in performance I witnessed in high frame rate mode. I\u2019d love to see developers provide this option on every game going forward \u2013 but again, there are no guarantees. The lack of consistency over what enhancements you're getting shakes my confidence. \u201c That\u2019s the big issue here: even with the games that leverage the PS4 Pro well, the lack of consistency and clarity regarding what enhancements you are getting from game to game, and even from mode to mode, shakes my confidence. Some games let you change video settings on the fly, others don\u2019t. Some offer high frame rate options while others stick to enhanced visuals or higher resolution. Where higher resolution games are concerned, it\u2019s unclear what resolution they are actually rendering at and what type of upscaling they might be using. Mordor in high resolution mode supersamples on 1080p TVs for a smoother image; do other games do that and just not mention it? I don\u2019t know, and neither will you, which is a real problem. You can read articles, check patch notes, and read option descriptions, but most of the time you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting until you start playing \u2013 and sometimes not even then. Even Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which is one of the first games to launch with Pro support baked in from day one, doesn\u2019t indicate the Pro benefits in-game or even on the back of the box."

        "Content": "The Halo series has the historic distinction of inspiring millions of gamers to spend hundreds of dollars on new consoles just to play it. The Master Chief Collection \u2013 which includes all four numbered entries in the series \u2013 is a great reminder that Halo succeeded not because of hype or flavor-of-the-month popularity, but because of timeless first-person shooter design. With excellent stories, sandbox battlefields, and great AI, everything holds up against modern shooters, many of which owe a huge debt to Halo\u2019s inspiration. It\u2019s all presented beautifully, with remade graphics and sound that allow old hands like me to relive the glory days through rose-tinted glasses, and new fans to appreciate the classics without having to look past decade-plus-old graphics. However, Halo\u2019s memorable multiplayer modes are undermined by unacceptably unreliable and bug-ridden performance in the days after launch, to the point where I can\u2019t recommend that you buy Master Chief Collection right now for that functionality. That\u2019s heartbreaking, but on the bright side there\u2019s still more than enough single-player and co-op content here to strongly recommend it for those alone. The fan service begins right at the main menu: a flick of the thumbstick starts playing the soundtrack of the selected game. It\u2019s a laudable touch, considering how big a part Halo\u2019s musical scores have played in establishing the series\u2019 memorable atmosphere. I jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014\u2019s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges \u2013 I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they\u2019re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don\u2019t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s parts \u2013 most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second \u2013 trumps its minor annoyances. I\u2019m giving the audio a standing ovation. Halo 2\u2019s already-great soundtrack has been remastered, and sounds bigger and fuller while remaining reverential and respectful to the original. It\u2019s so good I\u2019d listen to it in my car. Meanwhile, Chief\u2019s chunky metallic footsteps have been added, and every weapon sound has been replaced with beefier, more aggressive versions. The new Battle Rifle and sniper rifle in particular pack a satisfying wallop, but I could\u2019ve done without the more musical Covenant energy sword and overcharged plasma pistol effect. It sounds like the Jetsons\u2019 car floating by. You can appreciate the contrast easily, because the audio, like the visuals, also cycles between the 2004 original versions and the 2014 remastering along with the graphics. And you know what? Halo 2 remains a damn fine game, especially now that you can jump straight into Halo 3 and minimize the whiplash of that hard-stop of an ending. Bombastic set pieces like the battle on the Scarab, the Scorpion tank trek across the bridge, and the Banshee run near the end all mix with a plot that ably weaves the parallel stories of Master Chief and the Arbiter. Phenomenal new cutscenes not only breathe new life into the plot, but make me long for a feature-length CG Halo film. The best example is the stunning Gravemind scene. What was an unintentionally hilarious conversation with a featureless brown worm is now a dramatic confrontation with the hideous amalgamation of all Flood parasites, rendered here in disgusting detail. Buy 1, Get 3 Free The other three included Halo games all run at 60fps too, but all suffer from the same noticeable, but far from crippling framerate dips. That doubled speed gives the campaigns and multiplayer modes alike a newfound smoothness and polished feel. All but Halo 2 run at 1080p, which still looks good at the slightly lower resolution of 1328 by 1080. There\u2019s no going back from this smoother framerate: the Master Chief Collection is the definitive version of each of these games. It\u2019s great to see the lost art of local split-screen co-op multiplayer revived here, in all four games. It\u2019s now much more playable, thanks to splitting 1080 lines of resolution between players instead of just 320, and on much larger TVs than were common a decade ago. Don\u2019t expect to maintain 60 frames per second in split-screen, though \u2013 the dips are far more frequent this way. Master Chief Collection\u2019s version of Combat Evolved is based off of 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. It can\u2019t match up to Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s Xbox One-ified upgrade, but it\u2019s a whole lot better than dusting off your 2001 Xbox to replay this still-great game. Some things, like Chief\u2019s relatively short jump height and inability to board vehicles, feel a bit archaic now. But the original Halo\u2019s excellent story and still-remarkable large-scale combat sandboxes \u2013 not to mention the goosebump-inducing chanting-monks theme \u2013 make the first Halo both enjoyable and relevant in 2014. Halo 3 is probably the relative low point in the looks department. It has neither the benefit of Halo CE or Halo 2\u2019s recent coat of Anniversary paint, nor of being fairly new like Halo 4. The resolution and framerate boosts do give it a nice, clean look, at least. And with the exception of that exacerbating \u201cCortana\u201d mission, it remains arguably the series\u2019 finest start-to-finish campaign, complete with an ending that retains all of its emotional punch. As for Halo 4, its stunning visuals are Master Chief Collection\u2019s most pleasant surprise. What was already a high point for graphics on Xbox 360 legitimately looks like it was made for Xbox One when running at 1080p and 60fps. Its sound design remains the best in the series, too, aside from the Battle Rifle. I wish it\u2019d gotten the same sound thunderous effect as Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s version, because now it sounds like a child\u2019s toy by comparison. Master Chief Collection also offers Campaign Playlists, a clever way to take advantage the fact that all four Master Chief adventures are under the same roof. Whether you\u2019re playing the last levels of each campaign back-to-back or consecutively tackling every tank mission on the disc, they\u2019re a clever addition \u2013 particularly in local or online co-op. Multiplayer Tragically, online functionality has been extremely messy in the days following Master Chief Collection\u2019s launch. I\u2019ve seen everything from extended matchmaking wait times to being dumped into a seemingly random map and gametype option that wasn\u2019t voted for. Additionally, crashes to desktop, freezes, parties being split up into separate teams, uneven team pairings, and custom-game oddities like mixing up the teams when time you come out of a match mean that, for the time being, you have to wrestle with Master Chief Collection just to play it online. It\u2019s a true shame that, for now, Halo 2 was easier to play with your friends a decade ago than it is today on exponentially more powerful hardware and a more robust Xbox Live. When it works like it\u2019s supposed to, as it did at a pre-release review event and hopefully will for everyone one day soon, Master Chief Collection\u2019s massive multiplayer suite makes me happy. That\u2019s primarily because it gives me two things I\u2019ve waited years for: the ability to play Halo 2 on Xbox Live again and the chance to play the original Halo\u2019s groundbreaking multiplayer online (which even Halo CE Anniversary spectacularly failed to give). It\u2019s here, and on dedicated servers, no less (in matchmaking; custom games are peer-to-peer, as they always were), with the multiplayer modes of Halo 3 and 4 thrown in for good measure.

Running around Blood Gulch, Hang \u2018em High, or Sidewinder and three-shotting my friends with Halo CE\u2019s lethal default pistol is nostalgically satisfying, but Halo 2 made such a leap in terms of gameplay and features that it makes Halo CE feel its age more than the others. Perhaps Halo 2\u2019s greatest accomplishment is its incredible complement of maps, many of which remain classics. Swords-only on Lockout, 1-Flag CTF on Zanzibar, anything on Midship, \u2013 Halo 2 packs 25 maps, and 90 percent of them are gems. And long-gone but not forgotten gametypes like Fiesta are lovingly resurfaced, as are the deep customization options. For instance, I resurrected an old Coagulation map variant I created 10 years ago called Covie Gulch, which replaces the Scorpion tank with the Wraith and the Warthog with the long-absent Spectre. It\u2019s all back, with the small but annoying exceptions of no longer being able to transfer party leadership to another person in your group and the presence of open-channel voice chat instead of Halo 2\u2019s useful proximity/push-to-open-a-channel combo. Elsewhere, there are six Halo 2 Anniversary maps \u2013 a separate group of remakes on top of the complete original complement of Halo 2 battlegrounds \u2013 and they deserve special mention. These half-dozen built-for-Xbox One stages are, quite literally, modern takes on some of Halo 2\u2019s best maps. They dutifully recreate the exact, welcome feel of Halo 2 in addition to the look. In fact, while it\u2019s hard to complain about content when there\u2019s so much of it, the six Anniversary maps are so beautiful and fun that I really wish there were more of them \u2013 particularly since they have their own matchmaking playlist on Xbox Live . Halo 3 and 4, meanwhile, also return exactly as you remember them. For all the benefit of having every Halo multiplayer here, the downside is that it really is jarring to jump from game to game in consecutive multiplayer matches. A universal control scheme option mitigates this somewhat, but that doesn\u2019t account for the mental and physical adjustments you have to make for the differences in jump heights, physics, weapons, etc. between each. The Battle Rifle appears in Halos 2, 3, and 4 for instance, but it is its own unique animal in each. Finally, in the context of multiplayer, the game-unifying interface is mostly successful in helping to easily parse through so many choices. I appreciate how you can press a button to go straight back to the top menu, rather than have to repeatedly B-button your way back, step by step, if you want to go do something else. One complaint, though: it oddly fails to show you a preview of your Spartan or Elite multiplayer avatar after you build it in the very same interface."

        "Content": "Hyrule Warriors Legends for 3DS is the portable version of Hyrule Warriors for the Wii U. Here\u2019s what we said about that game in 2014:  \u201cSurprisingly, Hyrule Warriors does a good job of tying together the combat of Dynasty Warriors and the revered characters and lore of the Legend of Zelda series in a way that makes me feel powerful in a world I love. Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. It\u2019s just a shame you can\u2019t share the action with a friend without significant slowdown.\u201d  Read the original Hyrule Warriors review here . Most of this still holds true for Hyrule Warriors Legends, but the shoddy performance of this 3DS port makes it a lot less desirable, particularly when compared to the New 3DS version. You can read our full review of that version here .   While Hyrule Warriors Legends runs fine on the New 3DS, the choppy performance on 3DS and 2DS make it extremely difficult to enjoy. This is a repetitive action game that puts dozens of enemies onscreen at once for you to attack, but each successful sword swing and item toss felt hollow because of the awful amounts of slowdown. The terrible framerate takes nearly all of the fun out of Legends\u2019 crowded skirmishes, making them feel double the length that they should. When you factor in the shabby graphics, lame effects, and noticeable pop-in of this port, it\u2019s difficult to recommend this game to owners of the standard 3DS.  ...the choppy performance on 3DS and 2DS make it extremely difficult to enjoy. \u201c  Technical failings like these suck the wind out of a game that, otherwise, is brimming with fanservice for Zelda fans. Take the epic scale of the first boss fight with Dodongo. Rather than charge through the wall with an effective explosion, the barricade simply vanishes on contact, resulting in a cheap-looking setup for a big moment that feels incomplete. It\u2019s a brief but jarring example of how slipshod this port can feel at times, and even ignoring that, Dodongo and the rest of the bosses look equally lame thanks to hideously low-resolution textures. Rather than make use of the 3DS\u2019s graphics capability to make textures that look good at lower resolution, this port simply scales down the Wii U textures until they\u2019re a blurry mess. Even a lot of the menus look bad because of horribly smudged or blurry art.   The sad thing is that these issues spoil a few smart changes that make this mindless action game a much better experience on a handheld. A quick-swap feature lets you instantly switch characters mid-battle, and you can even direct fellow soldiers like Zelda and Impa on the map using the touch screen. This change has a major impact on how you control the flow of battle: it goes from a frantic dash from place to place to a much more strategic flow. You can now spread out your units and switch your attention to skirmishes that need immediate action when appropriate. Legends also introduces Owl Statues that can be activated with a handy Ocarina item, which helps you teleport quickly around the map. I felt more well-equipped to handle waves of foes that had given me trouble in the Wii U version. ...each successful sword swing and item toss felt hollow because of the awful amounts of slowdown. \u201c Also on the bright side, it was the many layers of Zelda fanservice that managed to keep my attention for Hyrule Warrior\u2019s 10-hour campaign the first time around, and Legends adds to that with five new characters on top of the already-packed roster, for a total of 24 warriors, including the ones previously released as DLC. New characters Toon Link, Tetra, and King Daphnes each introduce fresh and distinct movesets while bringing the criminally under-represented cast of  Wind Waker into the fold.  Skull Kid\u2019s playful fighting style and Ocarina sound effects make lots of nods to his debut in Majora\u2019s Mask, while Linkle (a female version of Link) wields a pair of crossbows and juggles opponents with acrobatic flair. As a bonus, if you own the Wii U version, buying the 3DS version gets you a code to unlock all of these five new characters there, too."

Alas, God of War Collection for the Vita is a weak port of the 2009 PS3 HD remastering, with muddled graphics, flawed audio, and less than fluid gameplay, all of which renders it the least flattering way to embody Sparta's angriest warrior. Straight out of the gate, I was disappointed by the noticeable downgrade in visuals. While it would be silly and naive to expect the Vita to reproduce the exact same high resolution and 60 frames-per-second framerate touted by its PS3 predecessor, I figured the Vita could still do a decent job of showing just how pretty God of War can be. Yet, God of War Collection just doesn\u2019t look all that impressive on the Vita. Environments appear less detailed and a bit bland, and everything from character models to objects look slightly out of focus, as if the camera lens needs to be adjusted in order to see Kratos' grumpy face more clearly.  There's no option to adjust the screen size either, so everything is stretched out, an effect I found rather unflattering. Even more disappointing than the visuals is the audio.  In cutscenes, Kratos\u2019 anger and gravitas come through clear enough, but in-game he sounds muffled, as if he and other character are communicating on walkie-talkies (\"This is Ghost of Sparta. Over!\"). It\u2019s a side effect of audio compression that can\u2019t be corrected by adjusting the volume of the sound effects or music, and it greatly detracted from my overall enjoyment of the solid voice acting. Even the gameplay isn\u2019t quite as fun as it should be. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it\u2019s still a blast unleashing a chain of crazy cool combos and smiting enemies with godlike powers (and better yet being rewarded for it with PlayStation trophies), but I was sad to see some of the fluidity of Kratos\u2019 movements has disappeared -- an unfortunate consequence of a lower framerate which causes both God of War 1 and 2 to chug when there\u2019s a lot of activity on screen. While platforming is still somewhat enjoyable, interacting with the environment is a bit more arduous this time around, due to developer Sanzaru (the party responsible for this port) feeling obliged to shoehorn the Vita\u2019s back touchscreen controls into the gameplay. Instead of simply holding or tapping the circle button to open chests and lift heavy doors, I was now forced to do so while pressing the back touchscreen, which felt rather awkward. It\u2019s a superfluous addition that, at times, interfered with the general flow of exploration, especially when it caused me to accidentally activate levers at inopportune moments. This displeases me...",

        "Content": "AMD has hit a stride with its RX 5000 series of graphics cards . With the launch of the RX 5700 , 5700 XT , and most recently the RX 5500 XT , the company aimed to provide the best value for the money in each card\u2019s respective price bracket. Today, we\u2019re looking at the 5600 XT, a card AMD describes as being the \u201cultimate graphics card for 1080p gaming.\u201d Priced competitively at $279 on the low end, is it finally time to upgrade?   Design and Features Like the 5500 XT, there is no reference version of the 5600 XT, so graphics card companies have been set free to design their own versions. Options are plentiful. As a gamer, you have your pick of factory overclocks, cooling solutions, and unique looks to match your setup. This approach also means that you\u2019ll have different pricing options that scale up with features and overclocks. As of today, RX 5600 XT prices range from $279 all the way to $309 for larger, triple-fan cards and high-end overclocks.  Even though AMD isn\u2019t selling its own card, the company still released reference specs for vendors to build on. The 5600 XT features 2,304 shader cores and a base clock of 1,130MHz. Under load, it\u2019s able to boost up to 1,560MHz with an expected Game Frequency of 1375 MHz, though this varies from game to game. The 5600 XT comes stock with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM running at 12GB/s for a total memory bandwidth of 288GB/s. At 1080p, few games demand more memory than that, so you should be able to max out textures without hitting a bottleneck on most games. The version we were sent for testing is the Sapphire Pulse OC. Like most third-party cards, it comes overclocked out of the box. The boost clock on this model can spin up to 1,750MHz under load and has an expected game clock of 1615 MHz. This increase is in thanks to a pre-release BIOS update which also increased the effective memory bandwidth to 14 GB/s. It also features Sapphire\u2019s Dual-X cooling solution which uses two large fans and a radiator to keep its components cool. Because there is no reference model and clock speeds and cooling will vary between cards, the actual performance of different models will vary. Differences shouldn\u2019t be major, but it\u2019s still worth considering your model carefully before buying.  For display support, the Pulse comes equipped with three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs and a single HDMI 2.0. Each offers support for high refresh rate monitors and HDR, as well as AMD FreeSync 2 to eliminate screen tearing. The 5600 XT is able to drive up to four displays simultaneously for immersive gameplay experiences. As an RX 5000 series card, it supports Radeon specific features like Radeon Image Sharpening and Radeon Anti-Lag. Radeon\u2019s Image Sharpening is the unstated hero of this generation of Radeon graphics cards, offering noticeable enhancements to the crispness of visuals without the performance hit of increasing the resolution. Radeon Anti-Lag is a boon to competitive gamers, reducing input lag by synchronizing the processing of the graphics card and processor . Another neat feature is Radeon Boost. It increases game performance by dynamically lowering the game\u2019s resolution when in motion. Because the game is in motion when it works its magic, it\u2019s much more difficult to spot. As game demands increase, this feature will help you keep frame rates smooth when they might otherwise stutter.   Performance To test the performance of the RX 5600 XT, I ran it through our stable of test games. Each game was set to the ultra presets or highest settings where that wasn\u2019t possible and anti-aliasing was disabled. We are currently in the process of updating our test bench, so this card was tested in my personal system. It is currently running a Ryzen 9 3900X with 32GB of 3600MHz G.Skill TridentZ Neo memory, and is free of any bottlenecks that would hinder performance. When the new bench is complete, I\u2019ll be retesting each of the cards below and many more to stay current with driver-based performance improvements. Note: I completed my testing using the latest driver and BIOS version available for the Sapphire Pulse. If you decide to pick up a 5600 XT for yourself, you should check to see if the manufacturer has updates available for your card to achieve the best possible performance.   Based on these results, it\u2019s clear that the RX 5600 XT is an outstanding card for 1080p gaming. In every case except for Shadow of the Tomb Raider , it was able to exceed 60 FPS at Ultra presets/max settings. By lowering some of the most performance heavy settings, these results could be increased further. It\u2019s especially interesting to see that the card offers very playable frame rates even at 1440p. Sapphire\u2019s Dual-X cooling also did the trick with the card never exceeding 75 degrees celsius in any game. Staying with Team Red for a moment, the card offers a major upgrade from the 5500 XT. This isn\u2019t surprising since the card is roughly $100 more, but if you\u2019re on the fence and can afford to wait, it\u2019s well worth saving up the extra cash. Compared to its closest competition from Nvidia, the GTX 1660 Ti , things become more heated. The RX 5600 XT consistently trades blows with the GTX 1660 Ti (and to a lesser extent the GTX 1660 Super ). With performance results like these, pricing matters more than ever. Our Sapphire Pulse version of the 5600 XT retails for $289.99 while the GTX 1660 Ti can be had for as little as $274.99. For my money, I would still lean toward the RX 5600 XT due to AMD\u2019s software enhancements, but in sheer FPS the 1660 Ti seems to be the better value. The battle for \u201cbest value\u201d doesn\u2019t end there, however. Leading up to the launch of the RX 5600 XT, Nvidia lowered the price of the RTX 2060 Founder\u2019s Edition to $299, and worked with EVGA to release a \u201cKO\u201d model for the same price that offers enhanced cooling. The RTX 2060 outperforms the RX 5600 XT in all but rare circumstances and includes the major feature of real time ray tracing, which the 5600 XT lacks. The value proposition is much trickier between these two cards. Ray tracing has the potential to offer much more realistic lighting in games, and both next-gen consoles have also been confirmed to feature it. With support coming on consoles (which often drive PC gaming tech), it\u2019s very likely that ray tracing will become a more major feature than it is today. While investing in the 5600 XT might save a few dollars upfront, if ray tracing is something you eventually want, it may lead to an earlier upgrade than just saving up for the RTX 2060. At the same time, Radeon Image Sharpening offers a definite improvement you can benefit from today. More than most GPU comparisons, this is really a case of what matters most to you, and is worth considering how that might change overtime.  Purchasing Guide The AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT is available at a starting price of $279. The specific version of this GPU we reviewed was the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5600 XT and it retails for a slightly higher $289 price at Amazon. Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5600 XT On Amazon See It"

        "Content": "While I had just as much fun playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PC as Tom did playing for his review , on the base PlayStation 4 or Xbox One it is a different game entirely. It fails to hit even the lowest bar of technical quality one should expect even when playing on lower-end hardware. It performs so poorly that it makes combat, driving, and what is otherwise a master craft of storytelling legitimately difficult to look at. It is not an exaggeration to say that I\u2019ve felt nauseated after playing because of the terrible frame rate. It really is that bad, and it\u2019s very suspicious that CD Projekt Red refused to provide console review copies ahead of launch.  In my original tests on patch 1.02 , frame rate dipped into the teens on Xbox One during key story moments involving combat, and while patch 1.04 promised more stability , it still struggles to maintain 30fps and crashes are still frequent. At best it will regularly crash to the system screen on Xbox One; at worst it\u2019ll hard-lock your system and you have to turn it off and on again. In short, neither the PS4 or Xbox One is able to hold a steady frame rate, and they often freeze altogether for seconds at a time. On the base model Xbox One, it appears to be running at less than 720p resolution at times (though that fluctuates due to dynamic scaling). Even so, you can expect to see it drop as low as 10 frames per second during combat, which is all but unplayable, and it\u2019s around 20fps even when you\u2019re doing simple and routine things like walking outside in the introduction. The PS4 is slightly better in performance and stability since patch 1.04, but at the sacrifice of texture load-in time. Characters will often appear blocky while you wait an agonizingly long time for their faces to show up to the party, and geometry or textures will sometimes fail to appear even with all the effects like film grain and motion blur turned off. The Xbox One/PS4 version is nearly unrecognizable compared to the PC version. \u201c Both platforms have several major issues with the open world, such as signs that have no graphics at all until they eventually load in about five seconds later (making it impossible to navigate without the map) and explosions or effects that happen comically late or fail to trigger at all. It\u2019s not just visual: the enemy AI will sometimes break and won\u2019t shoot at you. The excellent voice acting is one of the few things that holds up \u2013 everything else is nearly unrecognizable compared to the PC version. Even the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, which have some problems of their own, are a huge step up from this technical mess. If you bought Cyberpunk 2077 for Xbox One or PS4, what's your plan?

        "Content": "First, let me say that despite the fact that I've spent most of my career here at IGN reviewing games (mostly sports titles) in full HD glory on consoles, that in no way means that I expect an iPhone game to deliver the same breadth of features or overall playability. That withstanding, I was still disappointed with NCAA Football 11 \"HD \" on iPhone 4.  The first thing that is bound to anger college football diehards is the inclusion of only about half of the Division 1 teams out there. You miss out on the likes of South Florida, Texas A&M and Central Florida to name only a few of the notable omissions. I, for one, forgive EA Sports for only including half of the 110+ teams. After all, including the full list would presumably make a sizable dent in your iPhone's memory. Besides, most of the top teams are aptly represented with the usual assortment of plays and I'm okay with the fact that playbooks aren't team-specific. Instead my real problem with the game shows itself once you step onto the field of play.  I don't know about you, but when a company ups the price of a product by roughly 15%, I expect to get something substantive for my investment. Even if that investment is just a measly buck. Instead, EA Sports has bestowed the iPhone 4 version with nothing more than some moderately more attractive visuals. Edges on player models are certainly smoother and the menus have the usual visual pop that users of the iPhone 4 expect, but the framerate is abysmal, perhaps worse than I saw in Madden NFL 10 last year on my iPhone 3GS.  It really seems like they simply upped the resolution on a few textures and flipped on some form of anti-aliasing without optimizing the engine to smooth things out. I tried turning off my cellular and Wi-Fi service and that made performance increase slightly, but given the excellent framerate I've seen from other games built for the iPhone 4 (like Real Racing) there's really no excuse for NCAA Football 11's lackluster gameplay speed.  Making matters worse are unresponsive controls. Unlike in the previously released Madden NFL 10 (which shares almost every control mechanic with NCAA Football 11), NCAA feels like it's always trying to push players forward when you have the ball. That translated to me having much less control over finite directional movements. Too often, I'd try and angle my guy carrying the ball slightly to the right to take a better angle at a would-be tackler and gain a few extra yards, only to have him continue on dead ahead. The weirdest part? The game knew I was trying to take a different angle because the arrow under my player moved accordingly, but the actual player himself didn't budge.  The one new control mechanic that they've added to NCAA Football is the ability to pull off option plays thanks to an automated slow-motion effect. The only problem is that the slow-mo effect begins as soon as you hike the ball rather than when you need time to pitch the ball to your running back. Every other mechanic is identical to what was seen in Madden NFL 10. You still can't check your play art on defense pre-snap and the user-activated slowdown still works well on both offense and defense (at least when the framerate isn't working against you).  As for modes, you'll find the usual Play Now and Season offerings. Playing through a full season and winding up in a bowl game that you know and love is pretty darn cool and helps bring everything a bit closer to reality. There's a new Create-A-Team Mode that's really nothing more than a team editor in that you have to use one of the teams that's already in the game as a starting point. You have to keep their logo in place and can only change their color scheme, select a new stadium type from a list of six, and alter their rosters to include player names. The coolest aspect is undoubtedly the ability to select three different fight songs from your iPod library to play at different moments during gameplay. It's an extremely simple mechanic, but it's great to hear some Metallica chime in when you reach the red zone.  There's a Multiplayer Mode as well that takes advantage of the Bluetooth abilities of the iPhone, or at least it tries to. NCAA's Bluetooth multiplayer functionality suffers in the framerate department to a greater degree than standard gameplay, and that's even with editor Levi Buchanan playing within arm's reach of me."

        "Content": "I can\u2019t help but feel just a little bad for the folks at Iron Galaxy. In many ways, porting the excellent Borderlands 2 to Vita could be considered a fool\u2019s errand of sorts, but they\u2019ve pulled it off as well as anyone could have expected. If that sounds like conditional praise, it\u2019s because it is. The Vita version of Borderlands 2 is remarkably content complete, right down to the two DLC character classes and all the major expansions, but that means very little given how deeply and consistently its technical issues compromise the moment-to-moment gameplay that\u2019s supposed to form the core of the experience.  Few games have had a longer train of substantial DLC add-ons than Borderlands 2 has, and getting it all crammed onto the Vita is an impressive feat by any measurement. Of course, corners have been noticeably cut in order to make that happen \u2013 sound has been compressed, and many textures and effects have been simplified to make weight as well. Even on the Vita\u2019s beautiful screen, Borderlands 2 lacks the color and crispness of both its console brethren, and more importantly, other games on the platform. Cross-Save functionality is a boon to be sure, as is the ability to play online, though the drop to two players from four is another example of the watering down that had to be done to make portable Borderlands a reality.  These compromises are the least of this port\u2019s worries though. Borderlands 2 has never been about visual splendor, but about fluidly placing bullets or blades between the eyes of all manner of monsters and bandits. At its best, Borderlands 2 on Vita plays like your Vault Hunter is fighting underwater with dumbbells strapped to their ankles; at its worst, it\u2019s a nearly unplayable slideshow. Even during rare stretches where it maintains a constant framerate, it\u2019s well south of 30, and it hitches at random like playing an MMO on dial-up. The \u201climitations of hardware\u201d excuse just doesn\u2019t apply here. Killzone: Mercenary, and Uncharted: Golden Abyss both managed solid performance and stunning visuals, making Borderlands 2\u2019s showing a disappointment by Vita standards.  The coup de grace is the ungainly control scheme, which hurt my hands about as much as the flickering framerate hurt my eyes. On console or PC, Borderlands 2 uses every button available, so it\u2019s only logical that getting it to work on the Vita would require some compromise, but placing vital gameplay functions like sprint and melee on the unresponsive rear touch pad was not the way to go. Aside from being painfully awkward to reach, the rear panel just flat out doesn\u2019t work half of the time. Sure you can remap the controls, but no matter which way you slice it, two functions are always going to be unreliable, and that\u2019s two too many. The sum of these compromises is simply too hefty, making just about every firefight feel like a chore. The fact that I know just how great those very same encounters can be when I\u2019m not being forced to slowly hobble through them just makes playing this version of Borderlands 2 that much more frustrating.",

It is a genuinely amazing package that now includes six of Microsoft\u2019s classic single-player and co-op campaigns and legendary multiplayer modes, at long last free of any red-flag technical caveats. 343 Industries deserves a ton of credit for sticking with it after a notoriously bad launch and completing the long-term renovation of the house while its occupants lived (and played) inside. It\u2019s admittedly a bit later than I\u2019d anticipated, but the love letter to Master Chief has finally been delivered. Crucially, matchmaking just works . I\u2019ve played around 30 rounds in the past week with no fuss, no drops, no lag, and no BS.

Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images Granted, I did often have to wait, sometimes for up to three minutes. Even though The Master Chief Collection is available to everybody on Xbox Game Pass and the community is healthy, this isn\u2019t quite like the Halo 2/Halo 3 heyday where everybody and their mother was playing and you could find a game in seconds. But in every single instance, I always got what I wanted. And when the rounds actually started, they were buttery smooth every single time \u2013 even in Halo 1, which was never designed for online play. Furthermore, quality-of-life features such as a Modern Controls option, customizable and highly specific thumbstick dead zone settings, a text chat window, and a bump to 4K and a now-rock-solid 60fps on the Xbox One X highlight how Master Chief Collection feels like a fresh, modern, living entity rather than just a five-year-old package of even older ports held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands.

What's the best Halo game overall (factoring in campaign AND multiplayer)? Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 2 Halo 3 Halo 3: ODST Halo Reach Halo 4 Halo 5: Guardians Answer See Results  A quick word on Halo Reach, as it\u2019s the most recent addition to MCC and the first part of launching the whole package on PC. In short, for a nine-year-old game, it still looks quite good after its 4K cleanup on both Xbox One and PC, and it controls beautifully. 343\u2019s first PC game feels a lot more natural on mouse and keyboard than when Gearbox brought Halo 1 to PC back in 2003, and offers PC-centric customization options like FOV adjustments. Audio issues are a bit wonky right now, though, with sound levels for various elements being too loud or too soft, but it\u2019s more of an annoyance. If the rest of the Master Chief Collection\u2019s PC ports are up to this standard, that\u2019ll be excellent news. All of the previously included campaigns have aged gracefully, too. Halo 4 remains underappreciated, and with its 4K/60fps enhancement it still looks like a recent game on Xbox One X. Halo 3, ODST (also new since MCC\u2019s original launch), and Reach are largely unchanged outside of the resolution and framerate bump, and even Combat Evolved looks surprisingly clean, image quality-wise, for an almost 20-year-old game. It\u2019s a classic for a reason. Halo 2\u2019s Anniversary treatment, meanwhile \u2013 which enhanced both the campaign and a select group of multiplayer maps (everything\u2019s available, though most of it hasn\u2019t gotten the facelift) is holding up nicely. Here\u2019s what I said about it in my 2014 review, all of which remains true today: \u201cI jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014\u2019s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges \u2013 I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they\u2019re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don\u2019t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s parts \u2013 most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second \u2013 trumps its minor annoyances.\u201d   About My Original Review This one has always bothered me. See, I got my original review of 2014\u2019s Halo: The Master Chief Collection wrong. I held it for a few days after launch at the time, hoping 343 would patch up the then-four-game collection\u2019s catastrophic matchmaking and connectivity issues, and then I put a 9.0 on it on the strength of its four fantastic campaigns and the faith that the multiplayer issues would be resolved soon enough. As it turned out, of course, The Master Chief Collection didn\u2019t deserve the benefit of the doubt. What should\u2019ve been a dream package for Halo fans was instead a nightmare on the multiplayer side. And for our part, we learned an important lesson and soon began making more use of reviews in progress for server-dependant games in order to help prevent this from happening again. Fast-forward five years and a lot has changed. Xbox Game Pass is a thing now, and any subscriber gets full access to MCC. The Xbox One X also exists, and playing MCC on it gives you 4K resolution. Even better, the collection has grown to six games, adding Halo 3: ODST and, most recently, Halo Reach (including Firefight mode). The latter is also now available on PC \u2013 via Steam, no less! \u2013 and serves as the starting point for bringing the whole shebang faithfully to Windows, game by game, between now and Halo Infinite\u2019s launch in Fall 2020.

I am both surprised and heartened that such fare remains fun today in games like Radiant Silvergun . Originally released in 1998, the vertically-scrolling shooter finds its way to Xbox Live Arcade with modern conveniences like online multiplayer and high-definition visuals. Developed by Treasure , the same guys we have to thank for the amazing Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun still impresses with its clever gunplay.  Radiant Silvergun attempts to set up a story with an anime intro sequence, but the convoluted exposition is inconsequential to your enjoyment of the game. There are bad guys swarming you and shooting them down proves fun enough to provide all the motivation you'll need.    This remake runs in its original 4:3 ratio and includes a handful of attractive wallpapers to decorate the remaining bits of your TV with. The new high-resolution graphics smooth out the pixilated look of the original, but purists can play with the old school chunky sprites if they like.  Arcade and Story modes  offer two variations of the same blow everything up model, with Story allowing you to save a persistent profile and constantly upgrade your ship over time. This addictive feature makes you feel like a play session is never wasted, no matter how poor your performance, because you always earn experience points that carry over to your next game.  Radiant Silvergun's trick is that it doesn't have any power-ups. It gives you seven weapons right from the start that all work well in different situations. You earn experience points for the kills you make with each gun that automatically level up that particular weapon. Effectively, the guns you prefer will always become more and more powerful just by playing the game.  The other major aspect of Radiant Silvergun is the color-coded combo system that rewards you with bonus experience points for consecutively shooting down enemies of the same ilk. Playing this way turns the game into more of a puzzler where you must choose carefully which enemies you blow up. I find it refreshing to play a shooter that has more to offer than just crazed gunplay (although there is nothing wrong with crazed gunplay, either).  For multiplayer, you can bring a friend along either locally or online. Full disclosure: I have not had a chance to test the online multiplayer, yet. But we've been having a blast playing local two-player here in the IGN office.  Finally, Radiant Silvergun's epic soundtrack is fantastic. I've been humming it whenever I haven't been playing. ",

With the Radeon RX 6700 XT, AMD has this resolution squarely in its sights. This also places the card in direct competition with Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070  graphics card . At $479, it comes in $20 cheaper, but does it have the performance to compete? AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT Review 9 Images  AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT - Design and Features The RX 6700 XT is the fourth Radeon card to release this generation and continues the same styling of its predecessors. That means a GPU that looks almost like a futuristic sports car with its mix of black and chrome-accented silver. The blacked-out heatsink even looks a bit like a grille, though I suspect the red trim and illuminated Radeon logo won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s liking, especially if they already have custom lighting in their PC. Still, it\u2019s a sleek, svelte card with a two-fan cooler and two-slot width that should fit in most PCs. As expected, the RX 6700 XT is built on the RDNA 2 architecture and is part of AMD\u2019s effort to deliver a full range of GPUs for gamers this generation. At the time of its release, the 6700 XT is the lowest-tier offering and the most accessiblely priced. As such, there are some scale-backs here, but this is definitely a full-featured card designed to compete with the current generation of gaming GPUs. That means gamers can expect most of the same benefits I\u2019ve reported on with previous Radeon RX 6000-series cards: hardware-based ray tracing, Smart Access Memory, and AMD\u2019s Infinity Cache solution to reduce memory latency and boost performance. This also means higher clock speeds and better performance per watt than the RX 5700 XT.  Importantly, RDNA 2 also works with DirectX 12 Ultimate. Of specific note are mesh and variable rate shading. This allows the GPU to intelligently control the level of detail and shading of scenes to prioritize what\u2019s most perceptible to the gamer. It\u2019s a smart way to save performance and prioritize what matters most. Nvidia also supports these features, so while it isn\u2019t exclusive to AMD, it\u2019s an important feature to even approach performance parity. On paper, the RX 6700 XT impresses. It features 17.1 million transistors, a 67% improvement from last-gen\u2019s RX 5700 XT, and runs ridiculously fast. The Game Clock speed is rated for 2.42 GHz with a maximum Boost Clock speed of 2.58 GHz. In contrast, the RTX 3070 often peaked just shy of 2 GHz. In fact, the RX 6700 XT is the fastest card AMD has released this generation by a good margin. The RX 6800 XT was rated for a top speed of 2.25 GHz and pushed to 2.5 GHz with Rage Mode enabled. The 6700 XT, on the other hand, peaked at an incredible 2.64 GHz and tended to hover at 2.5 GHz on stock settings. The Radeon Software also supports automatic, one-button overclocking to push this even further should users desire. All of that speed comes at the cost of heat. In my testing, the card peaked at 85C and hovered only slightly lower at 83C while gaming. I expected this after testing the RX 6800 and 6800 XT, and AMD has been quick to point out that this is nothing to be concerned with. The RX 6700 XT uses a network of sensors to determine its thermal threshold instead of a traditional single-point probe and can actually hit 110C before thermal throttling, so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue for most gamers. Still, after experiencing the impressively low temperatures on Nvidia\u2019s RTX-3000 series, I would have liked to see AMD answer with lower temperatures of its own, even if that means a larger heatsink.  Compared to the next-step-up RX 6800, the card is expectedly more limited. It features a total of 40 compute units versus that more expensive card\u2019s 60. In addition, it sports only 12 GB of GDDR6 video memory (versus 16 GB) and utilizes a 192-bit bus instead of 256-bit. To close that gap, AMD has equipped the card with 96MB of Infinity Cache, claiming \u201c2.5x effective bandwidth\u201d compared to 12 gigabytes of VRAM on the wider 256-bit bus. In practice, I didn\u2019t find this scaleback to be a major limitation to my gameplay in any way. Likewise, the overall capacity is a smart match for the trajectory of games today. Very few major titles utilize 12 GB of memory, which gives the card a bit of headroom to grow into future games without over-delivering and driving up costs. The card also supports AMD\u2019s suite of software enhancements. The FidelityFX suite is easily accessible and has undergone tremendous improvements over the last two generations, making it easy to navigate and enable image-enhancing features. Radeon Image Sharpening is a particular favorite of mine to add a level of crispness to the picture though it still falls short of an actual upscaling solution like Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling. What resolution and refresh rate do you game at? 4K 120Hz+ 4K 60Hz 1440p 144Hz+ 1440p 60Hz 1080p 360Hz 1080p 240Hz 1080p 60Hz Something else (let us know in the comments!) Answer See Results That omission continues to be an important one. Like the rest of the RX 6000-series, the RX 6700 XT supports hardware-level ray tracing. At 1440p and 1080p, it can deliver playable frame rates on many games that offer ray tracing, but since many of those titles also support Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, the 6700 XT feels handicapped in comparison. DLSS uses machine learning to intelligently upscale games from lower resolutions to near-native quality, dramatically reducing the performance hit of ray tracing. Since there is little reason not to use DLSS when it\u2019s available, this leaves AMD at a significant performance disadvantage in many RT-enabled games, albeit while maintaining a crisper overall image. AMD has a solution in the works it calls FidelityFX Super Resolution, but as of this writing there\u2019s no firm date or hard details on when that will be available or the performance gains it will be capable of. Turning away from ray tracing, another major feature of the RX 6700 XT is Smart Access Memory. This feature debuted with the RX 6000-series and has the potential to offer meaningful performance boosts to owners of select Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPUs. Smart Access Memory, or SAM for short, allows the CPU to access the 6700 XT\u2019s entire memory pool versus the usual 256 MB, removing a potential rendering bottleneck. That free access allows some games to run more efficiently, leading to increased FPS.  Unfortunately, I was not able to test this for myself since it requires a Ryzen CPU and IGN\u2019s test system is built around an Intel Core i9-9900K. In time, I hope AMD opens up support for Intel processors since Nvidia\u2019s solution, Resizable Bar, is compatible with either. That said, independent testing and AMD\u2019s own marketing materials demonstrate that the benefits are highly dependent on the game in question. Using its figures across nearly a dozen games, the uplift ranged from 4-17% on a Ryzen 9 5900X at 1440p. These results are fairly close to independent testing conducted by TechSpot , so it\u2019s fair to say that the performance enhancements are real but varied. Finally, when it comes to inputs and outputs, the card sports three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and a single HDMI 2.1 capable of 4K120 or 8K60 frame rates. It delivers decoding support for AV1 and VP9 and encoding/decoding support for H.264 and H.265 for every major streaming need.   AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT - Performance With background out of the way, it\u2019s time to get into testing. I run each card through a series of synthetic tests, including several specific to ray tracing, as well as a series of real-world gaming benchmarks. All tests are conducted at ultra settings unless otherwise noted. This allows me to run all cards through the same series of assessments and gauge relative performance and value at different resolutions. One important thing to note is that ray tracing tests are conducted with DLSS enabled on Nvidia cards. It is true that this lends Nvidia cards an advantage over AMD; however, it also represents the exact situation gamers buying these cards today will be faced with. Since so many ray traced games also support DLSS, the question prospective customers will be faced with is whether to opt for Nvidia with RTX and DLSS or AMD at native resolution without. These tests reflect that. When AMD releases its FidelityFX Super Resolution, that feature will also be factored into testing.  AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT - Synthetic Benchmarks   Graphics Card 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra Uniengine Heaven 4.0 (1440p) AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (Rage Mode) 12,317 3725 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 12,105 3671 AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 8,426 2488 Nvidia RTX 3070 Founders Edition 8,547 2785 Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition 7,306 2258  Beginning with synthetic benchmarks, the RX 6700 XT places remarkably close to the RTX 3070. Likewise, it surpasses last generation\u2019s RX 5700 XT by a huge margin. These results offer a very promising first look at the potential of the card.   Graphics Card 3D Mark Port Royal 3DMark Ray Tracing Test AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (Rage Mode) 9107 27.2 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 9054 26.7 AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 5919 13.6 Nvidia RTX 3070 Founders Edition 8,131 31.9 Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition 6,941 25.6  Turning to the ray tracing tests, the tables expectedly turn. These tests are extremely hard on AMD Radeon 6000 series cards. As such, the RX 6700 XT lands where I would expect considering its place in AMD\u2019s line-up: at the bottom of the ladder. Don\u2019t read too much into these results, however, as real-world gaming tests provide a much more accurate picture of the kind of performance you can expect while gaming.  AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT - Gaming Benchmarks After running the card through our initial series of five tests, a few things become clear. First, this is absolutely not a 4K card. It was never promised to be but if you were holding out hope, it\u2019s time to exhale. Second, 1440p and 1080p performance are quite good! Even with ray tracing set to high and without the benefit of DLSS upscaling, it was able to run Metro Exodus at 46 FPS. Lowering settings, it would certainly be possible to push this to 60 FPS. For rasterization, however, this card has no trouble playing games at max settings at this resolution at high refresh rates. AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT Benchmarks 5 Images  The biggest point of comparison is against the RTX 3070 which retails for only $20 more (theoretically). With Metro included in the overall average, the RX 6700 XT lagged behind by 8% at 1080p, 13% at 1440p, and 21% at 4K. With that game excluded to create a better apples to apples comparison, the results are much closer with the RX 6700 XT only lagging behind by 4% at 1080p, 7% at 1440p and 14% at 4K. Remember, also, that my system does not have the advantage of Smart Access Memory, so these results could potentially be even closer.  Compared against AMD\u2019s RX 6800 in all games, the RX 6700 XT was 14% slower at 1080p, 15% slower at 1440p, and 21% slower at 4K. Against the RX 5700 XT, the tables turn in rasterization performance. There, we see the RX 6700 XT offer a massive lead of 32% at 1080p, 35% at 1440p, and 34% at 4K.  With general testing out of the way, I put the RX 6700 XT through a round of expanded testing against a selection of competitive cards: the RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti, and the RX 6800.   At 1440p, the RTX 3070 maintains its lead. When ray tracing and DLSS are factored in, the results lean heavily in favor of Nvidia\u2019s $499 GPU. The RX 6700 XT lags behind by 19 FPS in these results. In sheer rasterization things are much closer with the gap coming in at only 9%. Thanks to DLSS, the RTX 3060 Ti also tops the RX 6700 XT by 10% average across the whole game set. With that removed from the equation, the RX 6700 XT surpasses it by 7%. When compared against the RX 6800, it comes in 15% slower.   At 1080p, things tighten up considerably. Against the RTX 3070 and 3060 Ti, the difference across all titles is only 13% and 3% respectively, even without the benefit of upscaling. In rasterization, the RX 6700 XT beats both cards by 3% and 14%. Against the RX 6800, the gaps remain consistent with 1440p at 12% slower.  Like the RX 6800 and 6800 XT, the RX 6700 XT is a fast gaming GPU and an excellent value for rasterization. With Smart Acif thacess Memory factored in, Ryzen users could find themselves with an extremely competitive card compared to Nvidia. That said, without an answer to DLSS, it underperforms in ray tracing scenarios. That\u2019s a shame because this is a genuinely good card that feels artificially handicapped without an upscaling solution to square off on even footing.  As in the last two Radeon RX 6000 reviews, I found myself wishing AMD had held this launch until FidelityFX Super Resolution was ready. Its release could dramatically change the value proposition. As it stands, if you care about ray tracing and can find a card at MSRP, the RTX 3070 is the better buy. And that\u2019s really the rub: being able to find a GPU at MSRP. While AMD is promising additional stock, only time will tell how that will pan out. If the current GPU marketplace is any indication, these cards will sell out fast and then be resold at exorbitant prices. At their suggested price, most gamers will be better served spending the extra $20 on an RTX 3070, but if you can find the RX 6700 XT at MSRP and the RTX 3070 is still $600-700, then it\u2019s reasonable to accept the modest performance gap and wait on FidelityFX Super Resolution.   Purchasing Guide The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT retails for $479 and you can buy the reference design version of this graphics card direct from AMD , though as with the entire GPU market, we expect stock to be scarce.

        "Content": "Video games based on anime usually go one of two ways: they either try to emulate the anime as closely as possible, beat for beat, or they go their own way to offer something fresh. It\u2019s hard to have that both ways, and Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris\u2019 attempt to pull it off ends badly. Not only does its long-winded visual novel-style recounting of the story become dull and interfere with the intensity of the action, which could\u2019ve thrived if allowed to do its thing, it locks out features as fundamental as co-op and character customization for far too long. On the one hand, there is a lot of faithful adherence to the source material: just as in the latest season of the anime, Kirito finds himself trapped in a Matrix-style virtual world known as Underworld with no way out, and many of the show\u2019s familiar characters, such as Eugeo, are here in full force and fully playable. The premise leads to some clever fourth-wall breaking humor and lots of technical jargon with made up sci-fi terms. For the first third or so of the adventure it follows the anime storyline as a blueprint, although it unfortunately skips over many significant events and retcons several key plot points along the way that would have helped add necessary context in an attempt to make the lore more accessible. Instead, it feels incomplete. So, even though you don\u2019t really need to have seen the anime to follow what\u2019s going on generally, it helps a lot. But even then in some other cases, though, prior knowledge could confuse you because Alicization Lycoris diverges so dramatically. The result is a story that lacks focus and spreads itself too thin. It dives deep into things that didn\u2019t need the extra focus, such as between-quest side character conversations that go on for more than 30 minutes, while glossing over entire arcs of the story in latter portions. There\u2019s also no option for English voiceovers, which is a drag for me personally as someone who prefers to watch the show dubbed. It\u2019s kind of shocking how much time you\u2019re forced to spend reading the story through subtitles. \u201c It\u2019s kind of shocking how much time you\u2019re forced to spend reading the story through subtitles. It\u2019s not uncommon to literally spend five minutes on a quest to kill a monster and then spend the next full hour bouncing between long load screens and 2D character illustrations talking to each other relentlessly. I\u2019m all for character development, but dumping tedious dialogue with descriptions of events that happen off-screen isn\u2019t interesting when they could be shown or experienced instead. These visual novel chapters interrupt the action-RPG side of Alicization Lycoris so frequently that it never settles into a rhythm in either genre. Which is a real shame because actually playing Sword Art Online is engaging. Everything happens in real-time with beautifully flashy art and animation, so even though the fiction is set within an MMO the combat doesn\u2019t feel like one. It\u2019s much more like a traditional action-RPG with fast-paced combat, combos, aerial juggling, and several abilities that can chain together between party members. There\u2019s a big focus on deflecting attacks, then staggering enemies by chaining abilities from multiple characters together. Then, during boss battles, combat completely switches  to a one-versus-one dueling system complete with a new parrying system and locked-on camera. It takes close to 10 hours for all of the tutorials to roll out on how to chain together special attacks, issue commands to AI party members on the fly, and master the various arts and techniques. Until then, the companion AI is nearly useless. They rarely act without being given orders, so experimenting early by triggering combos is very helpful. There is some real complexity here that can take a while to get the hang of, and you\u2019re not really let loose to fully embrace the speed of combat for more than a few minutes at a time until around 15 hours into the roughly 40-hour long adventure. That ramp-up feels excessively long, and it was frustrating that I wasn\u2019t allowed to use my skills for so long even after I felt ready. What's The Best Sword Art Online Storyline? Season 1 Season 2 Season 3: Alicization Season 3: War of Underworld Part 1 Season 3: War of Underworld Part 2 Answer See Results To its credit, Alicization Lycoris absolutely nails the thrill and spectacle of the anime from top to bottom though with its dazzling effects and superb music \u2013 that is, when it\u2019s all working well \u2013 which isn\u2019t often enough. Even with a beefy modern gaming PC that exceeds the recommended specs (Core i5-9600k, GeForce RTX 2060 Super) I had to resort to lowering graphics settings, downgrading from my usual 1440p resolution, locking the framerate at 30fps, and even disabling the Steam overlay to smooth out performance. Before making all of those sacrifices it would take upwards of five minutes at load screens, if not outright freeze and crash between zones, not to mention stuttering and generally poor optimization that was nearly maxing out my GPU. I lost two hours of progress, which was positively blood-boiling. \u201c It doesn\u2019t stop at technical issues, though. At one point around halfway through there is a marathon of two straight hours of cutscenes and boss fights in which you literally go from boss fight to cutscene to boss fight, over and over, without a single save point between them. Dying at the hands of the final boss at the end of the chapter forced me to lose two hours of progress, which was positively blood-boiling. Eventually, once you get past this point, things open up a lot. The frequency of extended uninteresting dialogue scenes is reduced, the freedom in large zones is increased, and generally the pacing evens out a bit. It simply takes far too long to reach the good part. This is also when Alicization Lycoris branches off from the anime, telling its own story. At this point you can tell the reigns start to come off as the structure begins  to loosen up. It feels a bit like the Game of Thrones\u2019 later seasons, where the developers worked from the same source material but arrive at slightly different conclusions from the anime showrunners. That being said, I\u2019d argue the second half of Alicization Lycoris where it becomes its own thing and separates from the anime, is the better half. But you\u2019d be lucky to make it that far without tapping out beforehand. In fact, Alicization Lycoris\u2019 biggest departure is that after 20 hours you suddenly have the ability to alter your character\u2019s appearance entirely, all the way down to your gender. This new avatar can replace Kirito in gameplay (but not cutscenes, oddly) and be used when playing co-op online \u2013 which you also unlock at this point. Random players can join your game if you open up your session, or you can join someone else\u2019s, to go out and complete quests and fight bosses as a party. As a nice touch, everybody also gets permitted one AI companion so you aren\u2019t only leveling up your main character. The decision to block off these two fundamental features for nearly 20 hours is baffling to me. \u201c I have to say, the decision to block off these two fundamental features for nearly 20 hours is baffling to me. If I were buying Alicization Lycoris  for co-op with a friend and found I\u2019d need to sink that much time into it before even unlocking that mode I\u2019d be infuriated, and only being able to customize your character at that point is simply bizarre. The issue with this approach is that it starts to meander from the core premise that kept the plot engaging and devolves into an assortment of unrelated and/or uninspired side stories. In a way, it feels more like an extended post-game rather than an actual continuation of the main storyline."

When we reviewed the Radeon RX 5700 XT (see it on Newegg ), it was clear then that AMD wasn\u2019t out to beat Nvidia in sheer performance but instead by offering an outstanding value for the dollars spent. That appears to be the company\u2019s goal again with the Radeon RX 5500 XT, a budget-oriented card for gamers playing at 1080p. Coming in at $199 for the 8GB version and $169 for the 4GB version, it\u2019s the most affordable RX 5000 card yet, but does it offer the performance boost to warrant an upgrade?   Design and Features Unlike the RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT , there\u2019s no reference version of the RX 5500 XT being sold by AMD itself. That means gamers have their choice of stock models, factory overclocks, and cooling solutions thanks to the plentiful array of choices from add-in board partners (AIBs). It\u2019s a welcome change from the typical months-long delay we\u2019ve seen from both Team Red and Team Green in the past.  The Radeon RX 5500 XT is the third Navi card to hit the market. Like the RX 5700 and 5700 XT, it\u2019s made on the 7nm process, which offers major benefits to power efficiency and performance compared to last generation\u2019s Polaris GPUs. The 5500 XT uses the Navi 14 chip, which is just under 40% smaller than the Navi 10 chip used in the 5700 series. It features 1408 GPU cores and a Base Clock speed of 1607 MHz. Under load, it can spin itself up to 1845 MHz for added performance. It\u2019s available in two memory configurations, 4GB and 8GB GDDR6, the former of which comes in a bit cheaper at $169 versus $199; but with VRAM-hungry games becoming more and more common, it\u2019s worth spending a bit extra for the added 4GB of memory. With a 128-bit bus and a speed of 14 Gb/s, it\u2019s able to process at a rate of 224 Gb/s. As you might imagine with these more modest specs compared to the other cards in the chart above, it sips power with a TDP of only 130w. We completed our testing with the ASRock Challenger version of the card, which joins most others being released with a slight factory overclock. Our version features a slightly enhanced base clock of 1685 MHz and an expected \u201cgame clock\u201d of 1737 MHz over the reference spec of 1717 MHz. These are modest overclocks (as is usually the case for any overclocking with Navi) and shouldn\u2019t have any major impact on performance.  When it comes to display support, the 5500 XT we tested features three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and a single HDMI 2.0b output, though this could vary between models. These outputs allow for high bandwidth connections and open the door to HDR and high resolution, high refresh rate displays (not that this card is a good fit for that in performance). The GPU supports up to 8K video output and AMD Eyefinity for multi-display support. Compared to the 5700 XT, the 5500 XT is a substantially cut back graphics card. AMD\u2019s product page describes the card as capable of \u201cup to\u201d 60 FPS in AAA games and 90 FPS in eSports. The footnotes go on to explain that these figures were taken from Borderlands 3 and Rocket League on High settings, neither of which is the most demanding visually. If the trimmed down hardware weren\u2019t enough, descriptions like that clearly position the 5500 XT as an entry-level Navi gaming card. As a Navi card, the 5500 XT brings with it the same suite of features we found on the 5700 series. Anti-Lag is a competitive favorite as it reduces input lag by synchronizing the processing of the CPU and GPU. Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) is also available to provide an enhanced image by intelligently applying image sharpening only to areas of the image that need it. With its introduction in the 5700 series, I was impressed to see that it elevated 1440p gaming almost to the level of 4K. The same is true here, though to a lesser degree. Still, 1080p with RIS looks crisper than standard 1080p any day of the week.  Performance To test the performance of the card, I ran it through our stable of test games. Each game was set to the ultra presets or highest settings where that wasn\u2019t possible and anti-aliasing was disabled. We are currently in the process of updating our test bench, so the 5500 XT, GTX 1660 , and Radeon RX 590 were each tested in my personal system. It is currently running a Ryzen R7 3900X and 32GB of 3600MHz of G.Skill TridentZ Neo memory and free of any bottlenecks that would hinder performance.    Looking at the results, it\u2019s clear that the cut-down in cores limit the 5500 XT to 1080p unless you\u2019re comfortable gaming under 60 FPS. Even then, the card frequently hovered between 45 and 50 FPS on a number of our comparison titles. Bumping up to 1440p offers gameplay that\u2019s still playable but that is no longer as smooth. If you\u2019re building your first gaming PC , however, it\u2019s worth remembering that many console titles also play in this range, especially when set to favor visuals over frame rate. At 4K, however, things fall apart, as we would expect from a card in this price range. ASRock\u2019s dual-fan cooling solution worked well throughout my testing. I ran my tests in the Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB case outfitted with eight Corsair LL120 fans for exceptional airflow. Even after more than an hour of solid gaming, I recorded a peak temperature of 66C. Again, this will vary depending on your manufacturer but I was impressed at the thermal performance. What\u2019s especially notable here is that the 5500 XT is frequently beaten by last generation\u2019s RX 590. If you\u2019re an optimist, you could look at this positively: you\u2019re getting most of the performance of last generation\u2019s top Radeon card in entry-level Navi. The problem is that the two cards are currently priced identically. Likewise, AMD recently rolled out Radeon Image Sharpening to the RX 590, which means even that benefit isn\u2019t exclusive to this generation. If you\u2019re concerned with sheer FPS for smooth gameplay, the RX 5500 XT falls short. Nvidia\u2019s main competitor to the RX 5500 XT, the GTX 1660, wins in all but a single case that could be chalked up to margin of error. Since the GTX 1660 has been out for a while, it can be had for less than $5 more at the time of this writing, though requires the trade-off of 2GB less VRAM. For only $30 more, the GTX 1660 SUPER promises even bigger performance gains, though I didn\u2019t have one on-hand to test myself for this review.  Purchasing Guide The AsRock version of the Radeon RX 5500 XT we tested is available for $199. There's also a 4GB VRAM variant of this card is also available for $169 .

        "Content": "Has there been a game released in the last 20 years that\u2019s been more influential than Grand Theft Auto III? From its establishment of the open-world sandbox fundamentals to its critical role in reshaping videogames into a more attractive medium for mature audiences, GTA III\u2019s shadow still looms large over almost every facet of the artform. If any game deserved a definitive edition that allowed fans to relive that revolution without squinting to ignore ancient graphics, it\u2019s this. And yet, series creator Rockstar Games has decided to pay tribute to this modern gaming monolith and its two equally acclaimed PS2-era sequels, Vice City and San Andreas, by producing a collection of re-releases that cuts more corners than a Yakuza Stinger in a Liberty City street race. At best this trilogy is ill-conceived and half-finished; at worst it\u2019s straight-up broken. If this half-baked Definitive Edition is anything to go by, I have to wonder if Rockstar reveres its own games as much as the rest of us do. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There are some positives, mind you, but almost every welcome addition is implemented at the cost of some sort of buzz-killing compromise. It seems so antiquated that my original playthroughs with each of these three games were done with a paper map unfurled across my lap, so it\u2019s very convenient that you\u2019re now able to just hit pause to scan the full map of each game world and drop waypoint markers to your destination, like modern gamers would expect. However, you can\u2019t override waypoints that are automatically created during a mission, like if you wanted to take a detour across town to an Ammunation or a Pay \u2018n\u2019 Spray perhaps, and the pathfinding can often get confused as it continually recalculates over the course of a journey, at times resembling something closer to a hastily scribbled signature than the shortest possible route. Similarly, the \u201cGTAV-inspired modern controls\u201d promised in this collection\u2019s marketing have been applied somewhat unevenly over the three individual games. Weapon switching is improved across the board with the ability to use a shoulder button to bring up a weapon wheel, but auto-targeting feels far snappier in San Andreas than in GTA III and Vice City, and while you can circle-strafe while locked on to an enemy with a lighter weapon equipped, heavier machine guns and the like still root you to the spot and force you into a manually aimed first-person perspective regardless. The auto-targeting in GTA III and Vice City proved to be particularly sluggish whenever I found myself up close and personal with a group of enemies, which was fairly frequent given that enemy AI wasn't designed to use cover and just rushes you more often than not. Thus, in both games I found myself increasingly reliant on the use of sniper rifles to thin the herds from a distance rather than run headlong into yet another spasmodic shootout. Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition Screenshots 33 Images A mid-mission checkpointing system has been implemented to good effect in San Andreas, allowing you to restart with all your health and weapons and skip the early setup phase of certain missions. That resolves one of the great complaints of the early games in the 3D series. Yet in GTA III and Vice City, choosing the option to restart at a checkpoint just boots you back to the very start of the mission no matter how deep into it you were when you died. So if, like I did, you die a number of times trying to outrun the cops at the end of the \u2018S.A.M.\u2019 mission in the lead up to GTA III\u2019s climax, you still have to drive from the construction site to the boat jetty, take the boat to the end of the airport runway, wait for the plane to arrive, shoot down the plane with the rocket launcher, collect all the packages, return to the mainland, and then try and escape the police, over and over again. It\u2019s odd that one game allows you to literally cut to the chase while the other two force you to repeatedly bring the car around and warm up the engine first. Grand Theft Autocorrect The new cartoonish character designs have certainly been met with some controversy and mockery among fans, but while I wouldn\u2019t say they look good I don\u2019t have any real issue with them personally. Sure, they all look like a bunch of down and out Disney Infinity dolls, and yes, the Candy Suxxx character model well, kinda sucks, but the only time I ever felt really distracted by them was in the occasional cutscene where characters would be holding objects like pistols or cigarettes in the empty space where their blocky, fingerless fists used to be. Which is the best 3D GTA game of all time? Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto V Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Answer See Results That\u2019s largely the problem with the overhauled graphics in the Definitive Edition; they\u2019re like a shiny new sheet of high-resolution stickers that have been slapped haphazardly on top of an aging LEGO set. They look cleaner on the surface, but there\u2019s no real consistency in how they\u2019ve been applied and everything is still pretty chunky underneath. I don\u2019t pretend to fully understand the technical process involved with taking three games created on the Renderware engine a couple of decades ago and porting them to Unreal Engine 4 in 2021. However, I can only assume due to the comparatively small size of studio Grove Street Games (whose end game credits number at around 30 members of staff), that a lot of the work has been automated, and it shows in a suite of game worlds that are simultaneously sharper than you remember but also noticeably sloppier in terms of their artistic direction and lacking atmosphere. Given how effectively AI upscaling techniques were used to sharpen Mass Effect Legendary Edition\u2019s textures earlier this year, it\u2019s a bit of a shock to see how poorly it\u2019s done here. Even the new lighting system brings mixed results. The neon facades of Vice City\u2019s Ocean Beach district really pop and reflections on cars and puddles are appealing, but elsewhere the overly intense shadows would cast characters into darkness no matter how much I fiddled with the brightness and contrast settings. Although squinting to make out detail in dark areas was still less of a strain on my eyes than the truly torturous rain effect, which made me feel I was being waterboarded with a can of silly string. The truly torturous rain effect, which made me feel I was being waterboarded with a can of silly string. \u201c Meanwhile, an improved draw distance \u2013 which was likely intended to make each environment seem bigger \u2013 has actually had the opposite effect. This is particularly glaring in San Andreas where, coupled with the removal of the Los Angeles-inspired orange smog haze that once concealed the PS2\u2019s technical limitations, you can stand out front of a cabin in Flint County and see the San Fierro skyline looming in the very immediate distance. It completely shatters the convincing illusion of scale that the map was previously able to conjure, and it now feels like wandering around Disney\u2019s Frontierland while having an unobstructed view of Space Mountain. This improved draw distance may also contribute to this collection\u2019s constantly wavering framerate on PS5, which is prone to frequent stuttering whether you opt for fidelity or performance modes. Why you\u2019re even forced to make that choice on a modern console in a collection of games that are each old enough to vote and still don\u2019t look all that good is beyond me. And if you\u2019re playing on Switch (which I have not but others at IGN have) there\u2019s no avoiding the terrible performance. Then there are the bugs, which were waiting to ambush me around every corner like a bunch of game-breaking gangbangers. (For the sake of transparency, I completed every main mission in GTA III and Vice City, and all the main missions in San Andreas up until San Fierro for the purposes of this review.) Hard crashes, frozen cutscenes, NPCs getting caught running in circles, bridges and building exteriors disappearing, and a particularly bizarre morphing texture glitch that has permanently left my CJ in San Andreas resembling Watchmen\u2019s Rorschach are just a few examples of the many rough edges I\u2019ve been exposed to in all three games. All this, I might add, was on PS5 \u2013 by the sounds of it, audiences on PC and Nintendo Switch have had it even worse . I\u2019m assuming that the developer is frantically preparing bug-fixing patches as we speak, but it\u2019s a bit like barring the stable door after the horse has glitched through the wall and exploded. Bless This Mess However, it\u2019s a testament to just how brilliant these games remain, that I still found myself smiling during my replays of the three stories in spite of the many issues. There\u2019s no doubt that the mission design has aged, particularly in GTA III, and creaky limitations like the lack of swimming in both it and Vice City can be tough to reconcile with. But elsewhere, these are video game playgrounds packed with personality and invention and accompanied by incredible soundtracks, even despite a few notable licensed omissions from Vice City and San Andreas that Rockstar has long since lost the rights to include. And they\u2019re just so dense with exceedingly quotable humour, much of which has stayed with me in the years since I first played them. I can\u2019t come home from a night out without telling my wife \u201cYep, I\u2019ve been drinking again.\u201d Oftentimes I can\u2019t get the wah-wahing Giggle Cream jingle out of my head. And I still don\u2019t know why men have nipples. Not only did I enjoy reabsorbing all the hilarious writing, but it was also quite fascinating to sit and play through the three games back to back and relive the rapid evolution of a series (and genre) that would soon become all-conquering. GTA III establishes the blueprint, Vice City refines it and adds weaponised \u201880s nostalgia to its arsenal, and San Andreas expands it in every direction and arguably perfects it, at least given the technology available at the time. There\u2019s no denying the seemingly never-ending commercial success of GTAV, but as far as purely single-player GTA games go, I personally feel that San Andreas might still be the pinnacle. That\u2019s what makes these re-releases such a bitter adrenaline pill to swallow. While these games may have aged too much to be attractive to new players, they are still fun to revisit for existing fans... but this is just far from being the ideal way to experience them. It\u2019s akin to Martin Scorcese announcing a new director\u2019s cut of Goodfellas, but palming off the actual editing work to McG. You\u2019re still getting three iconic GTA games and they\u2019re certainly still playable, but they\u2019re not delivered with anywhere near the level of exacting craftsmanship we\u2019ve grown to expect from Rockstar. I can\u2019t help but wonder how different this re-released collection could have been had the publisher issued talented members of the GTA modding community employment contracts rather than cease and desist letters."

        "Content": "With the arrival of IHRA Drag Racing 2004 on Xbox it instantly became clear to us why this sport has been banished to the wee hours of the morning time slot on your second or third favorite all sports television network. Whereas NASCAR videogames at least give you the periodic thrill of turning left as you make your way around the track, the sport of drag racing keeps it real by only demanding that drivers be able to manipulate a high performance vehicle in a straight line. Right now you're saying to yourself, \"Self, that sure doesn't sound like fun.\" And we're here to tell you both you and yourself are absolutely correct. It's not that IHRA 2004 doesn't capture the essence of the motorsport. It's that there are so many exciting things you can do with an Xbox controller than play an unappealing videogame representation of this sport. There's a reason why most drag racing we've done in videogame to date have been isolated modes built into more full featured big-time racing games like Need for Speed Underground and Test Drive . IHRA 2004 features licensed drivers from the drag racing circuit and real auto manufacturers. It's developed by Super Happy Fun Fun, or SHFF for short. We can't help but be a little disappointed that the company's full name isn't Super Happy Intelligence Team after playing a few hours of IHRA 2004. It's that bad. It's rare that an Xbox game of this era would be handicapped by visuals since Microsoft's machine is capable of pumping out some of the most beautiful graphics on any console. The ugliness of IHRA 2004 is the beginning and end of its problems because we simply can't bear to look at its cars, tracks or game menus for more than a few minutes at a time. We've seen better looking games on Nintendo 64 and PSOne and the playable content was a lot more interesting than drag racing too. To its credit, this is the most accurate presentation of drag racing as far as we can tell because you have to manage your dragster's engine, tires and other tunable elements to give yourself every advantage in events, seasons and single races. Shifting is obviously crucial, because otherwise there'd be nothing to do in this game other than hit the throttle. Learning to line the front wheels of your dragster onto the starting line with perfect precision is like trying to hammer a nail with a pile-driver, it's that tough. Burning rubber and warming up your tires to the proper tackiness is another skill you'll have to master as you get ready to race head to head. We have no doubts that we're getting plenty of drag racing authenticity with this game, it's just not fun and not pretty enough to matchup with other Xbox games. If you happen to get caught in a videogame box tossing fight in your local retailer/videogame rental center and IHRA 2004 ends up ricocheting off of your drooling chin, you'll notice the Xbox Live logo strapped across the top of the box. And we're not talking about the crappy little Xbox Live sticker that showed up on Prince of Persia either. It's the full blooded \"Live Online Enabled,\" which in this case means you can download new dragsters into the game. Mike Janis and Terry McMillen have their dragsters waiting for you out there in Xbox Live download land and that's got to be a good thing. So to recap: IHRA Drag Racing 2004 is bad because of its ridiculously bad graphics, lack of track variety and extremely simple gameplay (because of its adherence to the authenticity of the sport). It's good because there are a lot of cars that shoot fire out of their exhaust pipes, the parachutes that deploy at the end of races and the name of the developer is Super Happy Fun Fun.  Graphics  Blurry and terrible. Most racing games get over visually because there's so little animation with basic car shapes scooting around flat surfaces. These SOBs drive straight so really all you're doing is changing the camera perspective at high speeds. So why in the hell does IHRA 2004 look like a finger-painting flipbook during races? That's a rhetorical question, don't answer. All of the recent technical advancements in videogame graphics like bump-mapping, lens flare or even 32 color paint palettes are totally absent This doesn't look anything like an Xbox game and that's unforgivable.  Sound  The music is about as appealing as the game's visuals. Mullet-rock is alive and well somewhere in the world apparently and that audience must love drag racing. The engine sounds are basic and the disembodied public address announcer sounds like something from a Capcom fighting game. Blech."

I'm affectionately naming the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \u201cThe Beast\u201d because of the way it tore through demanding graphics workloads with ease. The GTX 1080 Ti relies on 12 billion transistors, 3584 CUDA cores, and 11GB of memory to pump out the highest performance of any Nvidia GPU produced to date. The company says that the GTX 1080 Ti is built for 5K resolution and beyond, and my testing at 4K shows that The Beast can handle it.  Let's take a look at the card, the specs, then dive in, shall we?   Striking Style Simply stated, the GTX 1080 Ti is the highest performance Ti card NVIDIA has ever produced. NVIDIA claims that the 1080 Ti yields a 35% performance improvement over the GTX 1080, which is up from the 980 Ti\u2019s 25% improvement over the 980 and the 780 Ti\u2019s 18% improvement over the 780. Also, in the past the Ti versions of the x80 have always been a tiny bit slower than the Titan GPUs also, but this time around Nvidia is claiming the 1080 Ti is actually faster than the Titan X Pascal. This is a bold claim from Nvidia, but as you can see from the spec chart the two GPUs are almost identical. The only differences between the Titan X Pascal and the 1080 Ti are that the new GPU has 1GB less memory, eight less ROPs, and a slightly narrower memory bus. However, it makes up for the difference by using faster memory and higher clock speeds. As far as the missing 1GB of memory goes, Nvidia says 11GB is more than enough for 5k gaming, so it should be enough for quite awhile.

Asus ROG Keris II Ace Michael Higham I tested a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition provided by NVIDIA. The Founders Edition cards are built with premium materials and components and feature a die cast aluminum body. It\u2019s overall a clean look and exactly what I\u2019ve come to expect from NVIDIA. The card is engineered for maximum cool, and maximum cooling. The GTX 1080 Ti will be offered in both Founder's Edition and partner boards from Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, et al, and unlike the GTX 1080 launch, this time both versions of the card will cost the same at $699.  To cool the GP102 GPU Nvidia uses a copper vapor chamber combined with a large dual-slot aluminum heatsink. Heat is exhausted off the chip through the back of the card and out of the PC chassis, aka a \"blower\" style cooler. The DVI connector has been removed from the back of the card in order to provide a larger exhaust. According to Nvidia this results in double the airflow over previous versions. Our overclocked card ran quite hot and we recorded temperatures up to 140 degrees F on the exposed back of the card. The card also includes a grooved backplate that can be removed with two GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cards are paired in SLI to improve airflow and cooling.  The Beast is Built for Speed The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is built with 3584 CUDA Cores, 28 Steaming Multiprocessors (SMs), and runs at a base clock frequency of 1480 MHz while it can be boosted to 1582 MHz. The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti uses 224 texture units to provide a whopping 354.4 Gigatexels/sec texture filtering rate when overclocked. For comparison to the last gen, that's 85% higher than the GTX 980 Ti, if you can believe that. Another performance improvement is the addition of GDDR5X memory modules running at 11Gbps. This is a bit faster than the modules in both the Titan X and the GTX 1080, which both run at 10Gb/s. When combined with the GTX 1080 Ti\u2019s 352-bit memory interface, peak memory bandwidth maxes out at an incredible 484 GB/s. To further improve memory performance, NIVIDIA uses Tile Caching, which first appeared in the Maxwell architecture, to improve cache locality and reduce memory traffic. The combination of tile caching and compression techniques almost triples the effective memory bandwidth of the GTX 1080 Ti. Benchmarks To test the GTX 1080 Ti, I installed it in a test system IGN built that's comprised of an Intel Core i5 4670K @ 3.40GHZ, 8GB of RAM, and a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500GB running 64-bit Windows 10. We tested on an Acer XB280HK 4K monitor and ran all games and benchmarks in full screen mode. In all of my tests I ran the games at 3840x2160 resolution and maxed out graphics quality, running settings labeled as Very High, Ultra, Extreme etc. Though I didn't have a bunch of older Nvidia GPUs to compare it to, I was able to secure an overclocked MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8G, which is a very good representation of what the fastest GTX 1080s are capable of doing. I didn't include benchmark results for the GTX 1070, since they were taken on a different system with an older driver, but you can examine them here for reference .  The Beast kicked ass and took no prisoners, even though we only tested it on a moderately equipped gaming PC. The GTX 1080 Ti blew away any other single card we\u2019ve tested, and not just as an incremental improvement. It felt like The Beast was taunting us as we performance tested it, slowly raising its hand and extending a vertical palm as if to say to our massive and overclocked reference card, \u201coh please\u201d.  Heaven 4.0 results were insane, almost doubling the performance of the Titan X (Maxwell) and beating the GTX 1080 by more than 25%. At 4K resolution, the GTX 1080 Ti ripped through Heaven 4.0 at 51.2 FPS, dropping to a minimum of 8 FPS and hitting a whopping maximum of 122.6 FPS. Dropping the resolution in Heaven 4.0 to a mere 2560x1600, The Beast shredded Heaven 4.0 at 119.5 FPS (min of 32.5 FPS and max of 258.3 FPS). I continued to see a 25%-plus improvement over the GTX 1080 in all our testing.

Sapphire Radeon RX 590 Nitro josh norem The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti handled everything I threw at it with aplomb. Gaming with it was a treat. Rise of the Tomb Raider was a completely fluid experience with all graphics options maxed out, even at 4k resolution. The shadows, lighting, and particle effects were enthrallingly smooth. Likewise, Batman: Arkham Knight was an epic visual adventure that brought detailed textures and lighting to bear with remarkable fluidity and grace. Overclocking At the press launch for the GTX 1080 Ti Nvidia stated that although the card's Boost Clock is a modest 1.6GHz, gamers could expect to hit 2GHz with some overclocking, so we tried our hand at it. Not surprisingly, I was able to hit 2GHz but it wasn't quite stable as I could see some artifacting flickering on the screen around 2012MHz. Going up to 20150MHz was possible but it caused the driver to crash every time, so I backed it down to 1,987MHz and it was very stable. The only fly in the ointment was it hit 84 degrees Celsius pretty quickly in testing so I had to turn up the fan a bit to get it to achieve a higher overclock, and the single fan in the blower-style cooler is loud. It's really the only knock on what is an otherwise flawless GPU, and it's one I'm sure Nvidia's partner's will rectify with two-and-three fan cooling setups. Though the Founder's Edition card ran very well overall, I can't help but think it'll be able to run at 2GHz much quieter with a beefier cooling apparatus.  Where Because the GTX 1080 Ti is a brand new release, and because it takes claim as the fastest video card on the market, it's pretty hard to find it in stock as of this moment. The two best places to check online are Amazon and Newegg. I've compiled a list of all the GTX 1080 Ti variants that have popped up in the wild.

        "Content": "The Crytek Studios-developed first-person shooter Far Cry was released for the PC format in early 2004 and the game instantly blew players away with state of the art graphics and a wide open tropical battlefield to explore. Since that time, new iterations of the Far Cry franchise have shown up on major home consoles, from PlayStation 2 and Xbox to, more recently, Xbox 360. And now Ubisoft has readied a Wii incarnation of the series, Far Cry Vengeance , as a first wave title. The Wii build successfully capitalizes on Nintendo's innovative remote, enabling a comfortably high level of control speed and accuracy as gamers run and gun down opponents in the jungles and in the surrounding waters. But just as Far Cry initially set a new graphic high on PC, so does it set a new graphic low on Wii, with visuals so blurry, smeary, sluggish and ugly that you'll question whether the title could realistically run on Nintendo 64. Far Cry Vengeance for Wii is a mishmash of Instincts and Evolution with new additions, such as a modified storyline, exclusive maps and weapons, and Wii controller functionality. The title follows ex-military guru Jack Carver, whose mysterious past has somehow familiarized him with a variety of dangerous weapons and allowed him to unexplainably use feral powers to become part man-massacring beast when the situation calls for it. The Far Cry franchise will probably not be remembered for its compelling storytelling, but previous games did use real-time graphics well to set a mood. However, the Wii version begins with a jarringly compressed and blurry cinematic that should be running in real-time, but isn't. The first time we laid eyes on it, we thought that our test television had malfunctioned and we checked the settings, but alas, it's a software shortcoming. Sadly, the in-engine visuals don't look much better, if at all, which is Vengeance's biggest disappointment.  Carver meets with a voluptuous arms dealer and travels with her to a tropical location when some mercenaries attack, and the action rarely relents from that point forward. Wii owners can take solace in the fact that Ubisoft has really utilized Nintendo's controller. The standard configuration is too slow for our liking, but the sensitivity settings can be increased so that you can turn and aim quickly; and you can press and hold the A button to lock the screen so that you can aim GoldenEye style. Within a matter of minutes, you will find yourself easily navigating the vegetation-filled environments while effortlessly disposing of enemies with one-hit headshots. As we played through the title, we often wondered why the Far Cry team didn't communicate with the Red Steel one, because had Ubisoft's exclusive shooter had Far Cry's control accuracy and speed it would have been a much better game. That being true, not all is well with the Wii functionality. Oddly, you'll have to flip the nunchuk up to make your character jump and in our experience the process feels clumsy and forced. Worse is that you'll have to thrust the controller forward as it's done in Red Steel to zoom in on enemies with the sniper rifle or any other weapon. We didn't like the option in Red Steel and it's considerably less intuitive in Far Cry.  Even with these control gripes, moving about the environments and gunning down mercenaries feels quick and responsive. Vengeance is, like its predecessors, an action-filled first-person shooter so if you favor FPSs like Doom or even Halo to efforts like Rainbow Six then you will undoubtedly also enjoy this undertaking. The game world is enormous and it's filled with enemies to shoot, weapons to pick up, and vehicles to ride in. You've got everything from a machete (you simply shake the Wii remote forward to slice and dice at any time, even if you're already holding a gun), a 9mm, Bull44, shotgun, G18, AM9, MP5, Auto45, Carbine, assault rifle, BC-74, sniper rifle, grenades, and yes, even rocket launcher. The sheer variety is commendable and the ability to drive everything from an RMV to a patrol boat breaks up the monotony of running through foliage and shotgun-blasting foes. But how much fun you ultimately have with the game will be directly related to how forgiving you are of its many technical and content related inadequacies. Easily the biggest offender is the visual presentation, which we only touched upon earlier in the review. The awful graphics unfortunately do not stop with the cut sequences. Upon booting Vengeance, one truth becomes immediately visible: this game was rushed. Wii is theoretically more powerful than Xbox, but it doesn't have the pixel shading benefits of Microsoft's first generation hardware. Despite the fact that it has released more than a year after Instincts, Vengeance doesn't even look half as good -- and we're not exaggerating. The game world is overrun with textures so blurry and low-res that they would have been laughable had they appeared on GameCube, let alone Wii. Pop-up and draw-in deficiencies are everywhere. You will see grass sprouting up 10 feet in front of you as you walk about. You will see entire trees popping into existence close by. The lighting effects in previous games are gone. We're not suggesting that we can't live without HDR lighting, but some real-time sources would have been nice.  Fire off a rifle in a darkened hallway and it won't even light up the area. The widespread foliage in previous incarnations has been dumbed down and looks hideously pixelated as you walk through it. The franchise's trademark outside bloom effects are nearly nonexistent and extremely subtle when they are used. The particle effects for blood and fire are primitively implemented. And what of the gorgeous shimmering waters from Vengeance's predecessors? It's all been replaced by crummy looking liquid - and if you actually dive underneath, it's all so foggy that you may as well be playing the original Turok.  Amazingly, despite all of these technical drawbacks, Far Cry Vengeance cannot even cling to a smooth framerate. The title runs sporadically at 30 frames and usually well below. There are times, especially during big explosions, where the fluidity will chug to a slide-show crawl. And that is simply inexcusable given all the shortcuts Ubisoft has already taken to get the franchise on Wii for the first wave. On one positive note, the game does at least support both 480p and 16:9 display modes. The rush-job unfortunately transcends the title's graphics and journeys into some of the logic, too. For example, the enemy artificial intelligence - an area commonly praised in Far Cry games of old - is borderline stupid in Vengeance. Foes will completely ignore nearby gunfights and explosions. You'll be able to repeatedly walk up behind enemies and cap them in the head. And during intense fights, some gunmen will stop in their tracks and simply stare in your direction. More troublesome, however, is that on several occasions we managed to run through the perimeter of a level and then found our character hovering between this world and the next\u2026 or maybe it was the Matrix. Other Far Cry staples, including a robust multiplayer mode and a map editor, have both been sacrificed, if not slashed completely from the Wii version. Vengeance features only a two-player split-screen mode that is as fundamentally flawed as the single-player experience. And the map editor - an option that would have helped extend replay value, just as it has for Konami's Elebits - is altogether gone. Shame, as WiiConnect24 is practically designed for such an addition.  "

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is arguably your best option. Laden with real-world, high-tech gadgetry and \"it could happen\" global conflicts setting the stage, Splinter Cell has carved out its own path in the genre, admirably competing neck and snapped neck with Solid Snake's exploits.   Those are some strong legs.   Ubisoft has rereleased the first three games in the series with an HD upgrade in the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Trilogy for PlayStation 3. The trilogy is available both as a retail package that offers all three games on one Blu-ray disc or as a downloadable PSN bundle, both with added support for trophies.  Instead of focusing on each individual game in the franchise, this review will deal with the collection as a whole, what it offers to fans of the series, and most importantly, what it doesn't.  As soon as you pop the disc in your system, you must perform a mandatory 5.5 GB install onto your hard drive. Sit tight, grab an icy cold beverage and surf IGN; this will take around twenty minutes or so.  The HD presentations of each game make up the real meat and potatoes of the Trilogy's updates. All three games are presented in 1080p (although Chaos Theory does require some XMB finagling to get it to display in 1080p instead of 720p).  Unfortunately, aside from simply upping the resolution, the conversion team didn't do much to update the games at all. The first Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow haven't aged very well, and what were once phenomenal lighting effects appear pretty poor by today's standards. While that may be forgivable at the onset, the framerate stutters consistently throughout the first two games. All in all, it doesn't look like anyone cared to add extra oomph to the visual presentation.  While the original game and Pandora Tomorrow look like a murky, choppy mess, Chaos Theory actually looks pretty good. The framerate remains solid in this port, and the lighting effects still hold up, making this the technical standout of the pack.   Stop choking yourself. Stop choking yourself.  However, even though Chaos Theory is far and away the best of the bunch graphically, the game commits a fatal sin \u2013 the complete lack of multiplayer. Same goes for Pandora Tomorrow, which originally offered up a competitive multiplayer mode that pitted stealth players against well-armed mercenaries, while Chaos Theory featured a spin on the aforementioned mode as well as a set of great co-op stealth missions. Tragically, neither game offers what made them so unique in the first place.  In place of a really compelling multiplayer element, we get 3D support. While the effect looks cool at times (notably when you have your night-vision goggles activated), the framerate takes even more of a dive when activated. Any benefits that 3D may offer become negated when the on-screen action gets too jittery, so even if you have the setup to take advantage of this added perk, I suspect most players will turn it off before too long.",

        "Content": "On a fundamental level, Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s Switch port is totally fine. It runs at a relatively consistent 60 frames per second, both in docked and handheld modes; (almost) every mode present in the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC versions are accounted for; and even though a ton of sacrifices were made on the visual side to make it run on Nintendo\u2019s substantially less powerful hardware, few if any of them affect the actual fighting gameplay. That being said, there are numerous absolutely puzzling differences between the Switch version and its more powerful brethren, leading to a port that is in many ways better than expected, but at the same time, worse than it should be. Before we dive in, make sure to read my Mortal Kombat 11 review for the console versions to get an idea of what it's like at its best, because this review will largely focus on the technical differences between those and the Switch version.  The Switch version was co-developed by Netherrealm and Shiver Entertainment, and it definitely feels like something was lost in translation. The Krypt has wildly different pricing on its treasure chests, with just about every chest costing an absurdly large amount of koins compared to the other versions. It takes Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s already shaky in-game economy and makes it even more out of whack.  Even at its base level, Mortal Kombat 11 is an absolutely gorgeous game. \u201c The general graphics look expectedly worse, but even at its base level Mortal Kombat 11 is an absolutely gorgeous game and a lot of that does come through on the Switch version. It runs at a mostly steady 60FPS; character models look great, albeit a bit fuzzy; and the stellar art design stands out even on the substantially less powerful hardware. Instead of the characters, the biggest sacrifices made to the visuals were mostly in the look of the stages. Environments look low-res, with muddy textures and extremely basic lighting effects. Also, the Krypt looks like an absolute mess, with PlayStation One-era fog and a complete lack of a skybox.  Beyond pure looks, the character-specific tutorials are missing (there\u2019s a placeholder that says \u201cComing Soon\u201d), moves that can do a Krushing Blow have their requirements left out of the movelist for some reason, and the competitive variations for each character in both Tournament mode and Ranked are missing, with the variations in tournament simply replaced by a generic variation that just says \u201cDefault.\u201d   Of all the main modes in Mortal Kombat 11, it\u2019s the Story mode that translates over to the Switch the best, but even then, it\u2019s not quite as nice. The transition from cutscene quality to gameplay is jarring because of the sudden switch in character model and texture quality, and then the transition back from gameplay to cutscene is almost always followed by substantial hitching in the video framerate for a few moments.  The \u201calways-online\u201d requirement hits the Switch version especially hard. \u201c It\u2019s the \u201calways-online\u201d requirement, though, that hits the Switch version especially hard. An appealing aspect of Mortal Kombat 11 on the Switch is the ability to play it on the go, but because several of its tentpole modes are only playable online, playing outside of wifi range feels especially hamstrung. Without a stable online connection, you are completely unable to play both Towers of Time and the Krypt, the two modes that are basically required in order to obtain the currency needed to unlock Mortal Kombat 11\u2019s enormous vault of skins, gear pieces, fatalities, brutalities, and more. It\u2019s the exact kind of thing I\u2019d want to grind out on a train ride.  Every IGN Mortal Kombat Game Review 39 Images  When you\u2019re connected, online play through the Nintendo Online service is mostly great, though it\u2019s notably less smooth than on the other platforms.

        "Content": "For a game with such a big world, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas starts in a pretty personal place. In the first mission, Carl Johnson silently mourns his recently deceased mother. Thanks to the upgraded textures and higher resolution (all the way up to 720p!), I could see pain in his face that wasn't apparent a decade ago. In the second, CJ reunites with his estranged brother and sister, but the audio cut out after a few seconds, interrupting the bittersweet moment. That's a pretty good encapsulation of what this re-release of San Andreas brings to the table: it\u2019s the same great story and setting, bolstered by relatively sharp visuals but also hamstrung by new technical issues. Just about every Grand Theft Auto since the series went 3D attempts to mix emotion with carnage and comedy, but none has nailed the balance as well as San Andreas. Carl Johnson's adventure has plenty of betrayal and redemption, but there's plenty of good-natured ribbing amongst friends as well as offbeat interactions with some of the city's weirder inhabitants, like a weak-willed hardcore rapper and a conspiracy spouting hippie. The range of activities also runs the gamut; while the running, gunning, and driving of previous GTAs is still at the heart of San Andreas, the amount of physical activities, minigames, and gambling just a short drive away is still impressive today. Most extracurricular activities are quickly introduced and rarely overstay their welcome, save San Andreas' insistence on making CJ's health reliant on side activities like working out and visiting restaurants. It's worth noting that this is the first Xbox version of San Andreas to incorporate Achievements, so if notifications and meta-points happen to give you additional motivation, you might find additional reason to explore, experiment, and complete the campaign. When it comes to that campaign, San Andreas is a bit less of a hassle than it used to be. While the auto-aiming system remains as troublesome as ever and some of the missions you'll have to complete can be amongst the series' hardest (particularly the train-chasing sequence with Big Smoke, and Zero's maddening RC helicopter escapades), but a new checkpoint system allows for immediate retries after a failed mission. The two key benefits are that you don't need to worry about the loss of weaponry and armor that comes with being arrested, or endure the sometimes-long \u201cdrive of shame\u201d back to the mission marker. In a few cases, you can even pick up midway through an objective. Those cases are rarer than they should be, however given how long some missions run, boring drives from the mission start point still happen far too frequently. Even though it's a far cry from the retry-friendly checkpoints in GTA V, San Andreas' system is way better than it was a decade ago. The same can't be said about the UI, which has been directly lifted from the iOS version of San Andreas. Finding a particular bit of info, whether it be a stat, option, or objective takes an extra button press than before (whereas you'd previously just scroll through the categories and see the information), and the map is confusingly omnipresent, but the menu buttons and can't be moved until you activate it with the back button. You'll have to do that often, as the static section of the map rarely fits in enough of the world to discern a proper path to your destination amongst San Andreas' entwined highways and loopy dirt roads.

While improved textures make the world more vibrant, signs more readable, and characters (slightly) less puppet-like, you'll have to deal with a surprisingly choppier framerate. It's usually manageable, only really manifesting when the camera is moved around quickly or too many cars are on the road, but it can become distracting when it plays out during action sequences. There's also that issue of audio suddenly muting during cutscenes roughly 10 percent of the time, which is stranger than the graphical issues since San Andreas' epic soundtrack and star-studded vocal performances haven't been altered."

        "Content": "The wait is finally over: Navi 2.0 is here. I\u2019ve spent the last week putting the Radeon RX 6800 XT and RX 6800 through their paces to see how they stack up against our stable of last generation graphics cards and Nvidia\u2019s RTX-3000 Series. In this article, I\u2019ll be focusing on the RX 6800 XT but be sure to check out our separate RX 6800 review as well. Coming to market at $649, the RX 6800 XT undercuts the price of the Nvidia RTX 3080 \u2013 but does it have the performance to stack up? AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT Review 8 Images  AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2013 Design and Features If it weren\u2019t for the branding, I would think the Radeon RX 6800 XT was a third-party card. Compared to last generation\u2019s AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, it\u2019s bigger and looks better, throwing out the blower-style cooler for a triple fan design and a 2.5-slot heatsink. At 267x120mm, is a far cry from the case-challenging Nvidia RTX 3090 and should fit in most mid-tower PC cases with ease. Visually, it\u2019s a major upgrade from the minimalist 5700 XT and looks equal parts spaceship and muscle car. I like it. Which AMD Graphics Card are you getting? AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT AMD Radeon RX 6800 An older AMD GPU Team Green FTW! Answer See Results Of course, looks only go so far. What really matters is what that heatsink is keeping cool. The RX 6800 XT is built on AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture. Like the RX 5700 XT, it uses AMD\u2019s 7nm process, but the transistor count has more than doubled, going from 10.3 billion to 26.8 billion. With that, the GPU has received a massive expansion in Stream Processors, which are responsible for game rendering. Last generation\u2019s 5700 XT featured 2560 SPs, while the 6800 XT bumps that all the way to 4608. Likewise, it features 72 Compute Units, up from 40 last-gen, and each has its hardware level ray tracing unit (which we\u2019ll get to shortly). It marries that with 16GB of GDDR6 memory (topping all but the RTX 3090 from Team Green) on a 256-bit bus bearing a total bandwidth of 512 GB/s.  If you recall from my review of the RTX 3080 Founders Edition, the RX 6800 XT\u2019s main competitor, this memory configuration isn\u2019t as fast. The RTX 3080 uses the cutting edge GDDR6X and offers a maximum memory bandwidth of 760 GB/s. If we go down a step to the RTX 3070, we find a much more \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison since it is also running GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus. There, the 6800 XT is substantially faster than the RTX 3070\u2019s 448 GB/s. In other words, this Navi GPU has faster memory than you might expect from GDDR6, but it still doesn\u2019t compare well to the G6X in the RTX 3080. In real world terms, I wasn\u2019t able to notice any difference while gaming, but it\u2019s worth being aware as game engine development continues to advance. The guaranteed clock speeds are impressive, though as we\u2019ve seen with cards for a number of years, they really only hint at what the cards may achieve. The Radeon 6800 XT offers a \u201cGame Clock\u201d of 2015 MHz and a Boost Clock of up to 2250 MHz. AMD\u2019s Radeon Software comes also with several presets, including the much anticipated Rage Mode (which raises the power limits on the card), and an automatic overclocking option that removes the legwork from figuring out a stable, notched up frequency. Even without those, I was surprised to see what the card was capable of. Loading up a game with complete stock speeds, the RX 6800 XT immediately ramped up to 2400 MHz and pushed just shy of 2500 MHz with Rage Mode engaged. Compared to the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080, which would maybe hit 2 GHz without a manual overclock, you can see how impressive that speed boost is.  Before moving into the architecture, you should also know that the card features one HDMI 2.1 output and two DisplayPort 1.4 with integrated Display Stream Compression (DSC) for running high performance gaming monitors . It also includes a USB Type-C output for easily connecting virtual reality headsets .  RDNA 2: The New Architecture To really understand the RX 6000 series and how the specs above come into play, we have to dig a little deeper into what\u2019s going on within the chip itself. RDNA 2 is a big leap forward for AMD and offers real world benefits for gamers. AMD quotes 1.54x performance per watt compared to last-gen and up to 1.3x higher frequency. What that means, in essence, is that watt for watt the RX 6000 series is going to kick out more frames at a higher frequency than the original RDNA architecture was capable of. One of the ways it accomplishes this is through its brand new store of Infinity Cache. Both the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT feature 128 MB of rapid access, on-die storage that increases the bandwidth of the built-in video memory. Rather than have to draw on the VRAM, RDNA2 maintains a pool of important data on the GPU itself for near-immediate access, and actively maintains it to reduce latency. This accounts for a share of the gains I introduced previously, but is also more energy efficient, reducing the overall power demands of the card as a whole. Likewise, it\u2019s a primary reason for the incredible clock speeds the card is able to offer.  If that name sounds familiar, it should. Infinity Cache is directly related to the Infinity Fabric found on AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs. More than any generation before it, the RX 6000 series draws on the connection between CPU and GPU for elevated performance. As a result, there\u2019s a real benefit to running a new AMD CPU along with your RX 6000-series GPU. AMD leverages this synergy with a technology it calls Smart Access Memory. By running both AMD components on the AMD 500-series platform, your Ryzen CPU is able to directly access all 16GB of the 6800 XT\u2019s memory. AMD claims an average FPS improvement of 6% with results that can go as high as 15% in Forza Horizon 4 at 1440p. Since our test platform is based on the Intel i9-9900K, I wasn\u2019t able to test these for myself, but based on the performance results I saw, even a 6% improvement does well to close the gap between or even beat the RTX 3080 in some titles.  Enabling Ray Tracing One of the biggest curiosities leading up to this launch was how the RX 6000 series would handle ray tracing. While Nvidia features a whole separate \u201cRT Core\u201d in its RTX architecture, RDNA 2 instead bakes ray tracing into its existing Compute Units with new Ray Tracing Accelerators. Each CU features a single Accelerator, so every clock cycle \u2013 up to 70 of them \u2013 can be leveraged for four ray tracing intersections each. This performance is also enhanced by the Infinity Cache and is further enhanced you have the CPU , GPU, and motherboard synergy above with Smart Access Memory. Even with those enhancements, trying to run ray traced games at 4K is a tall order, even for the best gaming GPUs. Nvidia accomplishes this with the help of its AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology to intelligently upscale games to higher resolutions without the same performance penalty. At launch, AMD has no answer for this technology, which means ray tracing at a particular resolution is much more taxing than those that support DLSS with Nvidia (which, to be fair, is still a fairly small, yet growing, number). AMD did share that gamers can expect a solution to come \u2013 a technology they call FidelityFX Super Resolution, but there is very little known about it or when it may actually release.  In the gaming landscape today, it\u2019s still a minority of games that support ray tracing, but since Nvidia was first out of the gate, many of those that do also support DLSS. Apples to apples, AMD\u2019s RX-6000 series is at a significant disadvantage in these cases as DLSS will allow Nvidia\u2019s RTX cards to run at much higher frame rates, even at 4K. As you\u2019ll see, enabling ray tracing at this resolution often drops frame rates well below 60 FPS. In many cases, games are still playable but aren\u2019t nearly as smooth. This isn\u2019t the case at 1440p, and the RX 6800 XT does an admirable job of enabling no-sacrifices gameplay at that resolution. Given that, it\u2019s worth taking a close look at how you want to play, and how long you may need to wait for FidelityFX Super Resolution if 4K with ray tracing is on your list of must-haves. That said, I remain impressed at the impact of Radeon Image Sharpening, which algorithmically applies a sharpening filter but only to the areas of the screen that need it. This technology was highlighted as part of the RX 5700 XT launch and has since gone mostly under the radar. Gaming at 1440p with ray tracing on and Radeon Image Sharpening enabled isn\u2019t quite 4K, but it is an improvement over normal 1440p without a major FPS loss. The other thing to know is that the Radeon RX 6000 series uses Microsoft\u2019s DXR platform, not RTX. That means, games designed specifically for RTX ray tracing will not automatically work with DXR cards like the RX 6800 XT. While that might seem obvious, that does mean that some games that can do ray tracing won\u2019t do ray tracing with these cards, such as Wolfenstein: Youngblood . That said, in the roster of games I had available to test, Wolfenstein was the only one that had this issue.  Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Boost, Content Creation This launch isn\u2019t all about hardware, though, as AMD has a couple of neat software tricks up its sleeve and some real highlights for streamers and content creation. The first is a technology called Radeon Anti-Lag and can work in conjunction with its second, Radeon Boost. Together, they aim to reduce input latency, improve performance and make games feel more responsive. Radeon Anti-Lag works by controlling the pace of CPU tasks to better sync with GPUs in graphics-card-limited scenarios. By its design, this can have a minor impact on frame rate (several frames a second) but in my testing does make games feel more responsive. I\u2019m far from a competitive gamer, so the fact that it\u2019s perceptible even to me bodes well for competitive gamers in hardware-limited scenarios. Radeon Boost, on the other hand, dynamically adjusts your resolution to increase performance. Unlike the resolution scaling you might be familiar with from console implementations, Boost only kicks in during bursts of motion when you\u2019re unlikely to perceive any difference in visual quality. This improves overall performance, and when used in conjunction with Radeon Anti-Lag, makes competitive gaming feel more fluid and responsive. With little to no visual difference, there\u2019s little reason not to use these features if you enjoy twitch shooters and need the lowest input possible. Finally, the RX 6000 Series also brings with it the most recent codecs for streamers and content creators. In addition to traditional H.264, it also features H.265/HEVC and AV1 decoding for reduced bandwidth, higher quality game streaming.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2013 Performance  Test system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply. Now that we have a better understanding of the card itself, let\u2019s take a closer look at how it performs. All tests were performed at ultra settings to determine how the RX 6800 XT performs under pressure. In contrast to our prior GPU reviews, I have expanded ray tracing testing to include 1440p in a wide variety of tests to better demonstrate the different levels of expected performance. Since Rage Mode was highlighted as a gateway to improved performance, I included tests with Rage Mode enabled as a separate entry. I tested this preset at 4K only due to time and to examine the impact it would have in the most challenging scenarios. As I mentioned previously, our test system is built on the Intel Z390 platform, so we were unable to take advantage of Smart Access Memory. If you\u2019re gaming on a system that does have that hardware, your results will likely be slightly higher than what I was able to document.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2013 Synthetic Benchmarks   Starting with our synthetics tests, the Radeon RX 6800 XT performed very well, topping the charts in Fire Strike and coming in second to the much more expensive Nvidia RTX 3090 Founders Edition in Heaven. These are rasterization tests, however, and don\u2019t engage each card\u2019s ray tracing capabilities so I turned to a series of additional benchmarks to see how it would stack up there.   The Ray Tracing tests begin to tell a different tale. 3DMark\u2019s Port Royal tests find the RX 6800 XT falling short of the RTX 3090 and 3080 while still maintaining a lead over the RTX 3070. In Surgical Scalpels\u2019 Boundary benchmark, the lack of DLSS support puts the RX 6800 XT at less than half the FPS of even the RTX 3070. It fares a little better in 3DMark\u2019s Ray Tracing Test, but still falls short of any of the RTX cards. Synthetics are good for comparing GPUs, but don\u2019t necessarily say much about actual gameplay performance. Let\u2019s see how it did in gaming benchmarks. AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2013 Gaming Benchmarks 5 Images Here\u2019s where things get interesting. To say that it leapfrogs last generation\u2019s RX 5700 XT is an understatement. In the games above, the RX 6800 XT explodes the frame rate at every resolution. FPS is 66% higher at 1080p, 77% higher at 1440p, and 81% higher at 4K. Generation over generation, that\u2019s simply phenomenal; however, given that this is a 6800 XT and last generation topped out at 5700 XT, it\u2019s possible we might see a more apt comparison in the future. For now, this is what we have and the results are extraordinary. Compared to the RTX 3080, the RX 6800 XT is surprisingly competitive. It trades blows across games and resolutions. The RTX 3080 maintains the overall lead, but often by such a margin that it\u2019s unlikely to be perceived during actual gameplay. That said, without an equivalent to DLSS, ray tracing performance is much lower, as evidenced in Metro: Exodus. There, the RX 6800 XT delivered 65 FPS at 1440p but dropped to 35 at 4K. By contrast, the RTX 3080 offered 89 FPS at 1440p and 64 at 4K. Even without upscaling, the RX 6800 XT still surpassed the RTX 3070 at both 1440p and 4K resolutions. Let\u2019s take a look at 4K in particular with a wider variety of games.   For these tests, I narrowed down the focus to the current generation of 4K cards, excluding the RTX 3090 which is in an entirely different tier of price and performance. With this expanded selection of games, some ray traced and some not, several things become clear. First, when we look at pure rasterization, the RX 6800 XT is a beast. In default mode, it averages only 4% slower than the RTX 3080 (3% with Rage Mode enabled). Try to play something with ray tracing enabled without DLSS and the gap becomes a chasm. Remember, most games supporting RTX today also support DLSS. Without that feature, the RX 6800 XT is 40% slower on those games and 18% behind the RTX 3070. The exception to this is the recently-released Dirt 5 which does not have DLSS and performed much better on the RX 6800 XT. Those numbers are both surprising and promising, so if this is an example of things to come, then maybe this won\u2019t be an issue at all. Without a crystal ball there is no way to tell for certain. Looking at the entirety of our test roster, however, the RX 6800 XT was 23% slower than the RTX 3080 but 3% faster than the RTX 3070. Rage Mode offers a performance improvement, but it\u2019s small at only 1% on average \u201c The other thing to note here is that Rage Mode does offer a performance improvement, but it\u2019s small at only 1% on average. At the same time, since the cooler is able to keep the card well within safe limits and it doesn't result in much if any additional noise, there\u2019s not a lot of reason not to have it on unless you plan to overclock. So what can we take from this? First off, if you don\u2019t care about ray tracing, the RX 6800 XT is an excellent way to game at 4K while also saving money. I would also consider this card if you\u2019re currently at 1440p and looking to upgrade in the future. At that resolution, it can deliver 60+ FPS at ultra settings even with DXR enabled. While you\u2019re waiting to make the resolution jump, AMD should be well on the path to delivering its own scaling solution. If you\u2019re already gaming at 4K and do care about ray tracing, this probably isn\u2019t the card for you. At least not yet.   AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2013 Thermals and Acoustics When it comes to temperature, AMD bases its throttling on a relatively high junction temperature (the hottest spot on the die) of 110C. The GPU temperature, on the other hand, is the figure we typically look at, which often lags behind the junction temperature. This is important because even though the RX 6800 XT runs fairly hot at 89C peak in our testing, the junction temperature never reached its 110C throttle point while gaming. Even after hours of benchmark testing, it was able to maintain a clock rate in the 2400 MHz range, which is impressive. Still, 89C is hot for a high airflow case like my Lian Li LanCool II and this is dramatically higher than the 69C average I observed on the RTX 3080. With its triple fan solution, the Radeon RX 6800 XT generates more noise than Nvidia\u2019s current RTX line-up. It\u2019s not loud, but did overtake my case fans slightly, clearly allowing me to hear when the GPU would spin up. Given the revised temperature load, it\u2019s clear to see that AMD has carefully balanced acoustics with thermal performance and has done well walking the line.  Purchasing Guide The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT is available now with an MSRP of $649. It's available at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, direct from AMD , and other retailers, though like Nvidia's latest cards, expect stock to be scarce for the time being."

        "Content": "We're at the point in the Game Boy Advance's lifespan where publishers can offer up a huge assortment of bargain-priced handheld games for the system. And bargain prices on the GBA usually mean bargain development budgets, too, and that, in turn, more often than not converts into bland, substandard gaming experiences. Blades of Thunder definitely falls into this category. Oh, this action title starts out rather promising, what with an ambitious, pseudo-3D engine to drive the action. But the whole package is only half-baked, as if most of the resources went into the technical side during development. The actual game design lacks any real substance and comes of amazingly bland and repetitive, and any interest left over after the first level won't last long because there's absolutely no variety from mission to mission.  Blades of Thunder shouldn't be confused with any videogame or movie that uses \"Thunder\" and \"Blade\" in their title as a metaphor for a helicopter. This is an original design for the GBA developed by Interactive Vision . Originally called Battle Hawks when it was in development last year, the game received a title change when Summitsoft picked the game up for publishing. Blades of Thunder may look like a sim-based game on the package, but this presentation's deceiving, as what you're getting is nothing more than a basic forward-scrolling arcade shooter in a 3D perspective. Think old-school, like Raiden or Axelay , but then dumb down the enemies and bring down the action to an unbearable crawl. That's Blades of Thunder . Initially, Blades of Thunder is impressive because it's one of the first games to employ Voxel technology on the Game Boy Advance. This technique, assigning height value to pixels on a flat bitmap, is nothing new in the PC world, but it's a lost art due to its outdated visual ability in an era when texture-mapped polygons can do the job much better. But the GBA's horsepower and screen resolution, or lack thereof, is prime for the Voxel exploitation, but even on the handheld, the technical limitations prevent developers to really push the technique to its fullest. Blades of Thunder gets around the framerate issue and offers somewhat smooth animation because it doesn't move the camera freely; the action is on a forced scrolling field that never rotates. Each level in Blades of Thunder is presented in \"mission\" form, where players have to wipe out primary and secondary targets in order to move on to the next round. There's not much to it; it's just a matter of weaving left and right, blasting enemies as they approach. On occasion, there will be escort portions where you'll follow a caravan to base and you'll have to protect the vehicles as they ride the rail, but other than that, this is shooting action at its most basic. The biggest problem of Blades of Thunder is its level design, or rather, the lack of it. These missions go on far too long, since they're dragged out for miles and miles and miles with no indication on when things are going to end. And what's more, it's almost a challenge to die; you really have to suck to lose a life in Blades of Thunder, since it's too easy to weave out of the way of enemy fire, and their  power against your craft's hull is so minimal it's like being hit with a peashooter. It really feels like most of the development time was put into the graphic engine and almost nothing into the level progression and game design.",

        "Content": "Microsoft\u2019s positioned the $500 Xbox One X as the most powerful console ever made. That\u2019s a claim that's easily backed up by stunning visual and performance upgrades for both its first-party games and select enhanced multi-platform games. That gives the One X a noticeable advantage over its closest competitor, the $400 PS4 Pro. The catch of this slender, cool, and dead-quiet console is that its value is dependent on developers updating their games to make the most of it. Like the One S, the One X can be laid horizontally or vertically and has an internal power supply, so there\u2019s no bulky power brick to deal with. Its black matte plastic casing is sleek, but not quite as attractive as the semi-perforated shell and striking white finish Microsoft presented with the One S. And if you\u2019re already enjoying those quality of life changes having owned an One S, you\u2019ll be happy to know the transition from the One S to the One X is literally as simple as pulling your cables from the former and plugging them into their near-identically corresponding inputs on the latter. Like with the One S, there\u2019s no port for the Kinect (RIP) on the One X, so if you want to use one for old time\u2019s sake you\u2019ll need Microsoft\u2019s $40 USB adapter and occupy one of the One X\u2019s three USB 3.0 ports.  What\u2019s under the hood is much more admirable: a 2.3 GHz processor, 6-teraflop GPU, and 12GB high-speed GDDR5 memory all give it a significant advantage over the PS4 Pro. (Microsoft claims it\u2019s 40% more powerful). And at just 11.8 inches long, 9.4 inches wide, and 2.4 inches high, the One X packs it all into an efficiently compact space that\u2019s around 15% smaller than the PS4 Pro, and yet about 15% heavier at 8.4 pounds.  It\u2019s also as remarkably quiet as the One S, even when it\u2019s working hard, and never got warm enough that overheating in a confined space would be a concern. In fact, the Xbox One X runs only a few degrees warmer than the One S during 4K-enhanced gameplay: both the One S and One X averaged within 106 and 112 degrees fahrenheit, while the PS4 Pro stabilized around 124 degrees during our testing.   But how much better do all those impressive-sounding numbers make your games? It\u2019s a complicated question, and unfortunately there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. While any Xbox One game you load up will take advantage of the One X\u2019s power to run better than it does on the One S, and Microsoft has a list of over 100 existing and upcoming games that are or will be enhanced, the level of that enhancement depends on how much support each respective developer has put in. So, mileage will vary. The good news is that Microsoft\u2019s most popular first-party games have received the royal treatment.  The First Family Gears of War 4 is a prime example. It supports native 4K resolution and high-definition textures to match, HDR10 for improved color depth and contrast on supported televisions, plus \u201cenhanced graphical features\u201d which are most evident in lighting and particles. Maybe most importantly of all, the frame rate in the Campaign and Horde modes is boosted so you can get up to (but not locked) 60 frames per second if you select the performance option in the menu. When all of that is working together, Gears of War 4 on the One X is dramatically smoother, and a sharper, deeper visual experience than it is on the One S. And even without HDR or if you\u2019re hooked up to a 1080p display, it\u2019s an obvious upgrade thanks to those improved effects and supersampling, which shrinks a 4K image down to 1080 in order to smooth out visible jagged edges. Xbox One X Photo Gallery 21 Images Forza Motorsport 7 is a stunning showcase of the One X in native 4K at a steady 60 frames per second with HDR. It\u2019s a beautiful experience. Likewise, Killer Instinct looks and runs great at 4K and 60 frames per second, though its stylized art doesn\u2019t benefit as much from the higher-resolution treatment as Gears of War 4 does. In this same vein, older Xbox One games and even an assortment of backward-compatible 360 games show improvement relative to older consoles (though obviously the One X can\u2019t work miracles like improving an old game\u2019s texture resolution on its own). It\u2019s great to see your old favorites in a new light - games like Halo 3, Fallout 3, and Oblivion all run nicely - but naturally they won\u2019t blow your hair back with the same gusty force of Gears of War 4. Outside of Microsoft's own games, results can be inconsistent. Testing enhanced versions of Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins and Middle-earth: Shadow of War in both their high-resolution and performance modes reveal noticeable improvements even over the PS4 Pro, with cleaner textures, improved shadows, a modest reduction in load times and better performance, depending on the setting. However, games like World of Tanks, Disneyland Adventures, and Super Lucky\u2019s Tale mostly get things like minor visual enhancements and frame rate improvements over the One S. What\u2019s worrisome is that we know from the example of the past year\u2019s worth of PS4 Pro support that the quality of any improvements to \u201cenhanced\u201d games is left completely up to the developers. Will a game run in 4K? Will it have HD textures? Will it have any other improvements to take advantage of the One X\u2019s graphical superpowers? It\u2019s hard to know, unless the changes are specifically spelled out in the store (as is the case with Square Enix and Rise of the Tomb Raider). It\u2019s clear after testing that the One X is the best console for cross-platform games, but the inconsistency of third-party enhancement makes it almost as much of a guessing game as the PS4 Pro. Size Matters Yet when a game does take full advantage of everything the One X can do, there\u2019s a downside: 4K textures are huge. The enhanced versions of both Gears of War 4 and Forza Motorsport 7 weigh in at around a chubby 103 and 95 gigabytes each, respectively, which is roughly double their install size on the One S. And the enhanced Quantum Break nearly breaks the scales at 178 gigabytes thanks to huge amounts of 4K video. The One X has a one-terabyte internal hard drive (with no larger option), but at this rate that\u2019s going to be consumed just as quickly as the original Xbox One\u2019s 500GB. Storage space can be easily expanded with any USB hard drive, but if you don\u2019t already own one that\u2019s an extra expense you have to account for on top of this already premium-priced console. These monster-sized files can also have an impact on install and load times because so much data needs to be transferred to and from the 5400rpm hard drive. For example, loading the first campaign level of the native 4K-enhanced version of Gears of War 4 took the One X roughly 20 seconds, compared to 10 seconds for the standard version on a One S. However, Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins and Shadow of War both regularly loaded faster on the One X than on the PS4 Pro, while loading times on other unenhanced games appeared inconsistent. At The Movies Like the One S before it, the One X is now the most appealing console for home theater enthusiasts thanks to its ultra-HD Blu-ray drive and Dolby Atmos audio support. That ability to play 4K movies off of physical media is something the competing PS4 Pro strangely doesn\u2019t offer. Beyond that, the One X includes a number of cool upgrades like 4K support for DVR game clips (which are downsized to 1080p if you\u2019re uploading directly, but can be exported to a hard drive at 4K if you want to edit and upload from a PC.) Its design also allows easy transfer of data between your Xbox consoles through an external hard drive or your home network. And, with such a focus on visuals, the handy TV calibration and compatibility features help you to ensure your display is hitting the right notes for HDR enhanced games. The long-standing issues with the sluggish dashboard are rectified with the newly updated UI, which runs snappier on the One X."

They dazzled me with their open world design, which felt like the answer to years of fan requests \u2013 but the performance and aesthetic hits that came with that innovation were painful catches that didn\u2019t quite feel worth the trade. Still, with two DLCs on the horizon, I had hope that Game Freak would be able to pull it together. Could the first DLC, The Teal Mask, fix Scarlet and Violet\u2019s glaring issues and deliver a robust, new experience that fully embraced the clear potential of what these games could have been? Nope!!! For starters, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible, but somehow The Teal Mask runs worse than the base game of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet does. I complained about the poor performance of Scarlet and Violet in my initial review, and had hoped that a whole year later Game Freak would have made improvements to things like framerate, pop-in, weird lighting issues, model clipping, and everything else \u2013 problems Nintendo even stated it was working to address back in December. But it hasn\u2019t. Instead, it feels like the DLC has the jankiness turned up about one or two more notches. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It\u2019s still playable: I didn\u2019t run into any game breaking bugs. I did suffer from one hard crash, which while not a huge deal due to the game's frequent autosave, is still pretty shocking given the franchise's relatively polished history. But more importantly, during my playthrough of The Teal Mask it was impossible to go for more than a minute or two without a visual distraction. Maybe my Tinkaton was clipping through the ground during battle, or falling into the abyss when an encounter started on a cliffside. Maybe I was watching nearby Pokemon models vibrate violently, or seeing NPCs vanish in and out of existence. Or maybe the whole thing was just chugging, simply because I was riding on my Miraidon and it didn\u2019t know how to handle more than a few trees appearing on screen at once. Look, I don\u2019t expect high-fidelity graphics at the level of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in my Pokemon games. But the sheer amount of issues is so distracting all the time that it became an active detriment to my enjoyment. And if Game Freak keeps up its current pace of making performance several degrees worse with each game, by the next gen or so Pokemon might be literally unplayable, because you won\u2019t be able to see anything. Fingers crossed that The Indigo Disk DLC this Winter improves matters literally at all. What We Said About Pokemon Scarlet and Violet I\u2019ve been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun\u2026 it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined \u2013 a belief I also held about Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts \u2013 visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness \u2013 are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pok\u00e9mon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pok\u00e9mon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pok\u00e9mon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you\u2019re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we\u2019ve all come to expect has not been shown here. \u2013 Rebekah Valentine, November 23, 2022 Score: 6 Read the full Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review. I don\u2019t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid battles from the original review still haven\u2019t been fixed, which tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet refreshes its available raids and doesn\u2019t notify you when they\u2019re full. And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn, freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what\u2019s going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without running into this stuff and being frustrated by it. Kitakami feels like a massive letdown. \u201c My feelings about the new Kitakami island region itself aren\u2019t much fonder. Like Paldea, the world of Scarlet and Violet\u2019s DLC is butt-ugly, with low-res textures, little detail in its environments, and a single town mostly made up of buildings you can\u2019t enter and NPCs uttering boring, nothing phrases. That big local \u201cfestival\u201d that the trailers hyped up? It\u2019s just a few carts with vendors and some uninteresting NPCs. It\u2019s even more of a disappointment when you consider that Kitakami is based on Japan \u2013 a nation that Game Freak has based multiple memorable regions off of before (Kanto and Johto). When I\u2019ve already seen a Japanese-inspired world done in such loving detail in multiple Pokemon Games, Kitakami feels like a massive letdown.

Dipplin Poltchageist/Sinistcha Ogerpon Bloodmoon Ursaluna Okidogi Munkidori Fezandipiti Answer See Results That said, The Teal Mask isn\u2019t all bad. The battling and competitive aspects are still what they\u2019ve always been (good), and it\u2019s still fun to fill up a PC box full of neat little dudes you find running around outside. The island checks all the boxes for that activity specifically: it\u2019s big, full of Pokemon, and has lots of different biomes to poke around in. One of my favorite parts of Kitakami was the mountain at its center with crystalline pools at the summit, numerous caves along its path to the top, and a surprising cavern structure within full of Pokemon hiding around corners and in little holes. But the overall ugliness and performance issues did detract from locations that looked like they were probably quite beautiful in their concept art, just not their final execution \u2013 such as when I first laid eyes on those sparkling pools on the mountaintop, or when I crossed a thin, stone bridge to a mysterious cave as the sunset hit the surrounding rock formations. The plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming. \u201c Content-wise, The Teal Mask largely consists of a familiar Pokemon formula where you track down a legendary Pokemon while learning about local lore. You\u2019re accompanied on this quest by a sibling pair, Carmine and Kieran, both of whom spent most of the story alternating between yelling at me over nothing and challenging me to battles. The Teal Mask\u2019s plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming, which is a pretty big bummer after the heights reached during the ending of Scarlet and Violet. This DLC campaign is also short, about seven or eight hours long, though catching every newly-added monster will stretch it a bit more.

After hours of Carmine and Kieran shouting at me, Perrin\u2019s curiosity and backstory with photography were a refreshing change, and her photo-taking minigame provided a natural avenue for The Teal Mask to expand on something I loved in Scarlet and Violet: discovering Pokemon doing fun Pokemon things in their habitats. Frankly, Perrin\u2019s story is so much more interesting than the rest of the DLC that it\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t spend more time hanging out with her and her Hisuian Growlithe instead of being dragged around by the world\u2019s most unnecessarily angsty preteens. Ogre Oustin\u2019 is boring, repetitive, and runs terribly (especially online). \u201c Other new features in The Teal Mask include an expanded Pokedex with a tiny handful of new monsters, a middling selection of new cosmetic choices, and a terrible minigame called \u201cOgre Oustin\u2019\u201d that involves tanking your framerate further by speeding around on your bike to collect berries really fast. While I\u2019m always happy to praise Game Freak\u2019s Pokemon designs (especially the candy apple-themed Dipplin \u2013 cute!), and it\u2019s nice to finally change out of my hideous school uniform, I don\u2019t know what they were thinking with Ogre Oustin\u2019. It\u2019s boring, repetitive, runs terribly (especially online), and yet made me feel bad about not wanting to play it by offering great rewards for anyone looking to build raiding or competitive teams. Terrible. Every IGN Pokemon Review Ever 56 Images The ways in which The Teal Mask feels like a step backward from what made Scarlet and Violet astonishing are also disappointing. Scarlet and Violet themselves promoted player freedom: you could go anywhere you wanted at almost any time, and do the major plot points in any order. The Teal Mask mysteriously tosses that in the bin in favor of a far more standard, linear journey. While you can explore any part of the island at any time, there\u2019s no benefit to doing so beyond catching Pokemon. You can\u2019t even do the initial quest \u2013 which involves visiting three sign boards around the island \u2013 in any order. The sudden loss of that player freedom is painful given how critical it was to my enjoyment of the base game. It\u2019s also a surprisingly weak effort when compared to Game Freak\u2019s previous DLC attempts in Pokemon Sword and Shield\u2019s Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra. While both of these DLC were similarly criticized for being shallow in the story department, Isle of Armor added challenge by forcing you to train a brand new Pokemon, while Crown Tundra included multiple new game modes. The Teal Mask does\u2026 none of that, and feels distinctly incomplete. Maybe that\u2019s because it was always meant to be just one half of a package with The Indigo Mask, but if that\u2019s the case, then I question the wisdom of splitting the DLC at all."

Using a unique art style and humor, the game was intended to put the spotlight on the ridiculous amount of fear in the United States regarding just about everything disaster, disease, or terrorist related. The premise was strong. The actual result is a disaster scarier than most of those found in the game.  There's a laundry list of problems with Bad Day L.A. that wanders as aimlessly as the game from the lost potential of the art style to the inane gameplay and back humorless potty humor. It's hard to find anything that went particularly well with Bad Day L.A. despite the promise of something new, different, and fun.   Bad Day L.A. is set in Los Angeles and follows the story of a man named Anthony Williams who was at one time a successful agent and now homeless by choice. Much to his chagrin he becomes a reluctant hero as disaster after disaster strikes the California sprawl. Zombies, terrorists, monstrous tidal waves, earthquakes, and meteor showers wreak havoc on the hopeless inhabitants.  The pre-rendered cutscenes that show these calamities in action are the best and shortest part of the game. They demonstrate how lovely the art style could have been if given the needed technical attention. As it stands, the cutscenes only manage to show how sadly inadequate the in-game visuals really are. Style is slaughtered by poor execution. Chunky levels, awkward animations, low quality textures, and no noticeable flash or special effects create pathetically boring environments and action. It's obvious from the visuals that this game was created for a wide audience, not because of style, but because of the low technical requirements. There aren't even any graphic options aside from brightness, contrast, gamma, and whether shadows are on or off. No resolution options in or out of the game could be found.  The aim was mass-market success due to personality, humor, and some easily digestible gameplay. Unfortunately the humor is sadly juvenile up to the point of being tasteless and offensive. Keep in mind this comment comes from someone that considers fart jokes high humor. F-bombs and other four letter wonders abound but are used without timing or purpose. IGN isn't exactly a PG environment but curse words, when used for humor, should be more about situation and emphasis, not overwhelming force of numbers. Cussing does not equal funny. Crapping in the street does not necessarily equal funny. Neither does extreme violence. I'm not exactly a king of comedy but it's hard to imagine that I couldn't have done a better job writing less excruciating humor.   As we watched the two main thrusts of interest for Bad Day L.A., art and humor, thrash around in the gutter, we noticed gameplay was all too happy to stand lazily aside and watch them die. Level design is uninspired (which is confounding considering the subject matter), linear, predictable, repetitive, and aggravating. You'd think with the subject matter of disaster after disaster hitting Los Angeles they could have come up with some more interesting scenarios than constantly dousing the thousands of citizens idiotic enough to light themselves on fire, battle with gang members, and fight through belligerent airport security. The few glimpses of creativity are bound and gagged by poor follow through after initial concept.  Nothing demonstrates that quite as well as the four characters that tag along through the adventure. There's the sick kid that throws up, Mexican guy with a chainsaw and amnesia, blonde bimbo lady with the accessory dog, and one-armed colonel what's his name. They're there for personality but provide none, serve basically no purpose in gameplay except to suffer near constant death (which thankfully doesn't effect anything) and bum around while you do the fighting. There's no strategy or puzzle solving involved, which would have made more sense.  The action gameplay is equally as bad. Weapons are unsatisfying, enemies spawn randomly (half the time right behind you), snipers and gunners lock on and shoot from unseen locations, and there's basically no tactics or strategy even in boss battles. Getting new players into the industry means giving more interesting things to do, not less. Where are the mini-games, funny environments, and crazy gameplay scenarios?"

        "Content": "Hyrule Warriors Legends for 3DS and New 3DS is the portable version of Hyrule Warriors for the Wii U. Here\u2019s what we said about that game in 2014:  \u201cSurprisingly, Hyrule Warriors does a good job of tying together the combat of Dynasty Warriors and the revered characters and lore of the Legend of Zelda series in a way that makes me feel powerful in a world I love. Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. It\u2019s just a shame you can\u2019t share the action with a friend without significant slowdown.\u201d  Read the original Hyrule Warriors review here . Most of this still holds true for Hyrule Warriors Legends, but the shoddy performance of this port makes it a lot less desireable, especially if you don\u2019t have a New 3DS. If you own a 3DS or a 2DS, read our Hyrule Warriors Legends review here.   Simply put, this isn\u2019t a good-looking New 3DS game. The action runs smoothly on the stronger New 3DS hardware, which is nice, but it has lots of dull, muddy textures, very few effects, and noticeable pop-in. Turning on 3D degrades performance considerably - character animations become incredibly choppy as the system struggles to to keep up. Its impact was noticeable enough that I never wanted to try it again.  Simply put, this isn\u2019t a good-looking New 3DS game. \u201c  Technical failings like these suck the wind out of a game that, otherwise, is brimming with fanservice for Zelda fans. Take the epic scale of the first boss fight with Dodongo. Rather than charge through the wall with an effective explosion, the barricade simply vanishes on contact, resulting in a cheap-looking setup for a big moment that feels incomplete. It\u2019s a brief but jarring example of how slipshod this port can feel at times, and even ignoring that, Dodongo and the rest of the bosses look equally lame thanks to hideously low-resolution textures. Rather than make use of the 3DS\u2019s graphics capability to make textures that look good at lower resolution, this port simply scales down the Wii U textures until they\u2019re a blurry mess. Even a lot of the menus look bad because of horribly smudged or blurry art.   The sad thing is that these issues spoil a few smart changes that make this mindless action game a much better experience on a handheld. A quick-swap feature lets you instantly switch characters mid-battle, and you can even direct fellow soldiers like Zelda and Impa on the map using the touch screen. This change has a major impact on how you control the flow of battle: it goes from a frantic dash from place to place to a much more strategic flow. You can now spread out your units and switch your attention to skirmishes that need immediate action when appropriate. Legends also introduces Owl Statues that can be activated with a handy Ocarina item, which helps you teleport quickly around the map. I felt more well-equipped to handle waves of foes that had given me trouble in the Wii U version.  New characters Toon Link, Tetra, and King Daphnes each introduce fresh and distinct movesets... \u201c Also on the bright side, it was the many layers of Zelda fanservice that managed to keep my attention for Hyrule Warrior\u2019s 10-hour campaign the first time around, and Legends adds to that with five new characters on top of the already-packed roster, for a total of 24 warriors, including the ones previously released as DLC. New characters Toon Link, Tetra, and King Daphnes each introduce fresh and distinct movesets while bringing the criminally under-represented cast of  Wind Waker into the fold.  Skull Kid\u2019s playful fighting style and Ocarina sound effects make lots of nods to his debut in Majora\u2019s Mask, while Linkle (a female version of Link) wields a pair of crossbows and juggles opponents with acrobatic flair. As a bonus, if you own the Wii U version, buying the 3DS version gets you a code to unlock all of these five new characters there, too.",

We\u2019ve already looked at the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT , and now it\u2019s time to take a close look at its younger sibling, the Radon RX 6800. Coming to market at $579, it\u2019s competing directly with the Nvidia RTX 3070 . Does it have what it takes to earn a place on your holiday wishlist? AMD Radeon RX 6800 Review 8 Images  AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Design and Features Like the RX 6800 XT, the Radeon RX 6800 has undergone a radical redesign this generation. The loud blower-style coolers of yesteryear have been left in the dust of the much more stylish and effective triple-fan cooler found here. Visually, the design is extremely similar to the RX 6800 XT, and there\u2019s a real sense of style that stands apart from even many third-party cards. The mix of silver, black, and mirror finishes really makes the card stand out while also avoiding the garrishness of overdone RGB. I said the XT-version reminded me of a cross between a muscle car and spaceship and I stand by that here. Where the RTX 3000-series looks minimalist and utilitarian, the RX 6000 series goes for flash. Which AMD Graphics Card are you getting? AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT AMD Radeon RX 6800 An older AMD GPU Team Green FTW! Answer See Results The biggest difference between the two cards is their thickness. As the lower powered of the two cards, the thermal load is naturally going to be less, so AMD was able to equip it with a standard two-slot heat sink. This is good news if your gaming PC also has internal sound or capture card because it will allow for more room to draw cool air through its fin stack.  Otherwise the two cards are nearly identical on the outside. The RX 6800 is still powered by dual eight-pin PSU connectors (no proprietary headers here!), as well as the same array of video outputs: 2x DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, each offering Display Stream Compression for those 4K HDR gaming monitors, one HDMI 2.1 output, and a USB Type-C output for easily connecting a virtual reality headset . Who said USB-C out on graphics cards was dead? It\u2019s only once you look under the hood that the differences begin to stand out. Like the RX 6800 XT, this card is built on AMD\u2019s 7nm process and features the same 26.8 billion transistor count, but it features a trimmed back processor and clock speed. In total, it packs 3840 stream processors and 60 compute units, each with its own Ray Tracing Accelerator for hardware-based ray tracing. This is roughly 17% less each, while also being 50% more than last generation\u2019s AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT . Given the relative performance of each card, that actually lines up quite well. When it comes to clock speeds, the RX 6800 features a \u201cGame Clock\u201d of 1815MHz and a Boost Clock of 2105MHz. Again, this is a more modest promise than the 2015 MHz and 2205MHz of the RX 6800 XT, but a noteworthy improvement over the RX 5700 XT\u2019s 1755MHz and 1905MHz. As has been the case for years, these figures should be taken with a grain of salt as each card will intelligently ramp itself up beyond these limits so long as it stays within acceptable power and thermal limits. For example, when gaming, my sample would routinely clock itself up to 2275 MHz and hover there. It\u2019s not quite the 150MHz boost I found on the RX 6800 XT, but the top speed remains impressive compared to Nvidia\u2019s current RTX 3000 line-up, which often hover between 1900 - 2000MHz.  Another highlight the RX 6800 shares with the RX 6800 XT is its large store of video memory. Each card features 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 256-bit bus. With a bandwidth of 512 GB/s, it\u2019s a far cry from the ridiculous 760 GB/s speeds offered by the Nvidia RTX 3080 \u2019s GDDR6X, but is perfectly sufficient for 4K gaming. Since this card is squarely targeting 1440p, standard GDDR6 is a good choice, as is the generous capacity featured on both cards. Compared to the 10GB on the RTX 3080 and 8GB on the RTX 3070, 16 gigabytes feels downright exorbitant and offers the kind of headroom that will give both RX 6000-series cards ample headroom for the advanced textures and graphical effects always around the next bend in PC gaming. Of course, the Radeon RX 6800 also brings with it all of the improvements of AMD\u2019s new RDNA 2 architecture. I give a thorough breakdown of the improvements in my review of the RX 6800 XT, so you can read the full breakdown there, but there are a few important high points that allow this card to be more than meets the eye. First, instead of using a dedicated core just for ray tracing, each compute unit has its own ray tracing accelerator. Every clock cycle, each CU is able to process four ray intersections. This allows the system to be scalable while also offering a massive improvement over software level ray tracing. Additionally, you should be aware that RDNA leverages Microsoft\u2019s DirectX ray tracing solution, DXR, and not RTX. That\u2019s important, because certain games that are designed explicitly for RTX will not work on the RX 6800 or 6800 XT. Second, each announced RX 6000-series card features a brand new store of GPU-level memory called Infinity Cache. This cache allows the GPU to store important data rather than pull on the VRAM, which reduces latency and increases effective bandwidth. This memory store is also a key reason for the impressive clock speeds the GPU is able to deliver, and aids in the increased performance per watt. This card, despite being far more advanced than the RX 5700 XT, has a TDP of only 250 watts, 25 watts higher than the 5700 XT.  Third, the RX 6000-series is synergistic with the Ryzen 5000 CPU platform through a new system called Smart Access Memory. If you\u2019re running one of AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen CPUs on a 500-series motherboard, your CPU will be able to access all 16GB of the RX 6800\u2019s VRAM for a boost in performance. AMD claims this averages to about 6% but can be more depending on the game in question (their documents show Forza Horizon 4 receiving a 15% improvement at 1440p, for example). Since our test bench is built on the Intel platform, I wasn\u2019t able to test this for myself, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect a modest performance bump by the function of this new system. There is lots more to RDNA 2, including game- and performance-enhancing features like Radeon Boost and Radeon Anti-Lag, as well as boons to content creators like HEVC encoding/decoding and AV1 decoding, so be sure to head over to the RX 6800 XT review and take a look.   AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Performance  Test system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply. With all of that preliminary information out of the way, it\u2019s time to take a look at how the card actually performs. All of our cards are put through a series of synthetic tests and real world gaming benchmarks. Since AMD seemed to be taking aim at the RTX 3070, I\u2019ll be focusing mainly on 4K and 1440p gameplay, but also note 1080p results in our initial game tests. As I mentioned above, our system is unable to take advantage of Smart Access Memory, so if you\u2019re running a system composed of a Ryzen 5000 processor, AMD 500 motherboard, and RX 6000 GPU, you can expect a roughly 6% increase in performance.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Synthetic Benchmarks   Looking at synthetic benchmarks, the RX 6800 performs very well. It outperforms the RTX 3070 handily and comes in just below the RTX 3080.   Turning to ray tracing, I ran each card through Surgical Scalpels\u2019 Boundary Benchmark as well as 3DMark\u2019s Port Royal and Ray Tracing Tests. Here, the RX 6800 performs significantly below the RTX line-up and RX 6800 XT. This is to be expected because of its position on the product stack and, in the Boundary benchmark in particular, demonstrates the importance of a scaling solution like DLSS. Without that, the RX 6800 offered only 36% of the performance of the RTX 3070. In 3DMark\u2019s ray tracing test, where neither card was able to benefit from DLSS, the results were closer, but the RTX 3070 still led the RX 6800 by 48%. AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Gaming Benchmarks 5 Images When it comes to normal rasterization, the RX 6800 does very well, going head to head and even beating the RTX 3070 in several cases. At 1440p, it\u2019s able to maintain 60 FPS in three of the five games above, with the exceptions being Metro Exodus , which was 55 FPS with also had RTX on high, and Red Dead Redemption 2 which was 58 FPS. Compared to the RX 5700 XT, the gains are very large, with an average improvement of 52% at 4K, 58% at 1440p, and 49% at 1080p.  Since the card is positioned so directly against the RTX 3070, which was itself compared directly to the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti , I opted to do some expanded testing, beginning with 4K. As you can see, in non-ray traced games, the card does a good job of keeping pace with the RTX 3070. In fact, removing Wolfenstein: Youngblood from all calculations (ray tracing is exclusive to Nvidia, so AMD\u2019s figures are not comparable), it averages 10% faster than the RTX 3070 and only 15% slower than the RX 6800 XT. Once ray tracing is factored in and Nvidia\u2019s cards are able to take advantage of DLSS, that lead evaporates. The average performance across all games (except Wolfenstein) puts it 12% slower than the RTX 3070. Is it fair to compare ray tracing performance between AMD and Nvidia when RTX cards have DLSS and AMD cards do not? I would argue that it is as that is exactly what many gamers will do when considering between the two. AMD seems to know as much, because it\u2019s developing its own answer to Nvidia\u2019s AI upscaling system: FidelityFX Super Resolution, but little is known about this technology other than that it is in development. When it will arrive and how it will work is anyone\u2019s guess. The reality of Nvidia\u2019s lead is hard to ignore here because most games supporting ray tracing also support DLSS. Even though the RX 6800 offers good performance at 4K and below as we\u2019ll see in a second, the absence of such a system is a significant drawback at launch. Comparisons and resolution scaling aside, I was impressed at how well the RX 6800 was able to handle non-ray traced games at 4K resolution. In my testing, leaving ray tracing turned off increases FPS by 40-50%, allowing many games to perform near or even above 60 FPS.   Looking at 1440p, which I would argue is the target resolution for this card, we see a similar story in comparative performance, but here it\u2019s even more valuable to look at the actual FPS in each game. Even with ray tracing turned on, most games I tested performed well above 60 FPS. Of those that fell below, two were very close (Metro Exodus averaged 55 FPS, Battlefield V was 57) and only two were unplayably low: Control and Minecraft RTX . It\u2019s also worth calling out just how well Dirt 5 performed even without DLSS. Dirt 5 appears to be optimized for AMD, and the RX 6800 cleans the RTX 3070\u2019s clock as a result. Given that current-gen consoles are also being built on the RDNA 2 architecture and will utilize ray tracing, I\u2019m optimistic at what this means for the future of ray tracing on AMD cards. Of course, if you\u2019re not interested in ray tracing, these results are also very good news. If you\u2019re gaming at 1440p with DXR disabled, the RX 6800 is able to run many games at or above 100 FPS.  AMD Radeon RX 6800 \u2013 Thermals and Acoustics The new triple fan design is an improvement versus the blower style cooler of the previous generation. In my testing, the RX 6800 reached a peak temperature of 80C. This is definitely warmer than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3000-series GPUs, but since AMD determines throttling based on a junction temperature (hottest spot on the die) of 110C, it didn\u2019t actually result in any throttling that I observed. The card is also noticeably louder than Nvidia\u2019s most recent cards, rising above my PC fans for a clear rise and fall as the card would spin up and down. In short, the thermal solution works, but still lags behind the competition in temperatures and acoustic performance.

        "Content": "The Nintendo DS' intuitive stylus controls make it seem like a perfect platform for the revival of the classic adventure genre. Gamers who grew up on these sorts of point-and-click adventure titles \u2013 beloved games like Monkey Island, Full Throttle and Grim Fandango \u2013 would love the chance to take a nostalgia-laced trip through these classics once again in handheld form, but are they willing to accept a few technical and narrative concessions in the process?   Tetraedge Games sure hopes so, as they've just released a port of Microids' critically successful 2002 PC adventure title Syberia on the Nintendo DS. Unfortunately, a lot of changes were made to the game's core gameplay and narrative in the process, ultimately making the DS translation the worst iteration thus far. Point-and-click aficionados will enjoy the game's unique world and intriguing story, but there's no denying that Syberia is clearly meant for the PC.  The game opens with Kate Walker, Syberia's main protagonist and the character players control throughout the adventure, standing in the rain as a procession of mechanical automatons passes through the gates of a small nearby church. She has come to the small European town of Valadilene to secure the sale of a small toy company for her employer. This seemingly simple assignment becomes much more complex when Kate discovers Anna Voralberg, owner of the Voralberg Toy Company, has passed away and the only way to complete the sale is to locate the missing heir.  When it was originally released in 2002, Syberia's narrative was heralded as a complex, weaving tale completely unlike most anything that came before, and it remains so even to this day. The story plays out more like a good novel than your typical videogame narrative, a fact that will delight some and turn off even more. Those with the patience for a slow-paced plot, however, will love the intricacies to be found within the world of Syberia. This is a world steeped in reality, with just enough fantasy to keep players intrigued from beginning to end.  One thing fans of the original PC version will no doubt notice is Tetraedge's decision to remove the subplot between Kate and her husband-to-be back home. I personally found the relational side-story to be a refreshing way to characterize Kate and track her growth throughout the tale. Whether it be to streamline the narrative or due to the technical limitations of the DS cartridge, I found the removal highly disappointing. Kate Walker isn't nearly as outwardly appealing as adventure gaming icons such as Guybrush Threepwood or Manny Calavera, but the numerous phone conversations throughout the original adventure firmly cemented her as a strong and personable lead. Removing these sections of the game ultimately limits her appeal, an unfortunate casualty in this DS port.  In fact, a lot of little plot details are noticeably absent in the handheld version of the game. Newspaper clippings are absent, a few characters have been removed and letters that are clearly meant to be picked up and read simply lay open in front of you without the ability to be interacted with. These changes likely won't be too detrimental for newcomers but will no doubt sour the experience slightly for those hoping to immerse themselves in the world of Syberia for a second or third time.  Syberia's gameplay has likewise been simplified in the jump from the computer monitor to touch screen. Players will find that a few puzzles have been streamlined \u2013 simplifying solutions or removing them altogether \u2013 to better accommodate the relatively low-resolutions of the DS. For instance, one puzzle within the game tasks Kate with lifting the floodgate of a small dam in order to cross a shallow creek. In the PC version, the lever used to open the floodgate is broken and Kate must find an item suitable to replace it before asking a young boy for help in pushing it. In the DS version, the lever is already in place, so all Kate has to do is ask the nearby boy for support. At that point it's hardly even a puzzle at all, merely just an annoying extra step dramatically retarding player progression. Annoying as that may be, it's definitely an isolated example. Most puzzles, fortunately, survive the transition from PC to DS intact.  In addition to the puzzle adaptations, Tetraedge even threw a few touch screen environment interactions into the mix for good measure. The problem is that these new touch-sensitive interactions rarely work as easily or as accurately as they should. I had to repeat the same stylus motion over ten times before the game finally recognized what I was trying to do, and that was just for pulling a lever straight down. Don't even get me started on the motions necessary to wind up one of the game's many mechanical automatons.  As far as controls go, Syberia on the DS is controlled exclusively with the stylus. In theory, this means that the game should work similarly to the PC version. Unfortunately, that's simply not the case. The DS' relatively low-resolution screens make selecting specific items nearly impossible, especially when they're close to other items, as individual pixel selection is virtually impossible to achieve. This problem is exacerbated by the game's eccentric camera angles and sometimes difficult-to-read screen edges. Players will often click on an object only to just barely miss it, sending Kate walking into the next panel unnecessarily.  The game's \"look\" function seeks to alleviate this particular problem by allowing players to drag the eyeball icon over the screen at any time to reveal which items can be used, spoken to or otherwise interacted with. Again, it's a good idea in theory but doesn't work in practice. The large stylus and the gamer's natural hand position often block the interaction indicators, and even when it doesn't there are sections where the \"look\" icon doesn't reveal an object can be interacted with when, in fact, it most assuredly can.  When the game was released on the PC in 2002, Syberia was praised for it's gorgeous visuals. Filled with amazingly designed pre-rendered backgrounds and detailed character models, the PC version was definitely a step forward for adventure games of the time. The DS version doesn't live up to the same high standard, unfortunately, reducing the resolution of the backgrounds and turning the characters into blocky, awkward approximations of their former selves. What's more, Kate's walking animation never quite matches the angle of the backgrounds, making her slow strolls from one screen to the next nearly unbearable to watch. Considering that Syberia is full of backgrounds meant only to show off the original's sharp visual fidelity, the poor resolution and even poorer animations definitely become an issue as the game continues."

Wrap all of this ridiculousness in some contentedly outdated graphics and a framerate that becomes unstable whenever your explosive shenanigans reach a fever pitch, and you\u2019re in for an uproarious good time. It\u2019s hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in seconds. \u201c You\u2019ll also bounce between four returning character classes: the Ranger, a standard soldier whose only advantage is that their weapons are the best around; the Wing Diver, a Valkyrie-like class whose jet-pack and wings give her unmatched mobility (offset by the fact that she\u2019s killed by a light breeze); the Air Raider, an often second-fiddle support class who specializes in calling in massive bombing runs, relies on gadgets like drones to squish bugs, and can summon vehicles to deal serious damage; and the Fencer, a dual-wielding tank class who can absorb serious damage with a giant shield and smash things to bits in melee, but who is also quite difficult to play well. It might be a little milquetoast, but I favor the Ranger \u2013 it\u2019s just hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in a few seconds and assault rifles that plow through hundreds of aliens with ease. What's your Earth Defense Force 6 class of choice? Ranger Wing Diver Air Raider Fencer Answer See Results While the stories in Earth Defense Force games have always been charming rubbish, EDF 6 sets a new bar with a tale that actively makes no sense at various points (even if, like me, you\u2019re following along very closely and occasionally taking notes). It makes heavy use of time travel and has humanity losing the war against the Primus, only for you and the aliens to both go back in time to try again \u2013 but the good guys perplexingly make very little use of the knowledge gained in the previous timeline, so you\u2019ll have to watch them slowly piece together what\u2019s happening while you and your character are already miles ahead of the buffoons trying saving humanity. Most of the time, this insanity is as amusing as you might hope, like when one part introduces giant frog enemies and says they\u2019re \u201cjust like humans\u201d without addressing the fact that they\u2019re clearly frogs, then later introduces cliche humanoid gray martian enemies and describes them as \u201cnot humanoid.\u201d Other times, though, it\u2019s just painful, like one section where they explain the origins and biological breakdown of a flying dragon monster while making you fight it about five times in a row, reminiscent of a filler episode of Dragonball Z. The story's insanity is as amusing as you might hope most of the time. \u201c The extremely poorly written story is eclipsed in its dreadfulness only by the voice acting, which sounds like it was performed by some poor souls who were rejected by their local improv troupes and decided to give video game voices a try. One part nearly made me spit-take when a character says, in the most monotone voice imaginable, \u201cyou have no idea how relieved I am\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re right, my dude, I definitely do not. But between all of that cringey dialogue and senseless plot development, there\u2019s a ton of joy. There is still plenty of the kind of bad-by-design silliness at which EDF excels, and the times where it manages to walk that line properly are a gift that keeps on giving. Thankfully, the heart and soul of Earth Defense Force 6, its over-the-top combat against all manner of blurry foes, is actually a lot of fun \u2013 and oftentimes pretty darn challenging. Dodging, dashing, and flying out of the way as monsters, aliens, overgrown insects, and robots rock the screen (and threaten the framerate) is exactly the kind of action-packed madness I love about this series, and it\u2019s never been done better than in this iteration. The fundamentals of that action may be almost identical to what we got a few games ago, but EDF6 adds a ton of weapons and new enemy types to the mix and then dreams up interesting scenarios to put you in, like one level where you\u2019re defending a beach from an entire army of giant poisonous reptiles. Playing through on the normal difficulty can be challenging enough, especially if you don\u2019t have a competent crew at your back, but it gets absolutely insane once you dial that up to the harder options. It requires an intense amount of grinding to get the requisite powerful weapons and armor to put up a fight, plus a team who absolutely knows what they\u2019re doing. As with prior entries, combat\u2019s simple setup and silly attitude don\u2019t get in the way of being extremely entertaining and genuinely satisfying to overcome, and that can make it pretty hard to put down.

There\u2019s no option to watch what other players are doing if they aren\u2019t standing right by you and no respawn timer, which is just plain boring. There are also a handful of maps you\u2019ll find yourself running missions on quite a few times, and while the enemies and objectives are usually at least a little different, the lack of variety definitely grated on me at times. Also, you\u2019re occasionally made to play some slower-paced, story-focused levels that are simply the worst, though they at least only show up at a few specific moments. This isn\u2019t the kind of story that\u2019s at all worth slowing down the pacing to tell, and those segments just absolutely waste your time in a campaign that\u2019s already way longer than it probably should be."
