        "Content": "I wish I lived in Sandrock. It's a place where a cat can be a celebrated member of the town guard and every street gets fully decked out for the holidays. It's where newcomers are enthusiastically welcomed, contrary to other Western stories where folks \"not from around these parts\" are met with suspicion. It's got plenty of Western staples though; a ranch managed by a salt-of-the-earth family (even if the husband is a little unhinged), a cute main street with a saloon and general store, plenty of lovely Western accents, and of course, a touch of danger. My Time at Sandrock is an excellent entry in an ever-growing list of cozy games, consistently fun while managing to stand apart from the crowd thanks to its theme of optimism grown out of hard times. As a sequel to the post-apocalyptic RPG town sim My Time at Portia, the desert-based follow-up My Time at Sandrock is deeply familiar. Like its predecessor, you've come to this struggling town to assist in improving and growing it by building items and relationships. Learning to build an efficient workshop was a great joy, and I'm proud of how I can take on townie requests and build main story items with relative ease by the end of the 75 hours I\u2019ve spent with it so far. What we said about My Time at Portia My time at Portia is, first and foremost, a game about building, and I've had a great time doing it. From mining to taming wild llamas to dating, there\u2019s a lot to do here, and I\u2019m still discovering and unlocking new and usually interesting things. While each of its parts is lacking in some way or have annoying audio bugs, when you put them all together they bolster each other to add up to something fun. I look forward to seeing how My Time at Portia continues to evolve in the future. - Miranda Sanchez, Jan 29, 2019 Score: 8 Read the full My Time at Portia review . Along the way you\u2019ll have to gather resources, use those resources to build specific items for main story quests, side quests, or optional commissions, and then use the money earned (combined with the increased prestige of your workshop) to invest in better equipment to make even more items. It can be a grind early on, but it's just the calm kind of grind I'm looking for in these games. Progression is steady both in terms of new quests and new things to create, which meant I never lost interest. Resource gathering starts with digging through scrap piles and kicking trees, eventually working up to diving into old world ruins that are generally safe apart from the occasional trap. Mining is once again a relaxing and quiet activity that has an added drop of excitement thanks to a special rat enemy that appears at random when breaking an object. If it's slain, it'll drop gold and other valuable rewards. I appreciate that this wrinkle kept me on my toes without interrupting the flow of mining much. My Time at Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting \u201c Getting wood poses a unique challenge; as a city nestled in a desert plagued with sandstorms, keeping any deep-rooted plants alive is a priority for the townsfolk. With that in mind, cutting down any trees in Sandrock's city limits results in a fine for offenders and damages relationships with townsfolk. It's one of several ways Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting. I may have accidentally forgotten this once, leaving me with a warning from a cheery but concerned member of the church. The stump of the tree I almost destroyed still stands just outside my workshop as a good reminder of my mistake. Sandrock's story has three main plotlines; one is about defending the town and general area from mutant lizards called Geeglers; another is about discovering how to reverse the desertification brought on by a \"relic rush\" that sucked the town dry of resources; and finally, a hunt for a bandit called Logan, a former child of the community who went bad after mysterious events. One of the three storylines is almost always active with maybe only few days of downtime between them, so they kept me busy. I was excited whenever a new thread began as it's hard to guess what storyline is going to kick up next. Do you like combat in your farm life games? Yes, the more the better Some is fine No, I want a peaceful life I don't care either way Answer See Results IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask All three of these threads are enjoyable to pull, though I was most interested in Logan's story as his turn to banditry befuddled many in the town. It got even more enticing as his actions against the town intensified. I love how almost everyone in the town has something new to say after a major story beat as well. As you'd imagine, most story objectives are completed by building new essential items and structures, like a new water tower, or occasionally going out and clearing out baddies from old world ruins. Combat in Sadrock is similar to Portia's in that it's still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system that's best in short encounters, which is what occurs most throughout Sandrock. Aiming down the sights of guns for an alternate third-person perspective is a nice addition, but doesn't drastically improve a given fight. Dungeons in Sandrock are woefully straightforward and tend to err on the side of boring if you attempt to explore them in their entirety. Some enemies have interesting attack patterns and designs, including bosses, but with combat being so simple and my character being rather tanky, you\u2019re only ever in any real danger if you go into an area where you're drastically under-leveled. Combat is still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system. \u201c Sandrock allegedly boasts tons of weapons, but aside from boring throwing rocks, I only saw stronger variants of five melee options and two different guns. Finding a meaningful puzzle element or a new weapon for every forced dungeon crawl could have made them more appealing. There's an attempt to have side rooms with optional treasure chests, but exploring these dungeons to find every chest just doesn't feel worth it. Chests in dungeons and around the world rarely have anything of significant value, ranging from a small handful of money to a new food recipe. The latter is nice, but I'd prefer to get a unique clothing item, a new weapon, or maybe even a complex component that I could put toward a new project instead. In addition to the main story, there's a constant stream of side quests born out of the needs of the Sandrock residents. Some seem to happen based on the time of year, but most come from relationship benchmarks. Sandrock's residents are excellent, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface on a handful of their stories. Where Portia's residents could be dull or too stereotypical, I found Sandrock's residents to be vibrant. Plenty of residents have a mix of accents, including thick western ones that lend an air of authenticity to the Wild West setting. They lean on melodrama and iconic movie and TV references for humor, too, and it usually works well \u2013 yes, I did enjoy the mention of the knockoff Gundam show and reversals of iconic Star Wars quotes. But even so, the character writing is smart, both in being clever and going over my head when it came to some of the local researcher's in-depth science talk. My Time at Sandrock Screenshots 26 Images There's an impressive number people to meet too, with more than 45 friendable characters in Sandrock, and even more new townsfolk moving in as the story progresses. Occasional NPCs come through town for story beats as well and aren't necessarily available for friendship activities like gifting, but they add to the feel of Sandrock as a growing town worthy of people just passing through. Some of my favorite characters included a rancher named Cooper who has a knack for highly detailed rants that usually wind around the bend to end in an odd place. If you listen to his rants rather than choosing an option to fall asleep and skip them, you can even gain minor stat buffs, which was a funny surprise. Not every character is written to be friendly or chatty, though. Another one of my favorites, the doctor Fang, hardly talks at all and instead lets his raven X speak for him. He doesn't even accept gifts until you're able to convince him otherwise through persistence and eventual side quests. The side quests in question are almost always about a character's background or ambitions, or both, and there wasn't a single one I felt was a waste of time. Completing some side quests is the only way to get access to new minigames and activities in Sandrock. Doing these extra tasks earns relationship points with the involved parties, which in turn leads to new dialogue lines, bonuses like the occasional gift or shop discounts, and the potential chance for romance. There are a whopping 21 romanceable characters in Sandrock and I'll admit it was hard to choose one person to woo. Getting closer to a character isn't only an opportunity to get an extra hand at your workshop in the future, but also leads to special relationship quests. Though it can take a bit of time to build up to friendship through gifting, daily chats, and completing quests or commissions, Sandrock does a stellar job with this system and relationship progress feels much faster than Portia's. I appreciated the extra challenge managing water brought. \u201c Aside from the obvious difference of featuring new characters, another major change from Portia to Sandrock is how the desert setting plays into the town's economy and other challenges. I love how water is a focal point of not only the story but also the gameplay itself. Water is essential for running your workshop \u2013 if the water tank is empty, the machines don't work. Water can actually be crafted by gathering dew from shrubbery or using a dew collector, or barrels of water can purchased from Sandrock directly. However, if something like, say, the town bridge blows up resulting in no water being imported, water prices rise significantly. Though I didn't struggle too much with the water economy, I appreciated the extra challenge it brought when considering how I wanted to expand my workshop. For instance, when I was first introduced to farming, my other workshop machines were forced to a halt as I had to use all my stored water for the plants. Since then, I've been able to manage the water needs of plants and machines much better. Seasons impact water usage too, with the cool days of winter requiring significantly less water for your machines. There's even the occasional sandstorm that alters the residents' schedules, which also causes completed workshop items to blow away and a buildup of sand on machines that needs to be cleaned in order for them to work efficiently. In addition to the new setting, Sandrock has a great number of quality-of-life improvements, including better menus, icons above creatures to indicate whether or not they're friendly or hostile, free sprinting rather than limiting sprinting with a stamina bar, the ability to save and leave at any point rather than having to wait to go to sleep, and so much more. One of the biggest improvements is being able to build and complete item requests with items stored away in chests back at your workshop rather than needing them actively on hand. There are tons of items coming and going and getting processed into new things constantly, so not having to meticulously manage each was a huge relief. And in addition to crafting items, farming, taking care of animals, relationship building, sandfishing (fish live in sandpools here), cooking, decorating my house, and mining, there's even more to do with minigames. Some of these pop up during special holiday events, but there are also one-off games to play at almost any time at the local game center. My favorite was a simple whack-a-mole with various difficulty settings that could be played with NPCs or solo. Another great one requires you to find constellations in a star-filled night sky based on NPC requests. One of the unlockable sand racing minigames could use some tweaking to make the steering better, but I appreciate it as an option for multiplayer competitions. Sandrock is truly jampacked with choices, and like with Portia, they're almost all fun in short bursts as you jump between them. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front. \u201c There's even more to do on top of all that; there are tons of upgrades, including ones that I still don't have for my horse, for my mining jetpack and sensor goggles, and for various machines throughout my workshop. There are still romances I have to pursue (of people not even in the town yet too!), and many more side quests. Even with as many hours as I have played and all the quests I've done, I still don't have my four skill trees completed (gathering, workshop, combat, and social). That said, I do wish some of the skills were geared toward the endgame rather than the first dozen hours or so. In the gathering tree, one is specifically for digging in piles of junk for resources, which is something you only need to do in the opening few hours. I put my early points toward skills that got me more in the long run instead, so that dirt pile skill still sits unlearned. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front, too. On PC, assets and textures pop-in noticeably unless you manually go in and bump the settings to the highest options, which isn't ideal for a game with relatively low recommended PC specs. Xbox had similar issues as well, though the performance or quality mode didn't help with the asset loading much. While that is more of a minor annoyance and is easy to get used to, I've seen other persistent visual bugs. I've watched conversations happen through my character's skull, shrubs fly oddly in the sky, and other weird interactions. There hasn't been anything game breaking as far as I've seen, but I hope we see the sheer number of weird visual bugs get patched out over time. PC Co-Op Multiplayer  Where the campaign asks for your help in saving Sandrock from economic collapse, Sandrock's multiplayer asks for your help in building up Sandrock from its basics. While currently exclusive to the PC version, I was shocked at first to see places like the general store, scrap yard, and even the train station and train tracks were missing from Sandrock entirely. There are rockslides and junk blocking shortcuts through town, too. Up to four players can work together to clean up the town and determine what new facilities get built. Town planner progression is paced first by the group's workshop level and then by resources required to build the facility and its potential upgrades. So, like the campaign, building prestige for yourself as a builder allows you to access more. It's still a solid system and a neat spin on the campaign. New facilities also mean new people in town. I can see myself trying to convince friends to help prioritize unlocking the buildings for characters I like most from the campaign. Other key differences include removing the need for sleeping by a certain time. In the campaign, you pass out immediately if the clock hits 3:00 AM, but players can keep at it in multiplayer for as long as they want. It rocks. Better yet, there's an added nap function that can be used once per in-game day that quickly refills stamina and health. The skill trees are completely different as well, and there's an excellent daily task system and achievements not present in the campaign that can earn you extra money and experience. The three daily challenges reset after an in-game day, too, and are the same (but not shared) across all players. Players also have to share a plot of land and money and can share resources and contribute parts to build items. Miranda's Favorite Farm/Town Life Games See All My Time at Sandrock Pathea Games My Time at Portia Pathea Games Stardew Valley ConcernedApe Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Animal Crossing: New Leaf Nintendo EAD Animal Crossing: Wild World Nintendo EAD Little Witch in the Woods Sunny Side Up Ooblets Glumberland One of the best things about Sandrock's co-op is that anyone can hop into the multiplayer town even if the person who hosted it is offline, which isn't the case for one of my favorites, Stardew Valley . There's even a board where you can leave messages to friends. I was also impressed by how difficulty in dungeons scale based on the number of people going in, and they did seem more challenging than in the campaign as a result. The chests in dungeons and around the world even have good loot, with fully built machinery and items that award stat bonuses to all when they're used as decor on workshop grounds. While I was only able to play a few hours of co-op multiplayer before this review, after my brief stint I'm determined to get lots more in. There's enough that's changed between multiplayer and the campaign to justify digging deep into both \u2013 besides, it's the perfect opportunity to choose a different person to romance, too."

        "Content": "Farming Simulator 2013 is one of the purest and most focused business simulations I\u2019ve ever played. You own a farm in a country town, and your only goal is to grow crops to make as money without any \u201cfinal objective\u201d to chase. There are no scores, storylines, cosmetic money sinks (such as new player skins or houses), or other long-term goals. You simply choose a crop from four possible seeds to start your career, plant it in your field, harvest it, sell it and put that cash back into the farm. It\u2019s almost impossible to damage your crops unless you\u2019re not paying attention, so it\u2019s difficult to fail or find yourself in a no-win situation. Still, you should harvest as much as you can because of the sheer number of investments you can make into your business. There are dozens of licensed vehicles, forty plots of land (of which you only start with one), and additional buildings such as solar collectors and greenhouses that you can sink your money into. As you increase the number of fields you own, it can take more than a dozen tractors and tools to coordinate all the work and minimize downtime. It could take hundreds of hours of work to afford everything, but you have complete freedom in how you accomplish your goal and what your priorities are. Livestock, more or bigger fields, and faster machines are all available, so you\u2019ll have to think about what best suits your particular play style. More valuable crops take extra work and extra machines in order to maximize your profits, so you need to decide whether you\u2019re willing to make the investment or stick to simple but low-value crops. The entire system gives you a tremendous amount of freedom in how to best approach your business, although that first week will be fairly slow-paced. The most unusual aspect of Farming Simulator 2013 is the complete lack of competition. In a single-player career, there is only you, the farm, and the AI townspeople who wander around but can\u2019t be interacted with. Even in multiplayer, all players work together on a single farm. In both modes, the game will not fail you for slow production or even no production at all. As a result the gameplay is incredibly peaceful, though possibly a bit daunting for newcomers to the series. Admittedly, the act of virtual farming doesn\u2019t sound like it would require a complex series of steps to perform, given that most of your job involves jumping in a tractor, attaching a tool, and slowly driving in straight lines. However, there are subtleties that are under-mentioned or completely undocumented that require some practice to master. AI-controlled workers can be hired for most tasks, and watching how they perform can teach you techniques to use when you get behind the wheel. Hiring those workers is the key to running a successful and profitable farm, especially when you\u2019re trying to manage a half-dozen fields or more at once. The tutorials will help smooth out the learning curve, but the lessons are a mixed bag. All the tutorials focus solely on controls rather than techniques or theories. By the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll know exactly how to drive all your vehicles but not other essential tasks. For example, there are five selling points for your crops around the town, and each accepts different freight. The map doesn\u2019t tell you what each building is, so you\u2019ll have to drive around to learn the lay of the land. The map itself is huge, so you may get mixed up when you first start out. It\u2019s a step backwards; the previous game in the series featured a tutorial that had you take a tour of the town and learn what exactly the buildings did, so it\u2019s strange that it\u2019s not included in this version. Those aren\u2019t the only presentation missteps. To help keep you busy during those slow early days, you\u2019re given regular \u201cmissions\u201d to earn you some extra cash. There is no punishment for failing a mission, and they pay really well when you\u2019re starting out, but they\u2019re executed poorly. There are only two types of missions that ask you to mow some grass or move heavy equipment across the town. The problem is, you don\u2019t have the equipment to perform either mission when you start off with a new career, so you\u2019ll be forced to decline the mission unless you spend all your first-day profits on the machines. Further, the mission types seem a little strange\u2026 no missions for delivering certain crops to certain houses? No scrambling to save a field from a pest outbreak? How about a mission where you have to drive your water trailer to assist the fire department to help extinguish a burning building? While reward money is good, mowing grass is incredibly boring, and the mission system simply doesn\u2019t feel rewarding enough. Despite the documentation and information the developers failed to provide, the community is incredibly friendly and helpful. It takes a certain kind of mentality to play Farming Simulator at length, and that mentality doesn\u2019t lend itself to griefers or trolls. As a result, you can hop into any public game or browse the forums to find dozens of people ready to help you learn the basics and answer your questions. I\u2019ve joined several multiplayer games of Farming Simulator 2013 blindly and never encountered any player who was unwilling to share helpful tips. Up to nine other players can join a farm that the host has taken online, and all those hands can make a serious difference in how much work gets done. Players can be instantly kicked or banned by the host, and any vehicle or tool can be reset with two clicks of the mouse in the map view, so there is simply no room for players who won\u2019t behave. All money earned goes to the farm owner (the host of the game), so other players are there just to help out and socialize. Without competition in any form, and because any save file can be used in single- or multiplayer, all players naturally gravitate toward helping each other accomplish goals in their farms. It\u2019s a relaxing environment that encourages teamwork and communication above all else. Graphically, Farming Simulator 2013 is quite far behind the curve, but I suspect no one is getting it for state-of-the-art beauty. All the machines look good and are fantastically animated, but the environment is full of low resolution textures and low-polygon-count objects. It looks better than the previous game in the series, but that\u2019s not saying much. While the graphics are serviceable for the most part, there are blatant draw-in lines that make for some ugly moments. You can\u2019t adjust your draw-in distance in the option screen, so even if you have a top of the line computer, you won\u2019t be able to stand on a hill and watch amber waves of grain sway in the breeze. In fact, while you can usually tell what\u2019s going on with your farm just by the textures, certain states of the land (such as whether it\u2019s wet with fertilizer) are actually cut off with those short-distance draw-in lines. That means you won\u2019t be able to know exactly how much a particular field has grown unless you\u2019re practically on top of it. The map view helps offset this problem, but it\u2019s still a problem that can\u2019t be ignored. There is no music to speak of, and any sounds in the game are limited to the engines of your vehicles. This helps sell the atmosphere, but your ears may be a little bored. Your best bet is to put on some music while you play. As with previous entries in the franchise, Farming Simulator 2013 has mod support for future machines, maps, livestock, or buildings. Although mods were sorely lacking for the American release of the previous game, there were several large official DLC releases, so hopefully more content will be available in the coming months."

And now we\u2019re back, in outer space\u2026 okay, okay, don\u2019t leave! I\u2019ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order\u2019s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this. Especially considering that there\u2019s no reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven\u2019t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired \u2013 there\u2019s no corny amnesia or other, \u201cOh no, my powers are gone!\u201d gimmick to make you re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as we left him five years prior. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch has been rocky, especially on the PC version, which Respawn has publicly apologized for and already begun to patch . Before you buy it, make sure to watch our in-depth Performance review. So we\u2019re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape. You\u2019re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that\u2019s just the beginning \u2013 the Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with your double-jump, things really take off \u2013 you can cover such crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was possible. It\u2019s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles. Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star Wars melee battles I\u2019ve ever seen. You don\u2019t even have to be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids \u2013 not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded \u2013 makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations. Lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. \u201c After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that answers the question of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if Han Solo were also a Jedi?\u201d The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy broadsword that\u2019s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor, while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in close. It\u2019s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning slash to cut them all down like blades of grass.

You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own skill tree, so you\u2019re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no regrets. By the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorite stances, and no regrets. \u201c It\u2019s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate what\u2019s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That\u2019s very much in keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for a game like this, it seldom feels like there\u2019s a lot of time pressure to rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you\u2019re presented with by locals doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re neglecting a responsibility to save the galaxy. What We Said About Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order It\u2019s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. \u2013 Dan Stapleton, November 14, 2019 Score: 9 Read the full Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order review Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain unspoiled here, but they\u2019re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away. In any case, at least they\u2019re written and acted with enough depth that they don\u2019t feel like retreads of anyone Cal\u2019s faced before, and neither is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There\u2019s more to them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot for the most part. The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force. \u201c The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan\u2019s Cal is not so easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about more than simply fighting the Empire now: it\u2019s about whether he can live a life where he\u2019s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of his guilt, and find a home that\u2019s safe. His path after escaping Order 66 is contrasted against what could\u2019ve been if he\u2019d had different priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much more realized protagonist this time around. Every IGN Star Wars Game Review 113 Images Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal\u2019s side, but the rest of the crew are all given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and why they\u2019re coming back together now. Greez\u2019s loveable cantankerousness made him a favorite, and he\u2019s happy to deliver more of that along with some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his \u201cgrab some seat\u201d catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she\u2019s less of a constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. Cere's power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor\u2019s biggest action moments. \u201c Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of the group is Bode. He\u2019s another roguish mercenary type who, much like Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the two bro it up to establish the friendship they\u2019ve struck up fighting the Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however, he does become a more interesting companion. Dan's favorite Star Wars games I've been playing Star Wars games since the late 80s - here are my picks. See All Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Aspyr Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Obsidian Entertainment Star Wars: TIE Fighter LucasArts Star Wars: Empire at War Petroglyph Star Wars Battlefront II [2005] Pandemic Studios Star Wars: Dark Forces LucasArts Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Vicarious Visions Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Respawn Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Respawn Star Wars: The Force Unleashed -- Ultimate Sith Edition LucasArts Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor\u2019s single most thrilling action sequence). They can\u2019t be killed or downed in action so there\u2019s no management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy while you thin out his friends\u2019 ranks. Beyond that, they\u2019re only really used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1\u2019s adorable bleeps and bwoops couldn\u2019t do alone. Survivor takes advantage of that fact that it takes place at the midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. \u201c Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial Inquisitors it\u2019s a relief to see that the Empire\u2019s role here is more in the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are mostly here to provide variety after you\u2019ve been fighting the main enemy army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It\u2019s a clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy enemies together into the same game \u2013 one that takes advantage of the fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. There\u2019s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen Order \u2013 no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It\u2019s a good mix of enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order\u2019s already respectable lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I\u2019d temporarily Force-confused to my side) it\u2019s a great time. On the subject of creatures, one of Cal\u2019s many new abilities is to tame non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn\u2019t ever used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than Cal could\u2019ve run on foot. Given that running doesn\u2019t drain his stamina, it seems that it\u2019s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There\u2019s also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very specific points, so it\u2019s not much of a game-changer either, but it does play nicely into environmental puzzles. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor. \u201c Speaking of environments, this journey takes us to a handful of never-before-seen planets, some of which are expansive and include a variety of extremely different areas within them. Koboh, for instance, has everything from grasslands to swamp to underground facilities, a massive crashed Separatist ship, and even its own version of Cloud City. They\u2019re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor that are either 100 percent desert or completely covered in redwoods, respectively. Every time I entered a new area I\u2019d circle the camera, looking for the telltale signs the level designers leave to indicate a wall is runnable, a ceiling can be clung to, a crack can be squeezed through, and more. By the time I was done with my 30-hour run through the story I had trouble even remembering to use all of the abilities I had learned because there are simply so many. Levels are meticulously thought-out puzzles in and of themselves, and only rarely did I run across something that didn\u2019t feel intuitive or fair once I took into account all the tools at my disposal. The Enemies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor 11 Images Considering that this adventure is roughly equal parts combat and puzzle-solving, the fact that there\u2019s such a broad selection of types works in its favor. Puzzles that deal with directing energy beams and even painting paths are clever and well done, on par (and sharing some ideas) with a lot of what we saw in God of War Ragnarok last year. Some involve using BD-1 to launch projectiles to trigger remote switches, some have rolling homing bombs, and some use deployable balloons you can grapple to and launch off of. A few of the main storyline puzzles gave me cause to scratch my head for a few minutes before the solution sprung to mind, which is just about the right level of challenge. They aren\u2019t groundbreaking in their design, but consistently fun nonetheless. Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game. \u201c Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game with beautifully detailed environments and characters\u2026 and perhaps as a result, not one of the best performing. My PS5 playthrough saw some fairly gnarly slowdowns from the expected 30 frames per second in 4K Quality Mode, especially when fighting around smoke or fog, which made timing by parries and dodges difficult. Disappointingly, even the 1440p Performance Mode isn\u2019t close to holding a locked 60fps. I also saw a few crashes and bugs that forced me to quit and reload my save to progress (though this was before the day one patch). EA has naturally promised more patches will come with improvements on all platforms, but if history is any guide it might take a little while before it\u2019s completely ironed out. A smooth frame rate is certainly important when battling Survivor\u2019s multiple lightsaber-wielding bosses, because there\u2019s no shortage of challenge in learning the timing of parrying their strikes and dodging their unblockable attacks. I must confess: after several hours of banging my head against the brutal final boss I finally resorted to turning the difficulty down a notch to see the ending in time for this review, which hurt my pride because I\u2019d made it to his final phase but couldn\u2019t quite get over the finish line. That said, there\u2019s not a lot that felt especially novel about these fights; they\u2019re well made, but conventional and one aspect that hasn\u2019t seen a great improvement from Fallen Order. One smart tweak that does stand out, however, is that when a boss kills you, the next time you come at him he\u2019s not glowing yellow signifying you\u2019ll get your health back the first time you hit him like a normal enemy does. Instead, there\u2019s a glowing pillar of light where you fell, and picking that up heals you. That allows you to save the full-health pick-up for when you need it rather than just as the fight begins \u2013 it\u2019s a smart and welcome evolution of Fallen Order\u2019s already ingenious system of tipping the scales in your favor when you need it. I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack. \u201c When it comes to tracking those bosses down in the first place, I certainly appreciate that the Jedi games give you a map (unlike other games of this style that I could name that delight in making you figure it out) but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to usability. Just like in Fallen Order, this map seems so dedicated to the idea of resembling a light-blue Star Wars hologram that it\u2019s not always easy to figure out what you\u2019re looking at and the directions its waypoints give you aren\u2019t always accurate. However, its dotted lines were generally good enough to point me in the right direction when I struggled to find a path forward or was feeling lost, or redirect me when I was trying to figure out a way past an obstacle I didn\u2019t have the right gear for yet. Also, this time Respawn has granted us the ability to fast-travel between save points, which feels like an act of mercy when the objective is on the other side of one of these large, labyrinthian maps. These maps are dense, too, and Survivor is packed full of stuff to do around the edges of the main story, including bounty hunters and legendary creatures to track down and kill, combat challenges, and more. Some of them are seriously tough, even on the default Jedi Knight difficulty level; I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor\u2019s grab-and-snack attack, other than that it was literally dozens. But I got him in the end! You\u2019ll also unlock a full New Game+ mode once you beat the story, which is a welcome feature that Fallen Order didn\u2019t have until more than six months after launch. Top 10 Soulslikes 11 Images On top of all of that, there\u2019s an intimidating amount of stuff to collect, including plants and fish which can then be displayed in the cantina in your base town on Koboh. But while there might be some unlocks at the end of those sidequests, it doesn\u2019t do much to convince you that these are activities you should spend a lot of time on\u2026 unless you really like plopping down seeds on rooftop gardens or watching a virtual aquarium. Of course some rewards are much more enticing to a Star Wars fan. Cal\u2019s lightsaber and blaster both have many customizable cosmetic parts that you can mix and match to form your own creation, and even though you can barely make out those details when you\u2019re using it in a fight unless you zoom in with the photo mode, it\u2019s a fantastic, loving bit of Star Wars detail to obsessively mess with whenever you find a new piece. Plus, all of the available lightsaber blade colors are unlocked shortly after the start so that you can make Cal more your own from the very beginning. That also goes for his range of clothing options, which is far more extensive this time around, as well as his entirely new haircut and beard options. He\u2019ll always be the same Cal Kestis underneath it, but your soul-patch and mullet-wearing character will have a very different vibe from mine, whose crew cut and beard resembles a redheaded version of Amos Burton from The Expanse. Yes, it\u2019s a little silly to find hair and beard options in treasure chests, but sure, why not? Similarly, I\u2019m just delighted at the customization for BD-1. In the first game, you could only change his paint job, but his enduring popularity (which led to his Mandalorian cameo) has paid dividends because now we get many more options for components on his face, head, \u201cears,\u201d body, and legs, as well as detailed color options and even the level of wear and tear. Just wait until you see the way his body reacts to having pieces swapped out in the customization menu! It\u2019s another lovely little touch in a game that presents so many.

        "Content": "Somewhere in Harvest Moon: One World there's a really interesting seed of an idea for a new take on farming sims, which would be much appreciated after 25 years of very similar games. And in the right hands, turning a farming simulator series into a plot-driven, exploration-focused adventure game sounds like a brilliant idea. And yet One World fails in just about every way to do anything interesting or innovative with this new idea other than layer it on top of a deeply mediocre farming sim. Unlike its numerous Harvest Moon predecessors and competitors, One World does not have you inherit an old farm in a dying village and spend years rebuilding them, getting to know your neighbors, and generally settling down. Rather, you\u2019re handed a portable farm (your scientist neighbor turns up on your doorstep and says \u201cLook, I made you a portable farm\u201d and that\u2019s the end of the discussion) in the first 10 minutes and sent off on an adventure across its world, through five different towns with their own climates, hazards, and problems. You'll park your farm in one spot for a season, finish whatever local plot is in front of you, and then move on. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask But the one world of One World is boring in every way. Everything looks bland, except for the named character models, which are exactly fine. Towns are dull and empty with just a couple identical houses each, the areas between them are mostly long and same-ish paths, and everything just looks flat and simple. There's no detail, no personality \u2013 just long stretches of empty space, maybe with a tree thrown in if you're lucky. There's no detail, no personality \u2013 just long stretches of empty space.It also sometimes does not work correctly. Sound frequently sputters when you\u2019re moving from area to area. Characters and objects appear and disappear from existence \u2013 sometimes on purpose according to their respective schedules, but sometimes just because they're not loading in fast enough. It\u2019s especially bad when you're riding your horse. As much as I despise calling anything \"X-era graphics,\" the GameCube version of Harvest Moon was far more detailed and exciting to look at than this. (But then, that was before the original developer went off to make Story of Seasons instead ). The aesthetics of One World are not where the mundanity ends. Unlike other Harvest Moon games where you get to know a town of distinct and personable neighbors, there are few actual developed characters in One World outside of its roster of bachelors and bachelorettes and one other named character in each area. The vast majority of the cast is made up of same-looking individuals with names like \"Awkward Man\" or \"Thoughtful Woman\" whose only personality trait is sending you endless mail to ask you to bring them random items. And that\u2019s a terrible idea because again, these characters tend to disappear completely at certain times of day, sometimes right in front of your eyes, and sometimes as you\u2019re about to turn in a quest. Harvest Moon: One World Sreenshots 6 Images The bachelors and bachelorettes have a bit more going for them in the personality department, but are still largely pretty samey in the end. They all care about their respective towns, they need your help saving them, and they think the main character is neat. For the most part, they are distinguished almost entirely by their looks and what town they hang out in the most. Marrying one is inconsequential, seeming almost like an afterthought gated behind a lot of time spent in the extremely boring mines and, for some reason, finishing the main plot \u2013 you can't get married until then. You can have a kid eventually too, but your offspring take after your spouse\u2019s side of the family in that they do nothing interesting whatsoever. Marrying someone is inconsequential, seeming almost like an afterthought.Oh, and you can't be queer, despite Harvest Moon's competitors Story of Seasons and Stardew Valley having recognized what year it is already. The developers say this feature was missed due to COVID-19 , and that it will be present in future games, but it's still massively frustrating when so many other games offer it. And since One World doesn't really signal to you who is and isn't dateable for quite a while, I spent a lot of time handing gifts to Kirsi for no reason. A definitive ranking of all people you can marry in Harvest Moon: One World: Bachelors 1: Kanoa 2: Sami 3: Tristan 4: Jamil 5: Braden Bachelorettes 1: Kirsi 2: Laura 3: Ahina 4: Malika 5: Gabrielle With an empty world and a soulless cast, that leaves the actual farming to carry One World\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t. The Harvest Goddess is, as usual in Harvest Moon games, absent, which has caused everyone in the world to just forget how farming and seeds work. So instead of buying seeds at the store, you have to hunt them down. Harvest Wisps scattered throughout the world will hand you one seed per day per wisp, meaning much of your ability to actually use your farm is also tied to exploring the world. One World's farming has several interesting new ideas that might have made for an exciting new direction.And like the exploration angle, One World's farming has several interesting new ideas that might have made for an exciting new direction had it been handled differently. For instance, each crop has certain seasons and regions of the world it grows better in. You can still plant crops off-season or in other areas, but they'll grow more slowly \u2013 or become different crops entirely. Eggplant grown outside of its favored zone might become a White Eggplant, or a Tomato may become an Ice Tomato in the snowy region. Which farming game or series from the last decade is your favorite? Harvest Moon Story of Seasons Rune Factory Stardew Valley Farming Simulator Answer See Results There's a lot of potential here for fun experimentation with where you put your farm and what you grow and when, but it's never realized. The problem with all this is that nothing is ever really explained. After 20+ hours into One World, with the Harvest Goddess resurrected and the main story finished, I'm still not entirely clear how they work. There's no real log that indicates exactly how to get which mutations even after you've already obtained them, and even if you plant the same crop in the same region at the same time, it doesn't always seem to mutate. I'm sure there's a trick here I'm missing, and while mutations are largely inconsequential (I've been able to find seeds for all the mutations I've made so far separately as well), it's really frustrating if you're trying to grow, say, an Asparagus from regular Asparagus seeds for a quest, but keep getting Purple Asparagus instead and have no idea why. Even if you plant the same crop in the same region at the same time, it doesn't always seem to mutate.One World lacks clear instruction throughout, often placing you into frustrating situations without a way out. One later quest that\u2019s critical to the story wanted me to gather four of a certain kind of sheep wool... but there were only three slots in my barn at the time and they were already taken up by a cow, a horse, and a regular sheep. No matter what, I would need to purchase the special sheep required to get this wool and wait multiple in-game weeks for it to become an adult and produce the wool. But I would also either have to get rid of one of my other animals to make space for it in my barn, or expand my barn \u2013 which I had no idea how to do at the time. Barn expansion turns out to be gated behind a long series of fetch quests that give no indication building expansion is at the end of them. That was just one example, but this obtuse quest and upgrade design became a frustrating hindrance repeatedly throughout One World, with many progression quests requiring specific seeds or tool upgrades and no hint at all as to where those might be found. Your best bet, outside of a guide online, is just to talk to everyone constantly and repeatedly and do every single quest possible until you accidentally stumble over the thing you're looking for. Why can't my dog go outside?I haven\u2019t yet mentioned all the many small annoyances that cropped up as I played, none of which are worth a paragraph on their own but all contributed to my growing ball of frustration with One World. Why can I not have more than one stack of a single item in my storage or inventory at a time? Why does my stamina drop constantly just from walking around? Is there any point to giving gifts to random nameless NPCs? Why can't my dog go outside? Why does keeping my animals happy seemingly do nothing at all, and why do they drop dead after a year or so automatically? The best I can say about One World is that it's fine \u2013 something you can mindlessly play on mute with a podcast on and feel not-horrible about. That said, with two Story of Seasons games out within a month of this and Stardew Valley's 1.5 update on top of that, I can\u2019t think of a reason why anyone who loves the Harvest Moon tradition should play One World. It's lacking just about every possible forward-moving feature any similar games have, and its attempts at doing something new with the series are half-baked and frustrating."

Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]   Each time I start up a new farm in Stardew Valley or return to my 100-hour save on PC, I feel like I\u2019m going home. There\u2019s a comfort in Stardew Valley that I\u2019ve rarely found in other games. The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town, and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land\u2019s mysteries. Whether you want to farm, fish, fight monsters, craft, mine, become everyone\u2019s best friend, or do a little bit of everything, this farming adventure has plenty to offer. As we said in our original review , Stardew Valley \u201cbeautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements to create an intriguing, absorbing rural world,\u201d and it\u2019s only gotten better with each massive free update. Multiplayer, new items, buildings, farm types, events, and relationships give Stardew Valley an even better foundation and more of a reason to stick around past the coveted event in the third in-game year. The five new farm maps offer better focus for players than when Stardew Valley first launched. Each of the farms\u2019 designs encourages different types of work \u2013 farming, fishing, foraging, mining, and combat. Each map\u2019s activities are a relief from the grips of Joja Corporation, the cold, in-game company that encroaches on Pelican Town. Stardew Valley\u2019s story is a simple, yet satisfying one. You inherit your grandfather\u2019s farm after leaving the grind of your job with the Joja Corporation. Once settled on the farm, you then have to decide whether to support the local Joja Mart or rebuild the decaying community center. This conflict is the driving factor in the two or so years that span Stardew Valley\u2019s story, but once that\u2019s all completed, befriending and learning about the townspeople introduce other contained stories. The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch. \u201c The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming bunch, though improving your relationship with each of them is rather superficial. All you have to do is give them presents they like twice a week to slowly earn their trust and affection. Giving them items they dislike can lower their affection level, so that at least encouraged me to try and figure out what each person enjoys most and to get creative with my gifts once I had some expendable resources well into my second year. That's right, Maru \u2014 you've been upgraded to pepper poppers. Despite the system\u2019s simplicity, it\u2019s still rewarding to learn about each person's dreams, passions, and challenges living in Stardew Valley. There\u2019s a friendly monster who just wants to sell his merchandise to nice people, an artist who\u2019s a little too shy to share her artwork, a bitter old man who\u2019s hesitant to make connections, a scientist who studies the valley\u2019s wildlife, and plenty other interesting folks.  After reaching certain friendship or romance levels, a special character scene plays if you catch them in the right time and place. The 12 romanceable characters have more scenes than others, and if you choose to marry one, they move into your home and actually help around the farm every now and then. It\u2019s a welcome benchmark for the late game. NPCs are also the key to learning certain food recipes and crafting blueprints, so there\u2019s value in befriending them beyond discovering their interests and personal conflicts. They\u2019ll even send a small gift back to you occasionally. Sprouting Charm The changing of seasons in Stardew Valley is perhaps one of the most exciting events. Where summer has plenty of sunny days with a few useful thunderstorms here and there \u2013 with the right tools, you can make batteries with the lighting! \u2013 the snow-covered ground in winter prevents any crops growing outside, leaving the season\u2019s activities a little more up in the air if you\u2019re primarily a farmer. Every season has its own enjoyable pace that comes with the varying weather, crop types, NPC schedules, birthdays, fish, and fun festivals that keep things engaging. Each season runs for 28 days, so figuring out how to best spend them is a great challenge as each in-game year passes. By the time I reached the end of my second year, I felt confident in my daily routine and farming strategies. Farming isn\u2019t overly complex, but the methodical nature of it is relaxing. It does take a fair bit of time in the first year to make enough money to get a good number of the best seeds, optimize your farmland, implement a watering system, and figure out a routine to take care of it all. Stardew Valley has levels for each main mechanic \u2013 farming, fishing, mining, combat, and foraging. Figuring out how to make the most of my days was a great challenge early on when I had a low energy meter for executing actions like chopping wood, tilling soil, and using the watering can, all without extra farming bonuses from my level. But even when that energy meter grew and I earned farming specializations, the difficulty and enjoyment I found in farming came from managing more land and deciding whether or not to process the farmed goods to make them into more profitable artisan goods or do something else with them entirely. For instance, I could sell all my grapes, cook them for my own consumption for energy and health, or I could save them to make jelly or wine with the craftable preserves jar and keg. Adding farm animals to the mix made for even more welcome diversity in my daily farming routine. Even with the big updates, Stardew Valley still has the mild problem of having so much to do with little explanation for how to do it, but there certainly is a joy to creating your own routines and discovering what works best for how you want to play. The in-game TV show Living off the Land provides good tips on mechanics and seasonal changes, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of help on how to use some of the less straightforward items. For instance, a great new item picks up all products from goats, cows, and sheep, but I had to use a guide to figure out how to actually get it to work. On the other hand, new items like the planter pot make the early game a little easier. It allows the player to grow any plant per pot indoors regardless of the season, making it especially helpful for completing some early important challenges and requests from villagers that are easy to miss once a season ends. When I wasn\u2019t farming or petting farm animals, I was foraging for the season\u2019s natural goods (which is as simple as walking around and picking them off the ground) or fishing. Stardew Valley tracks everything you\u2019ve had in your collection, so there\u2019s definitely an incentive to try each main activity. Unlike farming, where you need to buy seeds to grow the next thing on the list, there\u2019s a strict schedule to when certain fish are available, and some of them are incredibly difficult to catch. The fishing minigame itself is easygoing fun for the small fries but can be a little frustrating for some of the more rare fish. Still, that challenge is something I\u2019m looking forward to conquering eventually once I craft enough of the right tackles and stock up on bait to lure the rare beasts in. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I\u2019m very into it. \u201c Mining and combat, on the other hand, are a little more straightforward. The main mine has a handful of enemies that progressively get stronger with each of its 100 levels, and an additional cavern in an unlockable area houses even more difficult monsters and a seemingly infinite number of floors. Spelunking through the main cave is a dangerous endeavor early on, but obtaining better weapons and armor through the shop, chests, enemy drops, or through reaching new combat levels make it more manageable. The combat consists of simple button mashing to swing a sword, so pairing monster fights with the challenge of descending into a mine makes it a lot more fun and rewarding. The added difficulty of getting out of the mine before your character passes out at 2:00 a.m. also puts the pressure on for making it through the caves as efficiently as possible. Then, there are challenges from a group called the Adventurer's Guild to clear a certain number of the more popular monster types, so there\u2019s yet another incentive to descend the mines to slay monsters. Oh, and there\u2019s even more collecting involved as you mine old and strange artifacts that can be donated to the local museum for even more rewards. Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting, and I\u2019m very into it. Regardless of their varying complexity, progression through all five skills is constant and rewarding. In addition to that basic fulfillment, just about every skill level has some sort of craftable reward and helps build your proficiency, or lowers the amount of energy required to use a tool. At skill levels five and 10, you get to specialize your character further by choosing professions that give bonus stats to certain actions. For example, a rancher gets more gold from animal products, but tillers sell crops at a higher price. That profession is refined further at level 10. I\u2019m halfway into my third year in Stardew Valley and I still haven\u2019t finished getting all my skills to level 10. Like with real life, there\u2019s potential to do a lot in a day, but how it\u2019s spent is entirely up to you. When you add someone else to your farm, though, those days can be a whole lot more productive. Ripened Co-Op Multiplayer is a fantastic addition to Stardew Valley that entirely changes how the game can be played. As expected, it helps you accomplish far more in a day if you have a cooperative farmhand, but does so without feeling too much like a cheat code. When a friend joins they get their own home (that the main player can enter and customize) and have to start a new character from scratch. This means they have low energy, weak starting tools, hardly any crafting recipes, and no skill perks. While it would have been nice to have the option to import a character with all its stats and upgraded tools \u2013 maybe even at a cost \u2013 starting fresh is the more balanced trade-off for having multiple people on a farm. You share money with up to three farmhands/friends who can meddle in your belongings, so it\u2019s not entirely too difficult to get new players up to speed if you\u2019re adding them to an established farm. Still, having to support others\u2019 endeavors out of your pocket helps multiplayer maintain that balance between difficulty and power, and you can even change the profit margins for your co-op save if you feel like you\u2019re making too much money. The updates added some incredibly useful but expensive items, so I definitely haven't complained about making more gold every day. If you\u2019re starting a new farm together, I could see how splitting up each task could make that first challenging year easier to take on, and maybe even more fun. Someone who prefers to fish or mine could focus on that while someone who likes farming could look after the crops.  Farmhands have ownership over their cabin and relationships with NPCs in your game, too, which is an important incentive for helping out a friend on their farm since it gives them both a stake in your land and in the rest of your game, too. They can upgrade their home and even get married to your character or an NPC you haven\u2019t romanced. It might be a bit tedious to have to go through the whole courting process again if you\u2019ve already unlocked everything on your primary farm, but I appreciate that it offers a chance to start a new romance with a different character and to essentially establish a new life on a farm that can progress while you\u2019re not there if the primary farmer chooses to play without you. My friend was incredibly helpful in kicking off the summer farming season as we toiled away for days leading up to it, calculating how many seeds of a specific fruit we\u2019d need. Communication happens through a simple in-game text chat that\u2019s equipped with plenty of great emojis. It ended up being an expensive season because of all the seeds I had to buy, but that investment my friend suggested has definitely paid off. Though his farming suggestions were helpful, spelunking with him was even more fun. Together we slayed plenty of monsters and got further in the challenge cavern than I had before. The easygoing nature of Stardew Valley also creates a wonderfully pleasant space to hang out with friends, which is a nice thing to have when so many multiplayer games are set in rather tense situations."

        "Content": "The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit may not be particularly adventurous, per se, but it has heart on its side. This free Life is Strange prequel episode centers on the relationship between a wonderfully imaginative boy and his emotionally withdrawn father, but for all the depth and humanity of its storytelling it lacks enough tough challenges or meaningful decisions to make participating feel exciting.  Dontnod\u2019s two-hour game revolves around an innocently charming nine-year-old named Chris Erikson and his imaginary alter ego Captain Spirit as he copes with the death of his mother. The father-son dynamic is the emotional center of the story and certainly succeeded at moving me; Chris' father, Charles, clings to his basketball glory days and his beer and vents his sadness by yelling at Chris and leaving fist-sized dents in doors. (I happened to play Awesome Adventures soon after completing Detroit: Become Human, and the similar elements have me slightly concerned that \u201cdads with substance abuse problems who scream at their children\u201d is a troubling new gaming subgenre.) Though the story isn\u2019t notably innovative, it\u2019s engaging enough that I was never bored.   Most of the gameplay consists of searching the house and crossing items off of Chris\u2019 list of titular \u201cAwesome Things to Do\u201d while his father watches a basketball game on TV. The house itself feels appropriately barren to match the family\u2019s grief and the one person you can interact with doesn\u2019t want to interact with you, which made me feel just as lonely as Chris. Beneath the empty surface, the house is filled with little touches that help establish the mood: a perfume bottle left behind, unopened Christmas decorations, and little cartoons drawn by Chris' mom. You don\u2019t need to have played Life is Strange or its Before the Storm prequel to enjoy Captain Spirit, but there are some Easter eggs that you\u2019ll miss if you\u2019re unfamiliar with them.  In his bedroom, Chris\u2019 only limit is his imagination. \u201c The snowy setting and cool color palette succeed in draining the warmth from every room in the home except Chris\u2019 bedroom, which is happy and vibrant because of the sunlight filtering in. Considering that this is probably the way Chris views his own home, it's a nice touch. In his bedroom, Chris\u2019 only limit is his imagination. His toys and posters make the place feel like a safe haven and I loved watching him play in that space.  Captain Spirit\u2019s story is revealed almost solely through exploration. As you climb up a treehouse and snoop through Charles' wardrobe, you slowly learn how Chris' mom passed away and just how poorly Charles has been dealing with it. I felt accomplished having pieced things together, which went a ways toward making up for the lack of gameplay achievements available.  Chris\u2019 imagination is often represented by a mechanic where looking at certain objects unlocks Captain Spirit's \u201cpowers,\u201d which also makes the controller vibrate for longer than I wanted it to and with obnoxious frequency. For example, you can stare at a log in a fireplace to \u201cmake it erupt in flames,\u201d something that reminded me of that Super Bowl commercial with the kid dressed as Darth Vader who thought he could use the Force. The \u201cpower\u201d mechanic makes some sense in the log example, but it makes less sense to have to call upon superpowers to just put on a cape. Though it's usually annoying, seeing Chris\u2019 imagination in action is endearing enough that I generally forgave it. Captain Spirit hits the nail on the head when it comes to capturing the mind of a kid.  21 Images  This is the most beautiful scenery I\u2019ve ever seen in a Life is Strange game. \u201c The items on Chris\u2019 list of awesome things range from fighting \u201cThe Snowmancer\u201d \u2013 a snowman in the backyard decorated with cigarette butts \u2013 to hitting beer cans with snowballs (a cute nod to the original Life is Strange) to defeating Captain Spirit's arch nemesis, the evil \u201cMantroid.\u201d I had expected that confrontation to be the climax of the story, but because you can cross the tasks off the list in any order I ended up facing him early. That was anticlimactic in of itself, and doubly so because the Mantroid encounter mostly consists of walking slowly forward while a scary voice taunts you and ends with little recognition of your accomplishment. On the other hand, this sequence takes place in the most beautiful scenery I\u2019ve ever seen in a Life is Strange game, so walking slowly forward gave me the time I needed to take it all in.  Disappointingly, none of these quests contain any of the difficult decisions that I\u2019ve come to expect from Life is Strange. There is an element of challenge because the puzzles require you to pay attention to the environment, but it\u2019s not enough to feel like a true adventure. However, if you stop looking at Captain Spirit as a standalone adventure and start looking at it as a prequel to Life is Strange 2, this lack of action makes more sense. It then becomes the calm before the inevitable storm rather than a lull itself.  The Awesome Adventures finally finds its tension in the last five minutes of gameplay with an event that, while interesting, occurs a little too abruptly and without adequate time for exploration. Then again, considering it ends in a \u201cto be continued\u2026\u201d cliffhanger screen, it\u2019s almost certain that Dontnod will explore it further in Life is Strange 2 (which debuts on September 27), and I definitely want to keep playing to find out more."

        "Content": "While many games generally have something at least somewhat meaningful to say about the world we live in (advertently or no), I often find myself a bit disconnected from the monumental settings so many protagonists are dropped into. Plenty of amazing games tell impactful stories about love, loss, hope, revenge, and so forth, but it's rare for something to dig at me in the small, deeply personal way that Chicory: A Colorful Tale has. And it's perhaps even rarer for that personal impact to be accompanied by the kind of fun, concise, self-aware, and encouraging little adventure that indie developer Greg Lobanov and his colleagues present. Chicory is best-described as a top-down Zelda-like adventure sans combat where the entire game is a giant coloring book. It follows a protagonist that you name after your favorite food who is the janitor and number-one fan of Chicory, the sole \"wielder\" of a magical brush used to color in the otherwise black-and-white world. But Chicory vanishes, and all the world's color goes with her. The protagonist, stumbling upon her brush, takes it up themself and begins filling the world's color back in. It's fun and games initially, but things quickly take a turn as you discover a growing darkness troubling your friends and neighbors which seemingly has ties to Chicory, and the brush itself.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Your adventure takes you across a world full of charming, food-named locales (towns of Luncheon and Brekkie, the Appie Foothills, Supper Woods, etc), progressing by solving puzzles connected to coloring in the black-and-white world. At the start, you'll only have basic draw/erase functions and four different colors pre-selected by the area you\u2019re in. But over time you'll get access to more tools via collectible \"brush styles,\" most of which are stamps (like stars or hearts) or patterns (dots, stripes) that will enhance your otherwise straightforward line drawing. The most important of these, a fill tool, is mercifully available early on. The rest of the brush styles are scattered around the world, serving as one of a handful of optional collectible challenges alongside a robust closet of hidden clothing options to find, decorative items you can set up anywhere, and a sidequest involving lost cat children. The paint tool of Chicory is more the core of its gameplay than its exploration is. \u201c Pleasant as the world is to uncover, the paint tool of Chicory is more the core of its gameplay than its exploration is. The world reacts to your paint, with puzzles requiring you to color thoughtfully to overcome obstacles, complete sidequests, and access hidden areas. Plants might grow into crossable platforms with paint applied, or shrink when erased so as not to block your path. Geysers of paint will shoot you across the map, color-filled mushrooms can be used as springboards, and bubbles filled with paint will explode, breaking flimsy rocks standing in your way. As you progress, you'll gain more powers, like the ability to paint flowing water and swim in it, climb paint-covered walls, or light up dark caves with glow-in-the-dark paint. What's your favorite Paint tool? Brush Fill Shapes Eraser Pencil Answer See Results What this ultimately results in is a very clever new layer to what would otherwise be pleasant but familiar top-down adventure puzzle-solving. Your paint is persistent; you'll always know where you've been and what you did there based on the splatters you left behind, making Chicory's world stressless and inviting to explore and fill in. It's worth revisiting areas, too, as in typical top-down adventure fashion you'll have powers later on that will unlock more hidden areas you couldn't access before, each containing treasures or little subplots that add further color and personality to Chicory's cast. What's more, characters will frequently ask you to paint or decorate things for them: houses, donuts, logos, furniture, and so forth. Some will have specific color requests, but for the most part they just want the thing done however you like it, and will react with delight to your work whether you're an auteur or amateur. Chicory recognizes that its audience may think they are god-awful at art. But it offers the tools and encouragement to try anyway. \u201c This is emblematic of all of Chicory: it is not a stressful or fast-paced game (apart from a few brief boss encounters). It's a thoughtful game that wants you to walk along with it at a pace that feels pleasant, with puzzles that require consideration but never strain, sidequests in measured but not overwhelming amounts, and plenty of fun things to discover or stumble upon that never feel mandatory or guilt-inducing if you miss them. It recognizes that its audience, me included, may think they are objectively god-awful at art. But then it offers the tools and encouragement to try anyway, and goes farther to challenge those self-effacing beliefs by rejoicing in thoughtful effort without judgment. Chicory does this in large ways through story scenes, but also in small ways, like having its funny and adorable NPCs pop up unexpectedly in areas you've been through before to admire the art you did there. An Interactive Coloring Book Whatever your skill level, Chicory is full of optional content inviting you to play around with its many built-in art tools. An art academy subplot lets you take art classes and attempt to recreate different pieces of art, with your recreations later posted and admired by NPCs around the world. If you're feeling limited by the four-color restriction per area, an NPC will eventually give you a brush style that lets you customize your colors with full freedom. You can also design your own brush style and clothing items. There's a built-in GIF-maker that lets you capture your painting process. And while you can paint any area however you like, there are multiple places set up in specific ways to invite explicit creativity, like a huge blank building you're asked to tag, or a mountain viewpoint where NPCs request you color a sky for them to admire. Oh, and because color is utterly unnecessary for anything other than fun aesthetic, Chicory is fully accessible to colorblind players. Furthermore, rarely do I encounter games that have so expertly grasped the precise amount of everything they need to have. All of Chicory, from its length (10 to 20 hours, depending on how much you paint and explore) to its quantity of sidequests and collectibles to the length and difficulty of its puzzles to the amount of dialogue and discovery is just right. Chicory never overstays its welcome, concludes all its moments in a satisfactory way, and offers more for those who wish it without guilting or pressuring you into pushing past natural stopping points. It is impressive in its exactness. All this alone would make for a very good game. It's difficult for me to explain why Chicory affected me so personally without getting into spoiler territory, but I think it's critical to highlight the story and character-centered reasons why it is elevated beyond being just a well-made Zelda-like with a clever paint tool. Chicory tells an earnest story about people who create things, and the ways in which being a creator impacts them. Though it's specifically about visual art, anyone who \"makes\" \u2014 whether that's artists of any school, or those like myself who fall more into the territory of \"craft\" rather than art \u2014 could easily find that something personal resonates with them here. Chicory is about characters who are intrinsically wedded to their work, and who also have their work on public display. \u201c Chicory is about characters who are intrinsically wedded to their work, and who also have their work constantly on public display, subject to the critique of absolutely everyone in the world at all times. Most of its citizens are kind and encouraging of your efforts, recognizing that you're in a tricky and unexpected situation. But that doesn't stop many of them from pointing out the flaws of past wielders, or even expressing nervous doubt in your own abilities as the implications of your job for everyone else get scarier. And as Chicory herself points out \u2013 and the story illustrates more pointedly later \u2013 while the pressure others put on you to do your job well is stressful on its own, it can be nothing compared to the pressure people put on themselves. Especially when they are following in the footsteps of someone they deeply admire. There's a lot of close-to-home reflection in Chicory on imposter syndrome, the relationship between mentors and mentees, how mental health struggles particularly impact creators, and how we are all so often our own worst critics. But there are also supporting characters with brief, sharp at times, but always kind commentary on topics like grief, workaholism, and the struggles of reckoning with sexuality and identity. It is at all times sensitive and empathetic, but doesn't sugar-coat or present a cheesy solution that magically erases the problems of all its protagonists, even in its conclusion. There's a lot of close-to-home reflection in Chicory on imposter syndrome, and how mental health struggles impact creators. \u201c And critically, its story is beautifully suited to its gameplay, with its paint mechanics both subtly and overtly highlighting its themes at every moment. For instance, Chicory has \"boss battles\" of a sort, where the painted darkness the protagonist faces not only takes the explicit forms of those it represents, but also more subtly reflects their actual art styles. In another example, the world remembers not just the paint you throw on the environment, but your more deliberate creations as well, resulting in emotional callbacks to your past work when you visit characters you've seen before and are clued into what your art has meant to them. Chicory is at all times illustrating exactly what it is fundamentally about in a way that I feel few games manage to fully express without veering into the far excesses of either lengthy cutscenes or gameplay challenges that kill story momentum and feeling. For all these reasons, on top of which I'll add Lena Raine's absolutely incredible soundtrack, I can enthusiastically recommend Chicory whether you consider yourself a \"maker\" or not. Chicory constantly asks its audience for understanding and empathy toward those whose work they consume. I've had a lot of complex feelings lately related to seeing those I admire most in my profession as human beings with flaws as well as virtues, and Chicory helped me process those while encouraging me to give them grace. But Chicory also wants me to give that same grace to myself. It was a reminder (without resorting to the overdone self-care language those with this flavor of anxiety have heard a hundred times before) that I am not defined by my work despite my constant insistence on treating myself as though I am. I can and should be kinder to myself. I needed to hear that."

It may feel like more of a Slime Rancher 1.5 at its early access release, but its presentation is still a night-and-day improvement over the original, the new slimes and areas are wonderful and unique, and movement and exploration both feel much better. All those upgrades combine to create a satisfying and zen-like adventure that made me want to retire from the rat race of battle royales and action games to settle down on a sticky pasture and live a simple life among the slimes. If you\u2019ve played the first Slime Rancher, even a little, then nothing about this work-in-progress sequel is likely to surprise you. As with the first entry, you\u2019ll run around chaotic and beautiful otherworldly environments as you collect resources and slimes, then head back to your home base to turn your jelly friends into profit just like Ayn Rand intended. You\u2019ll also fight gross, world-consuming Tarr slimes, upgrade your base of operations and your equipment, and fall off cliffs when you forget you don\u2019t have enough stamina to power your jetpack. The good news is that this formula of exploring, farming, and experimenting with your slimes and their crossbred permutations remains incredibly compelling, and it\u2019s easy to lose track of time while hanging out with this lovable gang of invertebrates.

That said, most of the slimes that are currently MIA were probably strategically cut fat, and the slimes that have been added are more than fair trades for those we lost; I don\u2019t particularly miss the irritating, radioactive Rad slimes, for example, while the new Ringtail slimes that skitter about killing things and get turned into stone if they get caught in the sun are hilarious little troublemakers. Still, it\u2019s weird that obvious stuff that would have been great to have at launch, like NPCs occupying the world or multiplayer options, have been completely eschewed for now. In its current form, Slime Rancher 2 is fairly light on content. \u201c In its current form, Slime Rancher 2 is fairly light on content in general. I began to feel like I was out of things to do after about a dozen hours, and I encountered areas that were incomplete or blocked off in some of my first moments of exploration. Luckily farming for slimes, gathering resources to upgrade your ranch, and exploring what areas you can access are all such wildly captivating activities that I spent well over that time just optimizing my farm and looking for secrets. You can also get a lot of mileage out of the returning crossbreeding mechanic, which merges two types of slimes together to create interesting and often ill-advised combinations, like the exploding crystal abominations I Frankensteined into existence. That\u2019s a rabbit hole that only got deeper over the course of the first game\u2019s developement, and I\u2019m excited to see if this adventure follows suit. Do you think a sequel needs to be more than more of the same? No, simply having more is often enough More of the same is fine as long as there are improvements Yes, sequels should bring some innovation It really depends on the game I don't care as long as it's good Answer See Results But despite the familiarity, it\u2019s impossible not to notice this sequel\u2019s higher level of polish. If the original was a compelling and memorable proof of concept, then Slime Rancher 2 comes much closer to a final product that benefits from years of fine-tuning \u2013 even in this early state. This is most immediately recognizable in its presentation, which has been improved substantially. Slimes have a ton of personality now, serving as irresistibly weird creatures to chase \u2013 that includes the new cotton slimes that bounce around and joyously eat all your vegetables, as well as returning crystal slimes that come off as mischievous bullies in this iteration who want nothing more than to break everything in their path. The areas are beautiful and diverse too (even if there are only three of them so far), and the UI, music, sound effects, and lighting make everything easier on the eyes and ears, to the point where it hardly even feels like an early access game on the surface. Really the only issues I ran into were occasional bugs, like the all-too-familiar falling through the floor and seeing under the world thing, but those were easy to resolve with a simple reboot and relatively rare. Jetpacking around the hub areas is more fun than ever. \u201c The movement mechanics also have some notable improvements, making jetpacking around the hub areas more fun than ever. Running around is really smooth and platforming from place to place is more precise (which is a good thing, because it plays a larger role now) even if the woefully tiny stamina meter that shares its energy with your jetpack is still a constant annoyance. And while there aren\u2019t many of them yet, each area is impressively large, has lots of verticality to explore, and even has a few puzzles to solve as you hunt for slimes in the wild. I particularly enjoyed the new lava area that can be found in the Ember Valley, which required more thoughtful platforming and offered more danger than past locations. It\u2019s a little disappointing that the main obstacle they throw at you remains unchanged from the first game though, as you\u2019ll still be overfeeding massive Gordo slimes to unlock new areas and shortcuts. This is certainly a fun little mechanic, but I\u2019ve seen it a lot already and there are few fresh challenges to complete alongside it. The main enemy of Slime Rancher, Tarr slimes also make a return, and thankfully they\u2019re more cruel and intimidating than ever before. Previously, this mob of overfed and corrupted slimes were a fairly uncommon and easily handled danger, but now they\u2019re all over the place, spread almost instantly, and can become a serious problem if they\u2019re let loose in your farm. That said, they still aren\u2019t very threatening to you personally as they don\u2019t do much damage and are easily killed by being thrown off a cliff or splashed with water \u2013 or, better yet, just avoided altogether. But since they infect everything around them, they pose a real threat to your precious slime resources and can absolutely defile the land you\u2019re trying to tame. I was happy to see a little bit more challenge added to what I think of as the video game equivalent of a spa day, even if it\u2019s only a minor increase."

It's a game as much about taking in its nicely handcrafted, open alien world, building cool stuff and decorating it as you go, as it is about farming and crafting. The beginning is a little slow though, even with the intended pace in mind. Your starting, no-upgrades mech feels a bit sluggish when it's not sprinting, and you can't sprint if you're over your inventory limit\u2026 and the starting inventory limit is pretty low, which kinda hurts the giant super-strong robot vibe for me. That, and the storage boxes are a pain to manage, since Lightyear Frontier lacks that now-quite-mandatory feature where crafting stations pull from nearby storage for you. Nonetheless, once I got a few upgrades and unlocked some larger storage I forgot all about those first slightly frustrating hours. It's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. \u201c Frankly, that\u2019s because it's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. The details in the mech's tools and equipment are delightful twists on the themes of giant robot stuff. I loved shattering rocks and trashing trees with the giant chainsaw-slash-stake-driver, which only gets stronger and more destructive as you get more upgrades. Trees are planted with a huge sapling cannon to plunge seeds into the earth, while crops are sown by a scattershot seed machine gun that later gets a lock-on function. There's also the two tread-based modes: One's a path-breaking modification that lets you satisfyingly roll out dirt or stone paths, which then actually make you travel faster, while the other is a plow that lets you place freeform planting spaces for your crops across the surface of the world. My favorites, though, were the two most dual-function tools. The first, a giant vacuum, lets you pull up weeds and mature crops with remarkable speed. The second, a water spraying cannon, is initially a fairly weak blast hose that later becomes a long-distance stream that can charge up spheres of water and hurl them as soil-moistening explosions. And when you run out of water? Just go vacuum up more. What's your favorite co-op crafting job? Upkeep: Farming, watering Progression: Crafting, building Supply: Gathering, mining Exploration: Scouting, fighting Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results Those two tools are also vital because they're used to clean up the world around you. Your satellite buddy PIP-3R (that's Piper) narrates as you explore, but the world you're on had some previous inhabitants that left behind a huge mess of ground pollution. That wells up in the form of gooey gunk piles and a breed of mutant weeds that not only kill off surrounding vegetation but spread on the wind \u2014 occasionally even threatening your own farm. It's a fun little twist on weeding to catch them out of the air before they choke out your crops. Cleaning up the world unlocks more regions to explore, like thicker forests, twisty mountain paths, and coastal plains. You\u2019ll get new resources from each one that are then used to build additional equipment and buildings, as well as unlock more mech upgrades \u2014 like a stronger hose to wash down bigger goo piles and clean up even more new regions. It'll also attract attention from neighbors who are full for character, like a traveling trader who visits for a few hours each day to buy your stuff. There's another character \u2014 a plant science enthusiast who needs regular deliveries of produce and supplies \u2014 but I wasn't able to interact with him due to a bug that developer Frame Break tells us is getting fixed in an upcoming patch. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier. \u201c As for those ancient inhabitants that left all the ruins and mess? Well, I'm not saying it was aliens, but\u2026 You can explore the old ruins around the map, all of which send you on a kind of prop hunt in old buildings or caves that unlock new alien-themed stuff to build. Cleaning up the world also gets you bits of lore about what the ruins might have been for and commentary from Piper. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier, and quite disappointing in relation to the rest of the experience \u2014 not because it's outright bad or anything, but because it's very short and very sparse right now. It took me about 15 hours to clean up the world and get to the rather abrupt, pretty unfulfilling end, which is quite literally a popup screen saying the campaign is over as of its Early Access launch. I can clearly see where this will be expanded and improved over time, but right now that ending comes when things are just getting going. A short or open-ended story isn't a sin in a game like Lightyear Frontier, it just has to be paced in such a way as to deliver a real arc or end that feels like it's feeding into the post-story activity of building a larger farm and unlocking all the decoratable stuff. After all, I \"finished\" in 15 hours but spent another five excitedly exploring the new areas I had just unlocked, getting more mech upgrades and making the new buildings and decorations I now had access to. Speaking of decorations, there are a lot of them, and I was happy to do all kinds of customizing. You can get different parts for your mech, and even mix-and-match them or paint them to create custom looks. You can also build all kinds of neat little doodads to place around, decorating the world with outposts and campsites. It's hard to feel too disappointed by a game where you can make a garden of odd rock sculptures and then decorate it with even odder alien rock-plants."

        "Content": "What is it? What happens to all those cartoony blocks of wood, stone, silver and gold you match and eliminate in match three style puzzle games? In the world of Puzzle Craft they\u2019re put to good use: becoming the resources you use to build and grow a town from a small village into a bustling city. Players begin in the farming minigame, drawing lines to connect and eliminate as many chickens, pigs, carrots and other foods as possible.  This food is then spent to take a spin in the mines,. The resource-matching puzzle minigame plays out in the same way, but with players collecting stone, iron and other critical building materials.  Did we like it? It\u2019s satisfying to finally collect enough stone or silver to finally upgrade city hall or build that granary you\u2019ve had your eye on.  But Puzzle Craft\u2019s true brilliance is that each new building and upgrade has a practical impact as well. Building the Ratcatcher\u2019s Hut reduces the frequency that the dastardly carrot-eaters & combo-breakers appear in the farming puzzle. The pig sty increases the amount of valuable pigs that show up, making them easier to collect. You\u2019re always one step away from another big upgrade. The puzzle minigame itself might be simple, but Puzzle Craft\u2019s upgrade system hides a lot of depth that's a joy to uncover. Players must always make strategic decisions on whether their limited resources should be spent on a new building, hiring a new worker or on a single-use power-up. Making the right decisions can pay off in a big way. For example, the piles of wood you collect are near-useless. But that wood can be turned into grass-eliminating rakes, leading to huge boosts in your farming minigame score. Smart play pays off! The town building and puzzling combine to create a fiendishly addictive gameplay loop that's almost impossible to put down. Once I constructed my Diamond Cutter's shop I might normally shut down a game, satisfied at reaching a cool milestone. But in Puzzle Craft I just want to hop in for another round to take advantage of my new diamond-grabbing abilities.  Should you buy it? Some users will be put off by Puzzle Craft\u2019s light Zynga-esque social game elements. Jumping into the farming minigame costs coins, and players only earn coins by checking in on the game every few hours or by buying more with real-world cash. Other bonuses also accumulate in realtime, to encourage gamers to come back on a daily rhythm. These bonuses don't feel hollow, like they might in a game like Farmville. I savor every chance I get to see bonus tools and items pop out of my town's buildings, since they're going to be put to use improving my next round's score. After my initial $0.99 purchase I never once felt pressured to put another cent into the game. Your money accumulates very quickly, and the other bonuses you receive every 4-8 hours feel like true bonuses, rather than tools and items that are essential to progress. I\u2019ve played more than 100 fun-filled rounds of Puzzle Craft (the game tells me I\u2019ve traced 717 real-world meters with my finger) for that initial $0.99 purchase price.",

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is about building a family as much as a farm, but both the farming and socializing fall short in comparison to modern farming sims. This could be a charming adventure with a literal lifetime of activities to do thanks to its aging process and speedy day-to-day gameplay. Developer Marvelous even added same-sex marriage and new bachelors to help spice up the dating pool. However, those additions don\u2019t do enough to cancel out the bland backdrops, forgettable characters, and a few quirks that make it feel more dated than it should. Your story, as so many of these do, starts with taking over your father\u2019s farm in Forgotten Valley \u2013 however, this adventure quickly becomes about more than just planting crops. A Wonderful Life makes it clear early on that your relationships with the local townsfolk are the goalposts that matter rather than how much cash you\u2019ve invested into your barn. Of course, improving your farming and relationships go hand in hand, but farming goals don\u2019t have a time limit. Meanwhile your playthrough will actually end abruptly if you don\u2019t manage to get married within the first year \u2013 a strange choice that forces you to interact with romantic interests rather than letting those connections come naturally.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask However, one of A Wonderful Life\u2019s highlights is its aging system, which encourages newlyweds to start raising a child into a functioning adult with their own hopes and dreams. The town, which will start to feel like its own character after a season or two, also changes in interesting ways as the years pass over six different \u201clife chapters.\u201d Townsfolk will age over time, new furniture and upgrades will become available, the dig site will expand, and other changes will slightly affect gameplay. That\u2019s assuming you can stay invested for that long, though; A Wonderful Life can last you 30 years of in-game time if you play until the end, so it appears to lean on the hope you will feel invested enough in raising your child to build your farm up over those years. Each day takes about 25 minutes to play if you stay up until late evening, and since there are four seasons with 10 days each, it takes about 15 to 20 hours to finish a single year. While I did enjoy my first full year, it didn\u2019t intrigue me enough to want to make it all the way into old age. Characters don't have interesting backstories to invest in. \u201c It\u2019d be more exciting to nurture relationships if the characters had interesting backstories to invest in, but they just don\u2019t. A Wonderful Life doesn\u2019t put enough detail into relatable inner conflicts or complicated pasts for me to connect with. The bachelors and bachelorettes here bond with you in short, uninteresting cutscenes that try way too hard to ship you together. Many of the conversations I had with potential love interests felt surface-level, enough that it was a drag for me to get to know them in that first year. Most of the dialogue feels like small talk that you would have with the cashier at a coffee shop rather than neighborly banter. I don\u2019t need another person to ask me about the weather or start explaining their life story unprompted. To its credit, the dialogue sometimes changes contextually depending on your location. The manager of the neighboring farm once explained why she was helping the inn owners with their crops when I spoke to her at their garden in the middle of town. A couple of villagers even commented on the milky soup they bought from my shop. One of the bachelors also told me that my crops tasted terrible after I gave him an orange as a gift (thanks, Matt). That\u2019s more than a lot of farm sim residents can manage, and it made them seem a little more aware of the world around them. Did you play the original Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life? Yes, back when it first came out! Yes, but much more recently than launch. No, but I've played other farming games. No, I haven't played any farming games. Answer See Results The townsfolk also mix up their dialogue through the seasons and growing affection levels, and A Wonderful Life\u2019s commitment to being a \u201cliving\u201d game helped carry me through its otherwise repetitive structure . This inspired me to investigate if any of the gifts I gave them would lead to an amusing conversation. Sometimes, you want the aloof farmhand to tell you all your crops taste terrible so that you can feel joy when he finally says one of them tastes good. Or maybe you want to play until at least autumn to witness the grouchy girl at the inn say she actually enjoys the weather for once. A Wonderful Life does a good job streamlining many of the tedious bits from the original game with item stacking, the ability to sell more than one item at a time to the peddler, and a more straightforward way to upgrade tools. Its updated graphics brighten and smooth the grittier texture of the original game into something that feels more cutesy, too, and it offers more customization options so that the protagonist feels more like you. You can choose from a variety of skin, hair, and eye colors, specify your gender, and even buy seasonal outfits that I enjoyed changing between to shake things up. Some things felt unintuitive as a fan of the genre. \u201c These quality of life changes make it easier to play than the original. However, it frequently pushes you to learn through trial and error and read Takakura\u2019s Notes, the text tutorials that teach you everything from how often you should water crops to where you can buy animals. Things that I took for granted in other farming games, like how much food cows need and where to sell items, are hidden in the pages of these otherwise easy-to-miss notes. It might\u2019ve been wiser to have them pop up during relevant moments of gameplay instead of relying on me finding them by chance. I stumbled through a few hiccups even after finding those notes, like not realizing that the soil was empty because of lingering green leaves left on the ground after harvest, or that my potatoes wouldn\u2019t grow fast enough to survive the spring in poorer-quality soil. Takakura\u2019s Notes, which are lengthy enough to cover most topics, didn\u2019t prepare me for that. A Wonderful Life does its best to weave these tidbits of information into random dialogues, but even then, you might mess a few things up because of preconceived notions of how farming sims work. That does at least mean it might be less of a hassle for people new to farming sims to understand because they\u2019ll have to learn from scratch, but these things felt unintuitive as a fan of the genre. I eventually hit my stride about a season or so in, when I\u2019d learned more about the crops and animals. An average day consists of watering crops, milking cows, collecting eggs, picking flowers off the ground, and generally finding the best way to monetize everything. Unfortunately, the cash creeps in slower than your average farming sim because of how the shipping box limits what you can sell. You can only sell items that can be produced on your farm like milk, eggs, and crops, even if they come from other sources. That means no selling flowers, fish, or failed dishes. You need to wait for Van, the traveling vendor, to sell the rest of your junk. You could also sell it yourself in the middle of town, but that requires standing in the middle of the street for hours at a time when you could be doing something more productive like fishing or digging up fossils from the archaeological site. Eventually I revised my strategy to match A Wonderful Life\u2019s gameplay. I hung onto every item I wanted to sell until Van came to town, so that I could get rid of everything in bulk for an immediate payout. I learned to only sell my items at my own stand if I saw a person serendipitously crossing the walkway just as I peeked at the street, so I didn\u2019t need to stand there waiting for hours until a person passed by. Still, these workarounds felt tedious because of how long it took to save money for farm upgrades. It took me nearly a full season (10 days) before I earned enough money to buy one of the fancy new cows. The simplicity suits it, but it does mean there\u2019s a lot less going on. \u201c That dragging progression is a shame, considering the speedier clock (by comparison, days in something like Rune Factory 5 can last over an hour) and the broad catalog of animals you have access to early on. It works in the context of A Wonderful Life\u2019s 30-year arc, but it would be much more rewarding to play if you could upgrade your farm more quickly. For what it\u2019s worth, A Wonderful Life\u2019s simplicity suits it. There isn\u2019t a complicated mining, crafting, or combat system to worry about leveling up alongside your marriage requirements. It feels manageable and relaxing to wrap up your days quickly without feeling like you\u2019re missing anything or are so overwhelmed that you can\u2019t initially focus on settling down with a partner in the first year. But that does also mean there\u2019s a lot less going on than someone who has only ever played a game like Stardew Valley might expect."

        "Content": "The original Final Fantasy XII was a great game that came out at the wrong time. Launching on the PlayStation 2 distressingly close to the release of the PlayStation 3 and Wii meant that it was overlooked and underplayed by many. Those who did stick with it, however, were rewarded with a superb RPG adventure, filled with beautiful visuals, an engrossing world, and a unique free-roaming approach to exploration and combat. Now Final Fantasy XII is back as The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, polished with a high-definition coat of paint and a host of minor \u2013 but mostly positive \u2013 changes, giving players both old and new a second chance to experience the world of Ivalice.  Final Fantasy XII\u2019s refreshingly down-to-earth story focuses on the struggles of characters caught up in a web of politics and war, rather than a stereotypical cataclysmic \u201csaving the universe\u201d sort of JRPG adventure. The focus on the characters and their small but important roles in a larger struggle makes the various twists, betrayals, and triumphs of the story feel more impactful. It\u2019s helped along by one of the best localizations ever, which makes reading reams of dialogue learning more about the world feel rewarding on its own. This is a game where I thoroughly enjoy talking to each and every NPC, which is especially impressive when you consider that a playthrough can range from 60 hours to over 100, depending on your pace.   While the story is linear, the world is semi-open and allows you to explore large portions of the map from the beginning with only a few restrictions. Wandering off the beaten path can yield rewards like treasure and high-grade loot, but it also offers the risk of wandering into the territory of high-level monsters who can easily eat your party for lunch. The rewards for exploration are manyfold: areas that look like dead ends can contain noteworthy treasures, high-level enemies might drop loot that opens up new items for sale in the bazaar, and secret bosses lurk in totally optional areas that you would otherwise completely pass by. FFXII cleverly alleviates the problem of CPU-controlled party members behaving badly. \u201c Combat takes place directly on the map and is an interesting variation on the real-time, menu-driven battles of previous Final Fantasy games. You only control one party member at a time \u2013 the other characters are all directed by the CPU. Thankfully, Final Fantasy XII cleverly alleviates the problem other RPGs have of CPU-controlled party members behaving badly through pre-programmable commands called \u201cgambits\u201d which let you direct characters on how to act when certain situations arise. For example, you can tell an ally to use healing items and spells when your characters are hurt or suffering status ailments, target high- or low-hp enemies, or use elemental skills when an enemy vulnerability is known. Set up your gambits well frees you up to spend your time focusing on more interesting things like positioning in order to maximize area-of-effect attacks, while still issuing extra commands to your comrades when necessary. \"] It forces you to give every character a distinct purpose in the party. \u201c All of that is virtually identical to the original version of Final Fantasy XII, but one of the biggest and most meaningful changes in The Zodiac Age is the complete revamp of the progression system that determines everything from the armor you can equip to the skills you can use. Called \u201cLicense Boards,\u201d these grids open up things like passive skills, magic spells, and weapon and armor equip abilities through spending points you earn. In the original version of FFXII, every character could unlock all of the potential skills available on their license board, which made different characters play very similarly over time. With the revamped License Boards of The Zodiac Age, characters instead pick two boards (from a pool of 12) that correspond to classes like Knight and Black Mage, each of which has a more limited and specialized skill grid. While this makes potential skill pools far more limited than the original version, it forces you to give every character a distinct purpose in the party, and that prompts you to be more thoughtful and creative with both assigning classes and spending license points. Another new addition is the Trial Mode, an optional challenge that puts you in a brutal rush of 100 consecutive battles, starting from the easiest sewer rats and ending in a fierce run of free-for-alls against the most notorious foes in Final Fantasy XII. While you can try it at any time, it\u2019s designed primarily as post-game content \u2013 you\u2019ll need an incredibly high-level party, some fast reactions, and a carefully selected array of gambits and skills in order to succeed. \"] Final Fantasy XII has also received quite the visual overhaul for The Zodiac Age. While it\u2019s more of a high-res texture remaster than a full-on HD remake, it still looks amazing, filled with breathtaking vistas and fantastic creatures -- a testament to how strong the original game\u2019s art design was. A gameplay speed-up function (either double or quadruple speed) also makes things like wandering through towns or farming loot in areas with easy-pickings low-level foes less of a chore. While most of the additions and enhancements are very good, there are also quite a few missed opportunities to improve various interface issues the original version had. For example, the speed-up function is nice, but it still feels like a chore to wander through a big city to get to a particular location at any speed. Why not add fast-travel in towns instead?  Other additions don\u2019t feel well implemented. For example, you can press L3 to get a full map overlay of the current area you\u2019re in \u2013 but there\u2019s still a chunk of screen real estate in the upper right being taken up by a redundant area minimap even when you turn this on. Also, while most of your funds are earned through looting items from monsters, you still have to manually sell these items one by one at the store, which is more time-consuming and tedious than it needs to be. Perhaps the most egregious oversight are the hunts: Finding the clients and areas where hunts take place is still a royal pain in the butt, as they aren\u2019t marked on your standard questing map even when you have acquired information on where things are located. It\u2019s understandable that some monsters should be trickier to hunt down than others, but if I\u2019m told it\u2019s lurking in a particular area, why shouldn\u2019t my map reflect that knowledge?"

The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It\u2019s a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for.

Darksiders 2\u2019s kitchen-sink approach to gameplay and mechanics mostly holds up well. \u201c Three years after its initial release, developer Vigil\u2019s dark, massive, Zelda-like is back on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition. This current-gen remaster takes all of the puzzles, exploration, and loot-crazy action of the original game, packs in a wealth of DLC, and improves the whole package while running at 1080p, making it the best version of the game. That said, it\u2019s not necessarily worth revisiting for those who\u2019ve already completed Death\u2019s journey.  Darksiders 2\u2019s kitchen-sink approach to gameplay and mechanics mostly holds up well. The combat is still very much inspired by God of War\u2019s light, heavy, and airborne attacks, and slashing my way through masses of creatures feels nice and responsive. The inclusion of all of the DLC is a nice bonus, even if most of it is just a handful of new weapons and armor to add to your pile of hundreds that you\u2019ll gather throughout the loot-heavy adventure.   Watch the above video to see Darksiders 2's Zelda influences.  Traversing across the colorful world on horseback and grabbing dozens of quests from a slew of fantasy tropes creates an effective, if not entirely inspired flow that makes the adventure feel like a single-player MMORPG. While the visual improvements don\u2019t change the fact that the story is pretty dumb and relies a bit too heavily on the teenage angst of Death and his brothers, the varied environments make exploration an enjoyable experience, especially when you get into any of the many fantastic dungeons. Dungeons unfold in interesting, satisfying ways. \u201c Yes, the dungeons are clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda\u2019s, but they unfold in interesting, satisfying ways. You solve smart puzzles that require paying attention to your surroundings, find keys through exploration, acquire a new weapon or tool that rewards you with a great sense of progression, then use that to ultimately slay a final boss. That being said, there\u2019s little here to make me want to take a second dip in the 30-hour adventure, so the Deathinitive Edition caters more to people who missed out on the game back in 2012.",

        "Content": "There's a special feeling that occurs when a game indicates that it knows what its players are going to want to do, and seems to gently guide you to play it just right. In the city-builder Banished, that moment occurred for me almost as soon as I loaded the tutorial, which is one of the best I've ever played. In both how it presented itself and how it taught me, Banished clearly indicated that it wanted me access and comprehend its systems. And then... then it let me encounter my first harsh winter where a third of my town died to starvation. First Banished teaches its systems, then it crushes you with them.  Banished uses a clean, minimalist, and customizable interface where by default, 95% of what appears on the screen is the city itself. You can (and probably should) add information windows and a mini-map, but even with that it's a far cry from other series like SimCity or Tropico whose interfaces and pop-ups can dominate the screen. The lack of external interruption makes it easy to turn on Banished and lose several hours to the passing of the seasons. A late autumn snow threatens the harvest.  Its difficulty doesn't come from struggling to figure out what's happening or how to understand it, nor from arbitrary events like time limits or invasions (although there are a few random disasters like fires and disease), but instead from the rhythms of play\u2014expanding too quickly to feed everyone, or running short of firewood in winter. It's difficult to overstate how refreshing it is to play a city-building strategy game whose challenge is natural, instead of imposed artificially. Unfortunately, Banished\u2019s reliance on intrinsic difficulty means that it can veer wildly between too difficult or too simple based on either player expertise or the random setup of each map. While most of my half-dozen cities were properly tough, the last new village I started proved ridiculously easy--and without its difficulty, Banished loses much of its drive. But let's focus on the moment-to-moment gameplay, and what makes it so worthwhile. First, Banished is simply pleasant to watch and listen to. It's set in a pre-industrial Europe-style world, but the graphics, architectural style, and constant, impressive weather effects make me think of it as nothing less than SkyrimCity. And oh, that weather\u2014if you're a fan, as I am, of seeing and hearing snow and rain in video games, then the snows and rains of Banished are entrancing. I'm not sure I've ever played a strategy game with such a good visual feel for the turning of the seasons (except perhaps Total War: Shogun 2). Meanwhile, the sound and music are either unobtrusive or charming; I particularly like the little \u201ctink tink tink\u201d sound that laborers make when gathering stone and iron. Chickens cross a stream on their own to get to a new pasture. Second, Banished's moment-to-moment gameplay managed to stay consistently interesting due to never reaching a point of equilibrium where I felt comfortable with where my town was at that moment. There was always something on the verge of collapse. It does this in a few ways. Population-wise, unlike any city-builder I've played, immigration is not the chief method of expansion. You can only grow by having children, which occurs when you build new houses so young families have space. But kids are useless\u2014they eat, but they don't work. Too many kids leads to too little food and famine. But if you build too few new houses, your population ages and shrinks. It\u2019s a constant balancing act.  Banished also uses physical space to great effect. If the distance between home and work is too great, citizens become inefficient workers. But food and supplies are more easily distributed from a central location, reminiscent of the Impressions city-building games like Caesar and Zeus, which are my favorites of the genre. Several of the most useful buildings for hunting, gathering, firewood, and medicinal herbs are only useful in forests, but housing and farming destroy those forests. Tradeoffs like this are common from every dimension of Banished, giving it the feel of an almost-solvable puzzle. Putting everything in the right place seems possible, making play satisfying, but there's always a little more that needs to be done, which is very motivating. Harvest time. This happened enough that even in my most apparently stable villages, two bad winters in a row could trigger a famine that would nearly spiraled out of control: my workers would die first, creating a higher children:laborer ratio, which would cause me to pull all my non-food workers away from their jobs, which would eventually lead to a tool shortage, which slowed down work everywhere, leading to more famines. A city-building game with intrinsic difficulty merely from its own rhythms of play is a remarkable achievement, aligning Banished with something like Dwarf Fortress, though nowhere near as punishing or inaccessible. Banished's secret in accomplishing all this difficulty without being overwhelming? There's no money; you just assign your workers jobs, and they go and do them. This fosters the entertaining concept of attempting to create an utopian anarchist commune in the woods, for one thing, but beyond that, it makes the gameplay much simpler to understand while allowing the mechanics to be more difficult. Most city-building games filter everything through money: we must use money to prioritize what we wants, then the AI-controlled citizens decide if the money motivates to do that. Removing that makes Banished simpler to understand. Moreover, most city-building strategy games use money almost exclusively as their means of creating difficulty. Going into debt is the surest sign of failure, while complicated projects have a monetary gate. By avoiding funneling all its difficulty through money, Banished can take each aspect of building a city\u2014food, tools, space, materials, health\u2014and make it a challenge individually. The aftermath of a fire in winter. However, the focus on the moment-to-moment development of the city comes at the cost of a strategic or story layer. Banished is purely in sandbox mode. Indeed, what little story there is is almost entirely contained in the game title: you control a handful of families banished into a wilderness, struggling to build a new home. That's all there is\u2014there's no goal beyond survival and a handful of achievements to work toward. The lack of a campaign or meta-game meant that it was hard for me to stay motivated to play once I had a good-sized, reasonably stable village. This is not to say that the challenge disappeared, or that Banished no longer held my attention when I actually played, but more that I didn't see much of a reason to load it up again instead of starting a new city or playing something else."

        "Content": "I\u2019ve been up until 5 a.m. for three nights in a row, trapped in a loop of fishing for eels, exploring the forest, and feeding my (hopefully) harmless dragon heaps of food in an effort to turn him blue. This is all, ostensibly, in the interest of running a caf\u00e9 and saving my mother. The details are hazy. But even when the controls get in the way and the repetition sets in, I\u2019m still enjoying my time as a lost boy. If it sounds a bit like a weird-world farming sim, that\u2019s because it is. Little Dragons Cafe is helmed by Yasuhiro Wada, the creator of Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, and Little King\u2019s Story. Like its addicting siblings, it\u2019s all about the simple but rewarding tasks of gathering ingredients, building relationships, and earning money. But Little Dragons Cafe is its own beast, with pleasing storybook graphics, a much slower pace, dozens of hours of gameplay, and much, much lower stakes. In fact, it may be the only game of its type where there\u2019s no money at all. Just better ingredients, baby.  Instead of forcing anxiety-inducing decisions each day, like deciding between wooing romantic partners or mining in caves, your job is to simply collect ingredients and improving the caf\u00e9\u2019s menu. There are no tools to upgrade or festivals to attend. Learning recipes, the crux of the progression system, is done through straightforward exploration of new areas or talking to the employees. To cook a new recipe you play a short but actually fairly difficult rhythm-based mini-game. Using the best ingredients\u2014and nailing the timing\u2014raises your bed-and-breakfast\u2019s reputation, and that means more guests \u2013 which is apparently good, for some unspecified reason. The story is nonsensical, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. \u201c The story is nonsensical, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it thanks to a dozen weird, unshakeable details. Take, for instance, the dragon\u2019s \u201cmanure\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a precious resource that speeds up crop production that\u2019s collected right from the dragon\u2019s bed\u2026 sometimes while they\u2019re still sleeping in it. Or the old wizard who brazenly appears in the house, tells the children their comatose mother is half dragon, then spends each day standing at the foot of her bed, leaving the unsupervised children to their own horrifying paternal conclusions. Despite the silly and slightly disturbing plot, everything else in Little Dragons Cafe feels designed to put you at ease. You don\u2019t need to painstakingly water crops or feed your dragon every hour, for example \u2013 there\u2019s not a hint of time pressure. Plus, unlike virtually every other farming sim, Little Dragons Cafe doesn\u2019t punish you for burning the candle at both ends. You can stay out until 4 a.m. and you\u2019ll still only sleep in an extra hour or so. But you shouldn\u2019t, and the reason is simple: it doesn\u2019t help you.  No matter how many ingredients you collect or \u201cSupreme\u201d dishes you cook, the plot progresses at its own pace. If you\u2019re trying to complete the story in record time, you\u2019d be better off going to bed as soon as you\u2019ve stocked up your kitchen and reached your story goals for the day, which has been early in my experience. When you get stuck, those goals can be helpfully checked in the menu. They range from the slightly obscure \u2013 \u201cCheck in on the caf\u00e9 after lunch\u201d \u2013 to the explicit: \u201cCollect recipe fragments by talking to Rosetta and the hunter in the forest.\u201d For the most part these hints aren\u2019t necessary, but they\u2019re nice to reference when you\u2019re stuck. Some of the tasks you\u2019ll repeat hundreds of times just don\u2019t feel quite right. \u201c As you progress, your dragon transforms. You can change his color by feeding him certain meals, and he\u2019ll grow several times throughout the story. The larger he becomes, the more he can help. Yes, he becomes a bit less cute, when he ages \u2014 but he learns to hunt, bust up large obstacles, and help you reach areas around the map that were previously inaccessible. Each action he performs chips away a small piece of his stamina bar, but it can easily be replenished by feeding him one of the dozens of meals you\u2019ve prepared. But even when the map grows to full size, exploring it is never as fun as it should be. That\u2019s because some of the tasks you\u2019ll repeat hundreds (or even thousands) of times just don\u2019t feel quite right. You often get stuck on ledges that appear as though they should be easily jumped over. Hunting with your dragon, especially, is a pain because you need to get close to the beasts, then press the right button when the prompt arises. Problem is, by the time you\u2019re close enough, most of the time those beasts have seen you\u2014and if the beasts see you, they\u2019ll tackle you, stealing one of your dishes. You can avoid virtually any repercussion by just not carrying meals when you hunt... but then you won\u2019t be able to replenish your dragon\u2019s stamina on the fly. Of course, after putting significant hours into exploring and gathering you\u2019ll have so many ingredients that you probably won\u2019t care if you lose a few."

        "Content": "Hyrule Warriors isn't a traditional Legend of Zelda-style adventure, but it manages to work well as a Zelda-themed power trip. This all-action spin-off ditches the traditional dungeons and puzzles in favor of big, Dynasty Warriors-style battles, but the layers of Zelda fanservice managed to keep my attention for its 10-hour adventure. Aside from its basic but entertainingly indulgent story that ties three Zelda games together with an interdimensional crossover, Hyrule Warriors is all about fighting. The process of killing your way through enemy armies is mostly simple and repetitive, but what keeps it from getting too boring too fast are devastating special attacks that launch enemies into the air. This was especially fun whenever a lot of enemies would appear on screen. It\u2019s genuinely satisfying to make them fly and watch the number of simultaneous KOs flash on screen. It should be noted that few enemies on these vast battlefields ever stood toe-to-toe with me for more than a few seconds. But as with the Dynasty Warriors games, that\u2019s the point: You play the role of a hero with the power to single-handedly turn the tide of a conflict between lesser soldiers. It genuinely feels great to be stronger than 80 percent of the enemies on screen, and to watch the battle change based on which skirmishes you choose to fight. Whether capturing enemy bases or fighting tougher mid-bosses, I always felt like there was something I needed to do or needed to slay, even if the actual act of slaying is pretty much the same time and time again. The other big thing Hyrule Warriors has going for it is a diverse playable roster of 13 familiar Zelda characters including Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, and more. Each  has unique weapons and abilities - a heavy-hitter like Ocarina of Time\u2019s Darunia swings a mighty hammer to crush foes on the field; Sheik, on the other hand, uses a mix of quick strikes and a harp with elemental properties. Unlocking and switching between characters keeps the action interesting a little longer. Some surprising depth materializes out of the crafting system, but you have to dig for it a little. By replaying stages and farming materials, I could build useful equipment to augment character combos, weapons, and special abilities as the in game Bazaar. Creating special badges makes a character more resilient. You can also synthesize cool new weapons at the Smithy and carry over handy traits that add strength or magic properties. It\u2019s handy that you can spend rupees to level up weaker characters, because I felt encouraged to experiment without needing to grind each one for experience. Boss monsters are the main area of Hyrule Warriors fan-service-fueled trip that doesn\u2019t translate well to the Dynasty Warriors framework. They do offer an impressive bit of scale, and in keeping with the Zelda series, each boss has an exploitable weakness. But these oversized foes feel like weak homages to their Zelda inspiration. In the Legend of Zelda series, a big part of the epic boss fight design is their smartly laid out maps, which require some situational awareness. The battle against King Dodongo in Ocarina of Time, for example, takes place in a closed-off chamber with a pool of lava in the center, forcing you to use a narrow dry path to avoid getting run over by the beast or fried by the lava. Dropped into the wide-open battlefields of Hyrule Warriors, Dodongo and the other bosses come across as generic damage sponges. Overall, Hyrule Warriors just isn\u2019t much of a challenge, and even turning up the difficulty doesn\u2019t do anything for it. On higher settings, the average mini-boss just inflicts more damage and requires double the hits to vanquish, but doesn\u2019t change up his attack pattern. It becomes a monotonous chore to finish one off. After I completed the campaign, I got a few more hours of entertainment out of the clever Adventure mode, which repurposes a detailed recreation of the original Legend of Zelda\u2019s map for a clever item hunt. Most of the secrets littered throughout this 8-bit map all tie to existing ones from the NES original game, so I had to reach back to my memories of the original game to find them (a handy compass will unveil secrets if you can\u2019t remember). Using items like bombs or candle flames unlocks a cool new prize, and claimed by engaging in a standard Hyrule Warriors battle on that tile. Since completing missions in either mode will unlock more secret weapons, characters, and styles of combat to enjoy, it gave me a good reason to stick with Hyrule Warriors a little longer. However,  the local-only multiplayer mode is a huge disappointment because of very noticeable performance problems. Extending a second player\u2019s perspective to the GamePad means the resolution takes an awful hit, creating jaggy visuals that would look at home on Wii. Even so, things intermittently slow down a lot when lots of enemies join the mix."

Exploration of a diverse array of planets, biomes, and subterranean nightmares is the highlight of the voyage, but the combat, scripted bosses, and rich backstory help this excellent evolution of the established Terraria formula shine nova bright. Starbound handles the now-traditional routine of mining, refining, and crafting as well as any of its peers, and even allows you to group up with friends. The early game is a bit slow paced, as your handheld matter manipulator takes a while to bust through tougher materials until you upgrade it, and even the weaker enemies can get the better of you before you\u2019ve found the right rare resources to craft some half-decent gear. What truly elevates this open-ended crafting sandbox above others like it, though, is the diversity. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Randomized locations, hidden ruins, resources, and quests round out these worlds.Each planet I visited had me breaking blocks, exploring caves, and hunting for resources to combine and craft into items, but each one is unique. There are over a dozen interesting planet types to discover, from temperate to jungle to roiling seas of magma, and procedural generation guarantees an endless supply of them to explore. Each also contains several different biomes, both above and below ground, so you can travel from one side of a forest moon to the other and see three or more types of arboreal environments. Below the surface, it\u2019s the same story. I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for some of the downright disturbing (in a good way!) buried biomes I came across, and I\u2019d rather not spoil them for you here other than to say to expect the unexpected. It's fully possible to land on a frozen world and drill down to a liquid ocean, beneath which is a temple made of bones, which in turn hides a steampunk mineshaft leading even deeper to a lava-filled mini dungeon. And that's just in one vertical slice of a single planet. Exciting, randomized locations, hidden ruins, new crafting resources, and quests round out these worlds and help them come alive. Other than gathering resources, the main way you interact with these places is by killing their inhabitants. The side-scrolling combat, whether you prefer a melee weapon or slightly more thematically appropriate firearms, is tactical, responsive, and at times intensely challenging. Diverse enemies and fighting styles allow experimentation and prevent battles from becoming stagnant and repetitive. Meanwhile each weapon type has a specific niche and encourages a different style of fighting, to the point that switching from a sniper rifle to a sword and shield made me feel like I was almost playing a different game. Starbound Official Screens 9 Images I especially loved the story-based chapter bosses. Each of them is very distinct from the next, and some of the later ones are a serious challenge straight from the old-school Mega Man playbook, ranging from massive, skeletal dragons to lightning-quick swordsmen with complex attack patterns to learn. The frantic, retro-hardcore difficulty left me craving more. It's easy for its risk-reward systems to catch you in a death spiral.Starbound did manage to frustrate me a few times, in that it\u2019s a bit too easy for its risk-reward systems to catch you in a death spiral. Dying in most areas means dropping all of your crafting materials, food, and consumables. If that happens to be in the depths of an ice world past several fathoms of respawning enemies, getting back to your stuff intact can be a huge problem. That in itself is fairly standard roguelike gameplay, but the hitch is that healing items become absolutely critical in the late game, and sometimes I found myself in a vicious cycle where multiple deaths depleted not just my supply, but my ability to acquire more of these necessary provisions by draining my bank account. Farming resources to recover from that was some of the least enjoyable time I spent with Starbound. label=A%20New%20Frontier The story itself isn\u2019t the most complex or mind-blowing, but the universe that developer Chucklefish built to tell it in is overflowing with character and detail. Each of the six sentient races has a unique culture, architectural style, and ongoing conflict that must be resolved in order to save the galaxy. From ferocious plant people struggling with a subculture of cannibalism to self-aware robots stuck in a humorously medieval mindset due to a glitch in their programming, there\u2019s plenty of it. Books and other documents hidden throughout the sprawling levels provide details on everything from political history to hunting rituals, and the inventive, scripted dungeons at the end of each chapter let you interact with these hinted-at elements up close and personal. A major highlight of the story quests was a full-on castle siege, in which my NPC crew and I had to defend a batty nobleman\u2019s destructible keep from waves of enemies armed with catapults. I also really enjoyed the chapter dungeon for the super-smart primate Apex species, in which I infiltrated an underground facility run by their Big Brother-esque government to open the way for friendly rebels fighting a real-time battle, which was visible on the surface above me. It's clear the level designers weren't afraid to push the boundaries of what a side-scrolling dungeon can be, and it paid off beautifully. Yet they weren\u2019t vain enough to force us into it, so all of that story is optional. There\u2019s nothing to stop you from going off and setting your own exploration or building goals in traditional Minecraft or Terraria fashion. If you just want to make an underwater Viking fortress on a remote planet with trophies of all the space sharks you've killed, you can be on your merry way. But if you choose to let the story guide you, it interweaves itself with the non-story-based progression paths in a way that made me feel like I didn\u2019t need to pick one or the other. In between chapter bosses, I was often prompted to travel to new worlds, contact a new race, discover new resources, and craft better equipment \u2013 all things I would have been doing anyway. By the end of the story quest chain \u2013 around 40 hours later, granted I spent a lot of that time doing non- story related things \u2013 I had a good grasp on what further adventures were available to me, and how best to prepare myself for them. The story supplements the core gameplay, rather than merely sitting on top of it. I've never felt quite so much stylistic freedom in a 2D crafting game before.If building is more your thing, there are hundreds of structural and decorative blocks that can be collected and crafted to create exactly the look you\u2019re going for. From the various alien styles you can deconstruct and rebuild to craftable statuary and scores of available materials available across countless planets, I've never felt quite so much stylistic freedom in a 2D crafting game before. Even something as simple as a two-room A-frame shelter can be built a thousand different ways, to say nothing of planet-spanning fortresses that take multiple players multiple days to assemble. Small, personal outposts can grow into full-blown colonies, as you purchase charters that allow NPCs to move into the makeshift neighborhoods you\u2019ve created. They\u2019ll even pay you rent for your trouble, and more elaborate and embellished settlements will attract higher-paying clients. This creates a compelling reward loop for what would otherwise just be a freeform decorating minigame."

        "Content": "4-8-15-16-23-42  If these numbers mean nothing to you, then little if anything in Ubisoft's Lost: Via Domus will make a damned bit of sense. Based on ABC's popular drama, the videogame version of Lost does nothing to embrace people who've never seen the show. Via Domus gives fans a view of first two seasons of the show through the eyes of a brand new character, Elliott. A previously unseen survivor of crashed Oceanic flight 815, Elliott finds himself suffering from amnesia -- and suffering through a weak adventure game to boot.  Lost: Via Domus is broken into seven chapters that play out like missing episodes of the TV series. Each chapter begins with \"previously on Lost\" clips, a hook followed by the classic Lost floating logo intro, and ends with a cliffhanger. It's a smart set-up and does indeed give the feeling of a Lost episode. The authenticity ends the first time you run into a character from the show. Ubisoft only managed to secure a few Lost actors to do VO -- and most have small roles in the game. The lead characters from Lost -- Sawyer, Locke, Kate and Jack -- are all voiced by sound-a-likes. The Locke \"sound-a-like\" plays him as  an old timey prospector and Sawyer may actually have been voiced by Huckleberry Hound. For a licensed game, the lack of star power is a major drawback.  But you're a Lost fan, right? So of course you will soldier on. You can perhaps convince yourself that one of the Island's mysterious powers is making people sound like they came out of a cartoon.  Via Domus is wisely set up as an adventure game. This makes perfect sense for a property like Lost, where exploration is more common than action. In each episode you'll talk to characters from the show, trudge through the jungle and live through one of Elliott's flashbacks.   The conversation system is smart with different categories to sort your options. You can ask quest-related questions, general questions, get information on items in your inventory or trade items with another character. The general questions are the kinds of things we often see in licensed games that give background information to people unfamiliar with the property. The funny thing about Via Domus is that the characters' dialogue matches that of the show. So when you ask Sawyer why he was on Flight 815, he tells you to mind your own beeswax. And if you try and get any background on Kate, she remains cryptic. It's a good laugh for fans of the show, but will be frustrating to the uninitiated.  The trading system works well, even though there's little need to trade for anything outside of torches or a lantern. You will find coconuts, bottles of water and even a few books on the beach and in the jungle which act as currency on the island. Each item has a unique value that can be used to \"buy\" items from certain castaways. The trick is that there's no such thing as change, so you will need to be smart about which items you trade so as to equal the exact value of the items you're receiving.  You will need to trade for torches or a lantern, because a few of the earliest quests have you exploring some dark caves. This is the survival horror portion of the game, apparently. When in a cave, you will need to use some light or else your heart begins to race and then the darkness somehow kills you. There are random spills of water and swarms of bats that knock out your light, but it's otherwise fairly easy to keep from being killed in the dark. Navigating the caves can be a little tricky as there are some dead ends and looping paths meant to disorient you. Some will hate this element, but it felt like classic adventuring to me, so I didn't mind it.  The more annoying exploration element is traversing through the jungle. Here it is easy to get disoriented, so you will need to use a series of flag markers to negotiate your way through the jungle. When you reach a marker, press the appropriate button and you will be pointed towards the next marker. Trouble is the black smoke is patrolling the jungle looking to kill trespassers. If you don't know what I mean by \"black smoke,\" again, this is not the game for you. When you hear the smoke nearing, you need to run into a thicket of trees and hide. But this changes your orientation, making it difficult to figure out which way you were originally heading.   The interesting twist is the six flashbacks that occur during the various episodes. Elliott is attempting to regain his memory, to figure out why a stranger from Flight 815 is trying to kill him. When a flashback starts, you must whip out your camera and attempt to capture a scene you initially see as a torn-up photograph. This requires proper framing of the subject and focusing the camera for a clear picture. Once the photo is captured, you can watch the full scene play out and then wander around Elliott's memory for the hell of it. It was a good idea to choose to make the flashbacks interactive, but there is almost nothing to Elliott's backstory. It's a one-note tale that shows him not just as a character in need of redemption, but as a despicable coward and perhaps the very worst of the survivors of Flight 815.  As with any decent adventure game, there are also puzzles in Via Domus. And by puzzles, I mean one type of puzzle redone a half-dozen times. In various areas you will come across broken fuse boxes. To fix the box, you need to insert any of three different fuse types to establish a current of electricity. There are multiple junctions on the circuit board each with its own green zone. Those green zones correspond to the level of electrical current and each of the three fuse types lowers the flow of current a certain amount. The challenge of this puzzle is creating paths of current that properly reduce the amount of electricity to get each junction into its proper green zone at the same time. There's no timer for this, so there really is no pressure to finish quickly. While it would have been nice to see a greater variety of puzzles (like two types of puzzles instead of one), the fuse box challenge is actually quite good.  It's not all about puzzles and talking to poorly voiced characters. Oh no, there is also action. There are two chase scenes that have you running along a path jumping over fallen logs and sliding under tree branches. Sound thrilling? Of course not. You also get to fire your gun twice, so there's that. The action elements of Lost are poorly implemented and add little drama to a game that already feels a little flat. While I wouldn't necessarily advocate adding more action sequences, there needs to be more of something. If not action, then more exploration options, more puzzles, deeper conversation trees and more story   Put away that gun, you won't be needing it. Via Domus is one big Easter egg for Lost fans. There are lots of little inside jokes that only true fans can appreciate. Be it the random dead polar bear, Sun's unexplained change from speaking only Korean to speaking fluent English or the Others' prison for Elliott. As a fan, I had quite a few \"ooh\" moments. This is a game for the fans, which only fans can appreciate. But at the same time -- in a strange bit of paradox -- this is a game that will disappoint almost every Lost fan. Not having the appropriate voice actors, failing to properly retell the story of the first two seasons, and throwing in a very lame subplot about the Hanso Corporation are only going to leave fans frowning.  That said, the very end of this short adventure (literally the last minute of the game) introduces a twist that raises some questions about the Island. For that reason alone, fans should rent (not buy) Lost: Via Domus. "

Though it moves slower than a plow ox at the beginning, by the end there was barely enough time in the day to enjoy running my farm, managing my shop, doing business with travelling merchants, and exploring the nearby safari.  Running a farm in Story of Season has a satisfyingly rhythmic feel to it. Picking vegetables in a garden and spinning homemade overalls out of sheep\u2019s wool feels cathartic, as does selling goods for a tidy profit. That sounds like something you do in every farming simulator of course, but Story of Seasons adds a few significant tweaks that differentiate it from its Harvest Moon brethren. She works hard for the money.  For example, instead of plucking turnips from the ground one by one, you can scoop up a whole batch with a quick tap of the A button. Fishing is easy, too: trout and salmon can be caught with a traditional rod, or by swimming in the local rivers. There\u2019s also a handy multiplayer option that allows friends to exchange gifts and help harvest each other\u2019s fields. But my favorite new feature is the special seeds that sprout into Nintendo-themed items, like a Super Mario 1-Up mushroom that makes produce spring up faster. It\u2019s a fun and clever mechanic that adds variety to the harvest, and speeds up progress.  Spending less time on repetitive farm chores during my 30-hour adventure meant more time to go off and explore the lovely countryside, which includes a cool safari area. There, you can bring farm animals to graze (yielding better animal products), mine for valuable ore, and best of all, keep a menagerie of exotic pets like monkeys and penguins. The land around your farm is fairly large too, which gives ample opportunity to look for unique types of bugs and flowers to collect.  The biggest and best new idea, though, is in Story of Seasons\u2019 use of economics and inventory management. In most farm sims I\u2019ve played, you make a profit just by tossing turnips into a crate and waiting for the money to pile up. Here, it\u2019s deeper and more involved than that: you have to ship items to travelling merchants, who dole out more money for specific things on specific days when demand is high.  Making sure I had the right items at the right time (like dairy products to serve the needs of customers coming from Silk Country, or seafood for the people of Wheat Country) involved a welcome bit of strategy. I was constantly checking my calendar to see who was coming into town, then stocking inventory accordingly so that I had whatever a merchant needed. Eventually I was able to open up my own little stall in the local trade depot and sell my own wares (which was great when merchants weren\u2019t around), but even then I kept up a steady stream of business with foreign shopkeepers, since doing so would attract better traders with better items for my farm.

Sprucing up public areas may sound dull, but it\u2019s surprisingly fun thanks to the design tools that let you arrange decorative items like park benches and flower beds to your liking.  I felt a sense of pride whenever the visitor count ticked up.  If there\u2019s one unique feature in Story of Seasons that misses, it\u2019s the farming competition. This idea requires you to compete with other farmers for use of public land, which is needed to more effectively grow crops like corn and spices, by shipping the most items in day. It\u2019s supposed to add another layer of strategy, but it feels like an obstacle more than anything else, since the best way to win is to stockpile goods and wait until the day of the competition to sell them. I hated having to do that, since it meant waiting longer before I received funds to upgrade my farm, and there wasn\u2019t much to do in the meantime except tap my foot.  Which brings me to the one other significant problem: the pacing. Like its Harvest Moon predecessors, Story of Seasons gives you very little to do in the beginning. Options are limited to a small handful of activities including fishing, planting, and bug collecting. Those are all decently fun things, but they started to get boring well before I could open up more activities to spread them out. It didn\u2019t help that there was only one merchant in town during the first farming season, which meant several in-game days went by without the ability to sell goods and buy more fun things to use on my farm (like a cheese factory).  Luckily, going into town is always an interesting experience. Oaktown\u2019s layout is comprehensive, with shops and houses divided into neat, accessible areas connected by flights of stairs. That means you don\u2019t have to waste time running through empty space just to chew the cud with one of the locals, all of whom are interesting. (I especially got a kick out of Elise, whose snobby attitude and high opinion of herself is pretty darn amusing.) Counting his chickens before they hatch.  Speaking of the locals, I really enjoy Story of Seasons\u2019 pool of eligible bachelors and bachelorettes, who felt slightly more diverse than in the Harvest Moon games. I especially liked the dashing restaurant manager Raegear, the charming Klaus, and the stunning novelist Iris, all of whom felt more age appropriate than the teens and tweens of Harvest Moon. Wooing them wasn\u2019t too difficult (all I needed to do was give gifts and converse with them a lot), but their personalities made it an entertaining way to spend my time while waiting for crops to grow and merchants to arrive."

        "Content": "Ether One is a game about the smell of perfume that brings back a memory, the heartbeat that never quite fades, and the happiness that still has to be locked away. Or, it's a game about finding ribbons in an empty town. Just from that, you can get a good idea of whether or not you're likely to click with it, though it certainly won't hurt if you count \u201cexploration games\u201d like Gone Home and Dear Esther as fond, if melancholy jaunts. While you may glimpse sci-fi elements in Ether One's trailers, it's absolutely the new member of that genre\u2019s family - a short but captivating adventure whose puzzles are optional but heart is not.  The premise for this one is that you're a Restorer, who uses a special chair to enter the mind of a dementia patient called Jean and cut the problem out at its source. Along for the ride is an advisor, Phyllis, who flicks constantly between sympathetic voice, stern professional, and graduate from the GLaDOS Academy Of Narration Science. One minute she's full of praise, like \"You've done such wonderful work.\" The next, she's talking sinister experiments and \"I will not let you project back to the real world until our goal is reached.\" Her presence adds a lot, especially early on, making the world feel slightly less lonely, even if she does go a bit over the top trying to make out that this is a thriller of some kind rather than\u2026 well, spoilers.  From the start, Ether One sets up a hauntingly cryptic atmosphere with no real hint of exactly where it's going, slowly opening up the watercolour town of Pinwheel for exploration, examination, and mystery. It's the kind of world that makes it clear that Things Have Happened, if not always what and to whom, but which quietly sits back and lets them roll out at their own pace. It lacks the sheer depth of poking and prodding that Gone Home offers, happy to use shortcuts like putting a lump of generic books onto a shelf, but then it also has more space to fill. What it does provide, though, is richly detailed and carefully layered. Pinwheel is a town with a real sense of place, and just as importantly, history, with plenty to discover about its inhabitants as well as the subject of your investigation. The fractured reality of madness kicks in early.  It's also not afraid to put faith in its visitors, with a story that is definitely fragmented and often confusingly told, but in a way that feels appropriate for the dementia plot at its core and the revelations that unfold. It's a story about putting together the pieces, and part of that is finding and picking them up in the first place. The ribbons are guideposts, the details are in the environmental design. It expects you to pay attention and be willing to try and keep up with it, and much of the time, to simply go with it and trust it'll all come together in time. That said, it also expects a few favours, not unlike Gone Home, such as not pointing out the weirdness of just how much everyone here leaves notes and letters around the place instead of talking. Even in a mental construct, there's a point where these absent people start feeling deeply antisocial.  While simply picking up ribbons is the only mandatory task for most of Ether One, further exploration is provided by optional environmental puzzles that unlock secrets, and aren't afraid to turn the difficulty to 'fiendish'. Here, Ether One can stumble. It's often not clear exactly what it wants you to do in these points, not helped by the fragmented nature of the story and its telling, and actually doing it means dealing with a very clunky inventory and notes system. Mostly, that seems to stem from trying to avoid immersion breaking elements like menus, which is a noble enough goal. The puzzles are about restoring projectors. They're optional though, and involve a lot of lateral thinking.  Ether One's fixes are clumsy though, forcing you to hold down the mouse button to identify objects and to use interdimensional travel where a basic inventory screen could have been. Instead of that old faithful standby which has served us well in many games and never asked for anything in return, you can only hold one item at once, with everything else handled in The Case - a TARDIS style hub minus the time travel bit, or Fable 3 menu minus the occasional infinite plunges into inescapable voids, that you can teleport to and from at any time. It has whiteboards for notes, shelves for inventory items and lots of intriguingly designed oddness that does add to the atmosphere. It soon becomes a chore though, even with quick transitions, both jumping back and forth and wandering around to check on something or trade items for a puzzle.  Puzzles do help nudge Ether One to the 'game' side of the ongoing, tedious 'what is a game' stakes. It has puzzles, ergo it is a game. Nice and easy. In spirit, though, it's far more geared towards the exploration side, and telling a main story that is... fitting. As is often the case, it's tricky to go into details without plunging straight into spoiler territory. What I can say though is that while early on the focus is on virtual reality-type chairs and glowing crystals to smash and fix the unfixable, the overall sweep puts far more focus on the personal side. Dementia also isn't simply treated as a handy word to justify lots of surreal level design and have crazy crap fly around the screen and be neatly solved in a handful of clicks. New rule: if you never see a human face in a science-related facility you're visiting, run!  Where the plot ultimately goes will either strike its intended chord or it won't, but the emotions behind it clearly come from the creators' hearts. That made all the difference for me, especially with it handling a subject like this one; an illness so devastating to many, yet so easy to trivialise. For me, the fact that it\u2019s possible to skip the puzzles and just focus on the story made it much more effective, the amount of rambling and poking and prodding largely diluting those. The human brain may be a mystery, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not Myst. "

        "Content": "Even if I am Setsuna hadn't been sold to the public as a salve for Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 fans pining for the golden age of the JRPG, its many similarities to those two classics would invite comparison. But instead of shamelessly aping those games, I Am Setsuna felt more like its own game the further I got into its deep magic and skills system, and the more I got to know its cast of intriguing characters. Some balance issues come dangerously close to trivializing its otherwise enjoyable combat, but it ultimately pulls through on the strength of its well-established tone and a well-told story. I Am Setsuna\u2019s greatest strength, by far, is its steadfast commitment to the somber tone it establishes right from the outset. Yes, there are brief moments of levity, but nothing that qualifies as an attempt at comic relief, and the journey is all the better for it. This is a tragic tale of a fractured world filled with people who vainly struggle against a rising tide of danger, and nearly every creative choice properly reflects this. The gorgeous, achingly sad all-piano soundtrack, the muted colors, and the relentless emptiness of the overworld all work in harmonious service to the themes of sacrifice, regret, and hope in the face of cyclical and unending conflict. The other edge of that sword is a sort of monotony that detracts ever so slightly from the overall sense of adventure. The overworld is just an endless expanse of snowy fields dotted with rickety old towns made up of a mere handful of homes, all of which look like they were furnished out of the same catalogue. And while the piano is no doubt a versatile instrument, that it is literally the only one employed does limit the music\u2019s range of expression a bit. It works for what I Am Setsuna is - this certainly isn\u2019t meant to be high fantasy - but I never felt a sense of anticipation of what might be waiting through the next cave entrance because I usually already knew. Doomed From The Start What I was looking forward to, though, was finding out more about my traveling companions, whose tales are at a glance familiar: You are part of a group of adventurers whose main purpose is to help one special individual, the titular Setsuna, complete her journey to a far-off place. But I Am Setsuna betrays this well-worn trope in a number of interesting ways, not the least of which is the fact (revealed in the very beginning) that you are escorting Setsuna to her sacrificial death. You aren\u2019t a bright-eyed young man looking for adventure, or even saving the world; you\u2019re a heartless mercenary who\u2019s escorting a young woman to her innevitable death. \u201c In this world humankind scrapes by despite monsters of all kinds constantly hunting and killing them, and the only way to keep that threat somewhat at bay is to send an 18-year-old off to die. You aren\u2019t a bright-eyed young man looking for adventure, or even saving the world; you\u2019re a heartless mercenary who\u2019s escorting a young woman to her death, just so what\u2019s left of humanity can continue to huddle semi-safely in in their little shacks for a few more years.This pervasive sense of inevitable loss, as well as the feeling that humanity\u2019s best days are already in the distant past, casts the actions and motivations of everyone involved in a unique light that keeps the story from feeling like the JRPGs it clearly borrows from. You will almost assuredly think you know these characters based on superficial similarities between them and characters from your favorite Final Fantasies of old, but none of this cast is what they seem. Don\u2019t expect massive, mind-bending twists, but each of them has a story to tell, and I Am Setsuna does a great job of setting them up, developing them, and letting them have their moments without bogging things down with heavy exposition or 30-minute-long cutscenes. It never feels overly dour or self-indulgent either, which is something of a feat given how heavy the themes are. Maybe it\u2019s because most of the denizens of I Am Setsuna\u2019s world have long since given up hope or struggle. Their resignation to their circumstances is part of what makes it such a heartbreaking tale, but it also lends a certain serenity to the proceedings. There is no melodrama here, just surrender to circumstance; as sad as that sounds, it makes every character\u2019s personal struggle and their resolve to see Setsuna to her end all the more poignant. A Bit Too Much Power Beneath its somber beauty are deep magic and skill systems which provide a wealth of options for party customization. Each character has their own distinct active skills, and a pool of passive skills can be assigned to anyone, but you have a limited number of ability slots to work with. Individual skills can be further altered with repeated use over time by a variety of bonus effects, and potential skill modifiers. I could end up with a provoke ability that heals me in addition to forcing monsters to attack me, or a fire spell that temporarily increases all of my stats. Add in the fact that characters don\u2019t generally fit the traditional tank/healer/dps model of modern RPGs, and that specific characters have combination attacks together, and you have a ton of permutations at your disposal. Beneath its somber beauty are deep magic and skill systems which provide a wealth of options for party customization. \u201c I Am Setsuna thankfully does a good job of rolling this stuff out slowly and in digestible bites. Its core might be ripped almost entirely from Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6, but all these other elements really set it apart, ramping up the complexity considerably. The same goes for the combat, which employs a third resource to manage on top of mana and health, other new wrinkles in the form of timed button presses, and randomly occurring events called SIngularities which temporarily alter a variety of properties such as base character stats, elemental damage, and many more. All these systems work in tandem to provide a constant stream of interesting decisions to make, to a far greater degree than in the games I Am Setsuna walks in the footsteps of. I had a great time figuring out new, crafty combinations of party members and abilities to annihilate groups of enemies with.

From an early point, I was able to identify skills that, with just a little tweaking, let me basically one-shot entire encounters. As long as I kept up with my gear (which is a disappointingly simplified series of straight-line upgrades) and kept making slight changes as needed, I was able to fly through fight after fight with just two or three different abilities. By sticking to these strategies, I blew through I Am Setsuna in around 20 hours, only dying once or twice on one particularly tough boss about two thirds of the way through the campaign. I kept waiting for my tactics to stop working so I\u2019d have to rethink things and try new approaches, but they never did; even in the final areas I felt like I was on nothing more than a routine farming run. I kept waiting for my tactics to stop working so I\u2019d have to rethink things and try new approaches, but they never did; even in the final areas I felt like I was on nothing more than a routine farming run. \u201c Instead of balancing those abilities out by reducing their power or increasing enemy resistance, I Am Setsuna puts a Band-Aid on the problem in the form of a unique system that changes item drops based on the types of attacks you use to defeat an enemy. For instance, kill a monster with with a fire spell and you\u2019ll receive one item; kill that same monster with lightning while they are under the effect of a debuff will net you something else entirely. This is meant to encourage build variety by incentivizing you to use other, less expedient tactics. Each monster has 12 different potential drops depending on how you slay them, and each of those drops is a vital component for unlocking new spells and abilities, so theoretically if you want to see all that your characters have to offer you need to experiment with different abilities. The turn-based battles are far more interesting when played with that in mind, forcing you to exhibit an understanding of I Am Setsuna\u2019s thoughtfully interlocking gameplay systems. Sadly, all of that depth is undermined by the fact that you can power through with the basics, and there\u2019s no way to pump up the difficulty either. Nintendo Switch Version - March 7, 2017 The only difference between the PS4 and Switch versions of I Am Setsuna is the frame rate. Despite having a visual style and level of fidelity usually associated with a PlayStation 2-era game, the Switch version runs at 30 fps, as opposed to the PS4 version\u2019s 60. Though it doesn\u2019t hamper the turn-based gameplay in any way, it is disappointing considering that the Switch\u2019s hardware should be more than up to the task."

Now your guard is having a nervous breakdown, and if he doesn\u2019t snap out of it the hostages are gonna run and dammit it\u2019s all gone to hell again. Here\u2019s the fascinating bit: Gods Will Be Watching isn\u2019t a blockbuster shooter. It packs all that action into a point-and-click adventure game. All of its chapters are life-or-death crisis points, where blood has or will be spilled and any slightly wrong choice could lead to total disaster. You click on the ground to move, on other characters to tell them what to do, and click on yourself to talk. Only tradition says that adventure games should be puzzle-heavy stories set in charming worlds, Gods Will Be Watching is a refreshing and challenging new direction for this type of game. Gods joins Telltale\u2019s recent much-acclaimed games, The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, in reframing adventures. But it works in an opposite fashion\u2014Telltale\u2019s games moved away from puzzles by focusing on dialogue and unique ethical choices, while Gods Will Be Watching focuses on resource and time management, judging random numbers, repeating tasks, and gathering information. And instead of the moral choices of a BioWare-style RPG, Gods uses a strategy game concept. Pay attention to everything and make the best (or the least terrible) choice available. Succeed or fail, learn and repeat. It\u2019s a novel feeling, while never veering from the form of an adventure game. Each scenario generally gives you the overall plot goals quickly, then details about the specific manner of escaping the room. And it is usually a room\u2014Gods isn\u2019t a game with much exploration\u2014which can give it a claustrophobic feeling that works well with the extreme tension of its scenarios. Then you\u2019re told exactly what your characters can do in that situation. In one, for example, you\u2019re trapped in a cave where only a robot companion can recharge the power to keep the lights on, while only one of the other humans can repair the robot, and only those two can charge a machine that prevents your characters from freezing, and so on. While these scenarios often sound complicated in initial description, they\u2019re pretty straightforward in practice. The chief problem with this form of adventure game is that the difficult can veer wildly. In that first hostage situation, I had to restart a dozen times or more, trying to find the balance between hostage management and hack acceleration to put me through. That\u2019s fine\u2014Gods makes it clear that it can be a very difficult game\u2014but then the next two sections are relatively easy, with restarts that are totally optional. (Although it does troll you a bit by moving the goalposts on puzzles\u2014sometimes to make them easier, but also annoyingly to make them harder.) There are six chapters in Gods, and each takes between 10 and 40 minutes or so, so it\u2019s theoretically a short game\u2026 unless that difficulty causes level restarts, which is pretty common. Gods Will Be Watching\u2019s story works in harmony with its tense scenarios. The main character is an elite special forces soldier/spy, whose infiltration of a terrorist/freedom fighter group and status as a double agent puts him in the heart of the kinds of tense conflicts that Gods is built around. The jagged pixel art both suggests early 1990s adventure games and creates an appropriately disorienting mood around the brutality of the universe. That brutality can be somewhat overwhelming, however. The division of Gods Will Be Watching into small chapters of singularly intense events means that it relies on science fiction cliches of grand evil empires and hyper-competent soldiers to make sense, while the personal story is overwhelmingly bleak and occasionally nasty, filled with things like torture, murder, and human experimentation."

It\u2019s a nice addition, but after spending some time with it I found I didn\u2019t enjoy actually having to figure out whole floor plans as much as I did messing with ones that were already there. The community is going to build some crazy stuff with it, though, so I look forward to leaving it alone and lazily admiring the Palace of Versailles as rebuilt in House Flipper 2 by a 47-year-old woman from Iowa. The community is going to build some crazy stuff with sandbox mode. \u201c I should also mention the new Assembly Mode, which brings back an element that\u2019s been removed from the main game in House Flipper 2. In House Flipper: Origins (or whatever we\u2019re calling the first one now) every time you had to install a shower or a sink you could look forward to a slowly animated process of screwing and unscrewing various components; now you can just whack those things into a room without even thinking about a screwdriver. I can imagine a building purist feeling cheated, but I won't miss having to deal with urinal plumbing systems unless I want to. If I ever do, that laborious process is still available \u2013 just tucked away in this mode where you have the chance to install raw plugs and get rewarded with store discounts. For me, House Flipper 2 absolutely nails the flow state that makes this type of sim game such an all-encompassing way to spend your gaming time. The dopamine hits come in little waves, you\u2019d have to be trying very hard to fail, and the stakes are so low that worms tease them about their height. You can decide to get really pissed that some dude is trying to lowball you on your latest flipping project at auction, but that\u2019s an issue between you and your therapist, not something House Flipper 2 does anything to inflict on you. After finishing the story quests in around ten hours or so - you can do it in less if you're not obsessed about getting mugs on shelves in meticulous formation - I\u2019m working my way through the properties I can flip at auction, and with plenty of houses to cover with pink shag rugs and yellow zebra wallpaper, this will be on my regular gaming rotation whenever I need a break from murdering aggressive alien life or trying to have sex with bears. It\u2019s not the most exciting game out there, but they don\u2019t all have to be."

        "Content": "There\u2019s a disappointing trend going on right now with the classic trio of farm life sims \u2013 Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and now Rune Factory all having a rough time making the jump from handheld to console. Last year Story of Seasons made the leap best , if imperfectly, while Harvest Moon\u2019s attempt around the same time was utterly mediocre. Rune Factory 5 has fallen somewhere in the middle, with the series\u2019 first dedicated Switch game largely clinging to the depth that has earned it praise in the past. Unfortunately, it can\u2019t manage to translate other elements like  \u201clooking nice\u201d or \u201crunning well\u201d in its move from Rune Factory 4 's top-down perspective to a 3D world, leaving it in a fun but frequently frustrating spot. Rune Factory 5\u2019s abrupt opening sees a young amnesiac hero dropped via portal just outside the backwater town of Rigbarth, where a community service-oriented organization called SEED takes them in as the newest ranger \u2013 basically a scout crossed with a monster cop. As a SEED ranger, the protagonist can tend a massive farm and grow tons of different crops, capture and raise a wide array of wild monsters for resources and combat assistance, run various errands for the villagers, or fight off monsters that threaten the town. Their community service quickly takes a cheesy if enjoyable turn into a winding mystery involving powerful creatures, more folks turning up with amnesia, dragons, and plenty more pleasantly extra anime protagonist fluff. Rune Factory 5 Screenshots 13 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The story itself is surprisingly meaty, kept fresh across numerous excursions into monster-infested wilds by a decent amount of variety in its biomes (including a prehistoric volcano, ice caverns, and a dope ghost town) and enemy types (ranging from cute little sheep-like dudes to heinous teleporting grim reaper guys). Just when I thought I'd explored everything there was to see, I'd be sent into another dungeon I didn't know existed, or back into an old dungeon to delve into an entirely new set of caves, always with enough updates to avoid being a reskin of the upper levels I had already moved on from. As usual for Rune Factory, you can befriend your neighbors and progress their individual storylines through conversations, cutscenes, and gifts \u2013 some of whom you can eventually marry and have a child with. The roster of 12 bachelors and bachelorettes in Rune Factory 5 is pleasingly varied with great art design and with plenty of variety in personality types, though almost all of the options are on the younger end of adulthood with the only more mature options being the lupine Murakumo and the succubus Ludmila. Every romanceable character has numerous story events you can unlock and participate in as your affections grow, and unlike other games with similar features Rune Factory 5 has helpful map icons to ensure you know exactly where to find them once they're available. Even the folks in town you can't marry are interesting enough, and worth taking the time to chat with and befriend. Even the folk you can't marry are worth taking the time to chat with and befriend. \u201c One way to befriend them is through the tasks board outside of SEED headquarters, where townspeople will offer rewards in return for various tasks being done. A sizable chunk of these jobs are glorified tutorials, steadily guiding you through Rune Factory 5\u2019s numerous farming, crafting, and combat intricacies and offering rewards for figuring them out. It\u2019s an imperfect way to teach you the basics, as the slow pacing of these quests meant I had often mastered a system well before it was introduced via sidequest, or wasn\u2019t shown a helpful system until much later on because I was stuck on an earlier task. But because Rune Factory 5 is so wonderfully open-ended and unconcerned with time constraints, these pacing blips didn\u2019t matter much in the long run. To Rune Factory\u2019s credit, you can either beeline your way through the main story and finish in about 35 hours, or take it at a slower pace alongside the rest of its activities and extend it out much, much longer. That said, one odd story quirk pushed me more toward the former approach where I would have preferred the latter. An event about one-third of the way into the story takes away a key power from the main character, one tied to everything from monster catching to raising one\u2019s rank within the SEED organization to collecting certain useful items. You don\u2019t get this power back until you\u2019ve completed about 5-10 more hours of dungeons and story events, though that time stretches even longer if you\u2019re busy farming, crafting, or hanging out with your neighbors instead of dashing your way through mainline quests. It\u2019s a weird choice that forced me to play Rune Factory 5 in a much more story-focused way than I would have otherwise, just so I could get back to filling all my empty barns with Woolys again. That story speedrun I went through was primarily disappointing because Rune Factory 5's farming, crafting, and relationship systems are so broad that I always had more I wanted to do outside of the main plot. As usual for Rune Factory, time in-game progresses through six-day weeks, four per season, with built-in time of day, weather, and seasons impacting how your crops grow, what your neighbors are doing, what events can occur, and more. Central to Rune Factory 5 is the farm, which you can clear of debris, till, sow, water, and harvest at your leisure. Crops grow fast and are not confined to seasons, so you can grow whatever, whenever, and will unlock new crops over time through certain sidequests. But while it\u2019s easy to grow crops at all, there's a surprising amount of depth to growing crops well . Factors like seasons, how much you're using the same patch of soil, how you're harvesting seeds, and so much more impact your crop yield and quality. Having the flexibility to ignore it all if you want or spend hours trying to get the most perfect green peppers you can grow makes the whole system spring with life. Closely tied to farming is Rune Factory 5\u2019s robust crafting system. In fact, crafting is at the heart of everything in Rune Factory 5 \u2013 it leads to stronger weapons and armor for dungeon crawls, better farming tools, higher quality meals cooked from farmed crops that you can sell or give to neighbors, and so much more. Rune Factory 5 does overdo it a little in the sheer chaos of how many unique crafting tables you need sitting around to make everything you want, and learning new recipes is unfortunately dependent on some level of luck, as you learn a few random recipes each time you consume a \u201crecipe bread\u201d item for a given trade. But as with farming, you\u2019re free to engage with crafting minimally if you just want to get the things you need for the specific trade you\u2019re interested in \u2013 you can acquire almost anything you would craft, admittedly with some more luck, by simply running around and hitting enemies for long enough, or as gifts from your neighbors. Or, you can dive in headfirst and try to master every single recipe. Cooking up a Storm I love cooking in video games, and while Rune Factory 5\u2019s crafting system required me to set up something like five different tables for all my different culinary endeavors, I had a great time chasing down new recipes and puzzling out how to make them. Like its other crafting systems, cooking in Rune Factory 5 consumes rune power, of which you have a limited amount each day (though you can restore or increase it through various methods). You can use a recipe to cook something for a small amount of rune power, or you can experiment with different ingredients and try to discover something on your own for a much larger amount. Even if it wasn\u2019t always advantageous to do so, I really enjoyed trying to learn the rules of Rune Factory 5\u2019s cooking so I could more effectively experiment. For instance, using the cutting board on most kinds of fish would result in a new sashimi recipe, and the blender with different fruits or veggies would net me some type of drink or smoothie. It\u2019s also a great moneymaker too \u2013 with a single daily egg and milk from two monsters in my barn, I could make a fancy omelet to sell or give away to someone I loved. Essentially, if I really wanted to, I could have played through the majority of Rune Factory 5 just as a chef and ignored 90% of everything else \u2013 and that\u2019s part of what makes it fun. One small detail that unexpectedly stands out is the writing in Rune Factory 5\u2019s item descriptions. Almost every item has a funny blurb explaining what it is and does, and almost all of these are not only helpful, but also entertaining \u2013 things like the Safety Lance\u2019s punny reference to the song \u201cSafety Dance\u201d in its description, or the blunt explanation that \u201cSpider\u2019s Thread\u201d apparently \u201cComes from a spider\u2019s butt.\u201d These clever lines were a little touch that frequently made me chuckle, and are especially impressive given the sheer volume of items I was able to find and craft. Alongside farming and crafting, the other central pillar of Rune Factory 5 is its combat, which has a surprisingly wide array of weapon options (from short swords to fists to magic staves), spells, and physical weapon skills to customize your loadout with. Like farming, Rune Factory 5\u2019s combat is something you can engage with a little or a lot depending on your interests \u2013 you can focus heavily on weapon types and upgrades via crafting, stats, and skills to truly hone your technique, or you can grind and button mash your way through everything on a lower difficulty and no one will blink at you for it. It\u2019s a great system on paper, but both combat and farming can be massively frustrating due to just how bad Rune Factory 5 feels to play. Simply put, Rune Factory 5 runs terribly on Switch. \u201c Simply put, Rune Factory 5 runs terribly on Switch. The controls are slippery and imprecise, an issue exacerbated further when playing docked, where significant input lag causes actions to take longer than you\u2019d expect. That often made me overshoot the plot of ground I was trying to water, the spot I wanted to place a piece of furniture, or the monster I was trying to whack with my sword. That technical jankiness is especially frustrating during combat, with input lag making it challenging to dodge enemy attacks, and the slippery controls making movement awkward and chaotic. Because Rune Factory 5 gives you so much freedom and so many options to grind against enemies and get better weapons, I was fortunately never stuck in a situation where bad controls made a fight impossible \u2013 even on hard mode. But they did make what could have been one of the main draws of Rune Factory significantly less fun. (Rune Factory 5 is also alarmingly sensitive to stick drift, something I experienced surprisingly frequently even when using the generally more resilient Pro Controller.) These issues are not limited to movement either, as Rune Factory 5 has aesthetic problems too. While not the first 3D Rune Factory game, the jump from top-down to third-person was a rocky one here, leaving Rune Factory 5 lacking in much of the charm and detail that the worlds of its 2D predecessors were praised for, including Rune Factory 4 Special on Switch. The character design remains stellar, especially their dialogue portraits and the animated introductions for bachelors and bachelorettes \u2013 but the world itself is full of flat textures and long stretches of bland, empty space. The town of Rigbarth and its surrounding countryside feel big and empty for no reason, with objects suddenly popping in regularly and frequent framerate issues whenever there are a few too many things on screen at once. And sure, when I play a sim like Rune Factory I can still enjoy it without stellar technical prowess or cutting edge graphics. But with a ten year gap between games, I was hoping Rune Factory 5 would try to be something a little more impressive than \u201cRune Factory 4, but clunkier.\u201d Which farming/life sim series is your favorite?

That\u2019s in full effect in Fallout 4\u2019s Nuka-World DLC, which is big on sights and surprises but light on meaningful decisions. Our arrival in Nuka-World is as abrupt and forced, quickly funneling you into a tough arena battle with a raider boss. I found it tough, anyway \u2013 I showed up with a level 30 character, which is the minimum level at which the Nuka-World radio signal appears on your Pip-Boy, so I struggled a bit to stay alive long enough to whittle him down in the straightforward process of disabling his shields and then whacking him with everything you\u2019ve got. Of course, if you were to roll in at level 80 or whatever, you\u2019ll likely swat him aside like a bug - such is the nature of Fallout\u2019s generally appreciated lack of level scaling. If you want to be challenged, don\u2019t bring a Fat Man to a gunfight. Simplistically, killing the old boss crowns you the new boss, even though the raider gangs you\u2019re now in charge of have no idea who you are or what you want. Like much of the story that happens to justify your actions here, it doesn\u2019t matter. I was never in one location long enough for it to become monotonous. \u201c Each of Nuka-World\u2019s five attractions feels like its own small DLC adventure, each lasting between one and three hours and revolving around removing the source of various threats that render them uninhabitable. The parks all visually distinct and dense with interesting things to find: from the Galactic Zone\u2019s Space Mountain-style ride and Battlebots homage to the Safari Adventure\u2019s Island of Dr. Moreau and Tarzan references, they\u2019re all great to explore. Some, such as the Western-themed Dry Gulch, are short and easy. Others, like Kiddie Kingdom, are large and hazardous with multiple dungeon locations to be explored. The fast pace of moving from one environment to another meant I was never in one location long enough for it to become monotonous. They also feel different because each park has its own distinct flavor of enemy types. A few of the inhabitants are brand new, but most are buffed-up creative reskins of existing enemies. Feral ghouls in clown makeup, flying ant swarms, deathclaws crossed with crocodiles, an army of especially nasty Nuka-branded robot variants, and some subterranean critters as well. They\u2019re often surprising in ways that Fallout 4 fights have never been, and sometimes they\u2019re extremely tough (again, I was level 30) but not insurmountable fights. And of course, there are also a lot of collection quests to drive more than 20 hours of exploration, combat, and looting. A tempting suit of high-end power armor in a display case entices you to find dozens of Star Cores that power Nuka-World\u2019s main computer system. The recipe behind Nuka Cola itself (a reference to Coca Cola\u2019s notoriously closely guarded formula) is unlockable by finding enough secrets. This park is densely packed with those rewards. It\u2019s less generous with new items. There\u2019s a smattering of new loot around Nuka-World, including the three raider gangs\u2019 gaudy armor types and various full-costume suits (like the sexy astronaut in the promo art) that can be found on mannequins, but the most interesting are some new grenade types (one, for instance, summons wild animals) that unlock after you\u2019ve cleared all the parks. Until then most of the useful new items are a ton of potent new Nuka Cola flavors you can craft at a mixing station, including varieties with huge health bonuses, stat boosts, anti-rad effects, and more. That makes picking up regular sodas feel more useful and valuable, though considering each bottle weighs a full pound there\u2019s a cost associated with carrying these as opposed to the rarer meds they substitute for. Nuka-World is much less developed as a roleplaying game and not nearly up to the level of Far Harbor. \u201c While exploration and combat is strong, Nuka-World is much less developed as a roleplaying game and not nearly up to the level of Far Harbor. I wish the concept of being awkwardly shoved into a leadership role and having to balance an uneasy peace between three raider gangs meant more, but as far as I can tell the choices are mostly meaningless. The biggest decision you\u2019ll make outside of whether to kill off the raiders and turn the park over to its oppressed merchants is which gang gets to run which area of the park after you\u2019ve secured them. To test the effects of sloppy management, I gave everything to the animalistic Pack gang, but suffered no consequences. One of the gangs eventually turned on me and forced a shootout, but it appears to be an inevitable event - the other raider leaders remarked the traitor had rebelled because I\u2019d given the other two gangs more than hers, despite two of the three getting nothing at all. Besides which, the choice of which gang or gangs you want to favor seems all but entirely cosmetic. There\u2019s no big philosophical conflict between them to make you want to pick one over the other - they\u2019re just three different flavors of violent psychopath. In hindsight, I wish I\u2019d gone with the Disciples or the Operators because the Pack\u2019s leader suffers from an annoying audio issue where dogs fighting near his throne drown out pretty much every word of his dialogue. I wasn\u2019t all that impressed by the new companion either. Gage is introduced as treacherous by nature, in that he helped you overthrow the previous boss and installed you in the spot, and there\u2019s much discussion of whether he\u2019d do the same to you if it suited him. But I wouldn\u2019t have known it for all of his boot-kissing and apparent lack of agenda. His generically gruff voice acting and backstory are fine but not terribly memorable. I will, however, always laugh when I think of how his eyepatch disappeared after changing his outfit a few times to reveal a fully functional eye (he's a fake!) and that time he got hit by a roller coaster car and was dragged a quarter mile down the track. You\u2019re sent back to the Commonwealth to do what a raider does: attack and subjugate settlements. \u201c With the park conquered, you\u2019re sent back to the Commonwealth to do what a raider does: attack and subjugate settlements. I was excited by this idea at first because it\u2019s great to have something else to do with settlements when you\u2019ve grown tired of simply building them up - or never wanted to in the first place. However, I immediately hit a roadblock in the dialogue-based menu system for choosing a target, because it\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re presented with a list of settlements that includes some you own and some you haven\u2019t discovered yet. Many targets were invalid, but the only way to know that is to try to pick them and wait a few seconds to be told to try again. That\u2019s especially weird because some entries on the list are grayed out - why not just gray out all the invalid ones, then? When I did find a few valid targets, the fights (or negotiations, threats, and bribery if you\u2019re trying to be the world\u2019s first pacifist raider) are an interesting novelty the first couple of times for the goofy antics that the AI gets up to when it fights itself, but limited if you\u2019ve ever set up your own battles with console commands. I do love how aggressive the raiders are once they\u2019ve set up shop \u2013 they\u2019ll take potshots at virtually anything that happens by, including Brotherhood Vertibirds. My rate of fiery wrecks has gone through the roof since taking over a settlement. Running a raider base involves a few unique mechanics because raiders hate farming. Instead, you have to subjugate other nearby settlements to send food and water your way, which is a thematically appropriate but ultimately no less repetitive spin on settlement development. You can also build a lot of raider-themed decorations that definitely make them look the part. It\u2019s just nice to have something else to do with settlements. \u201c Really, it\u2019s just nice to have something else to do with settlements, even if there\u2019s not a lot of depth to those systems. It does leave me wishing for a larger strategic layer for conquering the Commonwealth and fighting against other raider gangs in more than the one scripted battle that happens soon after you start. Once you\u2019re back in the Commonwealth there are a few reasons to return to the park: the gangs there will continually deliver free loot to pickup spots in each attraction, and every so often you can fight a beefy character who comes through the gauntlet to challenge you for leadership. It\u2019s a little unfortunate that the park is so quickly completely pacified, but at least those collectibles give some motivation to wander the grounds and see the sights after order is restored."

Feeling the pieces click together as a pile of plastic bricks becomes an epic creation is incredibly satisfying in a way that digital representations haven't always been able to recreate. So while most recent LEGO games have instead found success as silly action-platformers with licensed tie-ins, LEGO Bricktales goes in a completely different direction. It ditches the pop culture characters and co-op combat in favor of an original story with building-based puzzles. It\u2019s not quite the same as building LEGOs in real life, but it comes pretty close \u2014 even when you\u2019re fighting with the camera or obscure mission objectives. In LEGO Bricktales, you\u2019re a brick person tasked with helping your eccentric grandfather power up the theme park where he apparently resides before it gets shut down for good. Think Doc Brown from Back to the Future, but instead of a souped-up DeLorean, Grandpa\u2019s built a portal to transport you to faraway lands. Your mission: help out the locals across a handful of biomes and collect Happiness Crystals, which can be used as a power source for the theme park\u2019s attractions. Helping an archeologist explore a jungle temple, finding a long-lost pirate vessel, and curing a kingdom full of poisoned peasants are all in a day\u2019s work when you\u2019re trying to restore Grandpa\u2019s park to its former glory. LEGO Bricktales Gameplay Screenshots 19 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Each level of LEGO Bricktales is designed to look like a detailed diorama when zoomed out, which is reminiscent of the Captain Toad stages in Super Mario 3D World. Unlike many of the most popular LEGO games, there\u2019s no platforming or combat to be had here. Instead, LEGO Bricktales combines exploration and building puzzles for a more grounded approach \u2014 well, as grounded as jumping into a portal and emerging in ancient Egypt or medieval times while developing special abilities like generating electricity can be. These puzzles typically require building something out of LEGOs in order to proceed, whether it be a staircase, a lookout tower, or an amusement park attraction. Developer ClockStone is best known for the Bridge Constructor series, so it\u2019s not entirely surprising that many of LEGO Bricktales\u2019 puzzles also involve building bridges to get characters across chasms. You do this just as you would with physical LEGO sets: brick by brick. Building these LEGO creations can be wonderfully zen. \u201c Much like in real life, building these creations can be wonderfully zen. It\u2019s not an open sandbox; each of these puzzles has a limited number of bricks in various shapes and certain parameters that have to be met, such as height and width limitations. Physics and common sense apply here, so bridges should be reinforced and sturdy, paths should be clear, and anything that hovers in the air needs to be properly balanced. Before any creation can be completed, you\u2019ll have to give it a trial run to make sure it doesn\u2019t immediately fall apart under the weight of its test subjects (who happen to be adorable robots). These segments are LEGO Bricktales\u2019 greatest strength, but they can also be its greatest weakness. Putting together a challenging structure and then seeing it in the world and using it as intended is incredibly rewarding, but meeting the objectives is occasionally more frustrating than fun. It\u2019s not always clear why something you've built isn't working properly; at one point, I spent over an hour building and rebuilding a fire escape only to watch the test robots repeatedly plummet to the ground as my staircases fell apart. It could be that you're missing a single piece needed for reinforcement, or the whole structure might just be unsound. It would be easier to figure out if the camera controls were better, but I felt like I was fighting them for a better viewing angle throughout the entire process as is. What\u2019s your favorite way to build with LEGO? Follow the directions precisely Use the instructions as guidelines, but be creative No directions, pure chaos Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results The camera is easily my biggest point of annoyance with LEGO Bricktales, both in its building segments and while exploring. During the latter, you can\u2019t control the camera and move at the same time; in order to zoom out and get a bird\u2019s eye view of the area, you\u2019ll need to fully pause the action. This makes looking for hidden nooks and crannies feel like a chore sometimes, which isn\u2019t ideal when LEGO Bricktales encourages you to go off the beaten path to find collectibles. You thankfully have more control while building, but it can still be tricky to place pieces the way you want to, let alone get a proper view of what\u2019s causing issues. After you\u2019ve completed a building puzzle, you can go back and rebuild it in sandbox mode, which loosens the rules a bit and lets you use additional pieces in various colors and styles, but, there\u2019s no real incentive to do this. I wish I\u2019d seen more creativity and weirdness on display in these challenges the first time through, rather than the same slate of white, gray, and brown basic pieces over and over again. To be fair, the puzzles match the color scheme of the environment, so it\u2019s not out of place to find a raft held together with brown pieces representing slabs of wood when you\u2019re on the beach. Not every puzzle needs to be bursting with unconventional materials and unicorn rainbow aesthetics, but having some more variety would have gone a long way. All that said, it\u2019s easy to put these annoyances aside and just enjoy the adventure. Going back and visiting old areas after you've unlocked new abilities in the theme park allows you to find treasures that were previously inaccessible. It\u2019s similar to other LEGO games in the way it encourages exploration, and the collectible creatures \u2014 ladybugs, hermit crabs, rabbits, and so forth \u2014 are motivation enough to retread familiar ground. Even if you\u2019re not a completionist, the story takes around 12-15 hours to complete, with plenty of heart, humor, and cheeky references to keep things interesting. As an added bonus, LEGO Bricktales runs smoothly on Steam Deck, and going back and forth from my PC to my couch aided by cloud saves made the adventure even more enjoyable."

        "Content": "If you\u2019re a fan of classic samurai movies, there\u2019s a lot to love about Trek to Yomi. It\u2019s a katana-swiping side-scroller with a worthwhile story that does a magnificent job of distilling old school Japanese cinema into video game form. But while it never stopped blowing me away aesthetically, the things you\u2019re actually doing in that beautiful world are less impressive, with overly simplistic combat and exploration that only begins to scratch its surface. Even so, Trek to Yomi\u2019s stylish presentation makes up for many of its gameplay shortcomings, making this a memorable samurai tale I\u2019m glad I played. Trek to Yomi\u2019s dedication to black and white samurai movies from the 20th century is apparent in literally every moment of it, from the look of its boot-up logos and main menu all the way to the closing credits. That includes everything from the artificial sparkle dotting the screen that makes it look like it\u2019s playing from an old film reel, to the pacing and line delivery during cutscenes, to the references to historically accurate traditions and religious practices that play a central role in the story. It\u2019s actually hard to overstate just how great it feels to move about in such a meticulously detailed adaptation of a film style I\u2019ve always adored, and that movie magic is the best thing Trek to Yomi has to offer without a doubt.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The story itself is your standard revenge quest featuring a stoic protagonist struggling to choose between his duty and his personal desires, complete with the good ol\u2019 traumatic childhood massacre serving as its first chapter. It\u2019s a cliche, to be sure, and if you\u2019ve watched almost any vintage samurai movie then you\u2019ll be able to see a lot of its events coming from a mile away. But with all the other ways Trek to Yomi pays homage to the classics that inspired it, an overly conventional story doesn\u2019t end up being such a bad thing. Sometimes tropes become tropes for a good reason, and this familiar tale was like stepping into a warm bath filled with my favorite, samurai-scented candles. It isn\u2019t entirely without its own twists and turns either, and on at least one occasion it did something I hadn\u2019t anticipated \u2013 moments that went a long way toward redeeming the otherwise predictable plot. Combat is never bad, it\u2019s just extremely simplistic. \u201c You\u2019ll spend most of this adventure ronin around and slicing your way through beautiful backdrops with a combat system that\u2019s satisfying despite not having much to it. You\u2019ve got light attacks, heavy attacks, a parry, and a few ranged weapons thrown in for good measure, but that\u2019s about as deep as Trek to Yomi ever goes. Every now and again you\u2019ll unlock a new attack combo or meet a new enemy type that requires you to mix up your strategy ever so slightly, but after less than an hour I had mastered most of the skills I needed to blow through armies of bandits and spectral samurai with unbridled ease. This was especially true once I unlocked the ability to easily stun enemies and finish them off with a bloody animation that also heals you, which you can use to bail yourself out of nearly every encounter the campaign throws at you. It\u2019s not that combat is ever bad, it\u2019s just extremely simplistic and doesn\u2019t evolve enough as you progress to keep things feeling fresh. It\u2019s also very familiar to many other 2D action games, with no real hook or new idea to set itself apart from anything I haven\u2019t already seen elsewhere. Most of the time, I found myself just enjoying the awesome sights and sounds while I barrelled through every enemy in my way (even on the hardest difficulty, mind you). It\u2019s a good thing that the whole adventure only lasts six hours, because combat gets old in less than half that time, so at least it didn\u2019t have much chance to overstay its welcome in a way that got frustrating. Boss fights are an exception to the breezy combat though, as they usually introduce an enemy that can\u2019t simply be decapitated in an instant. These spongey champions must be studied so you can devise a strategy for surviving their attacks and carefully counter them. Bosses accounted for the vast majority of my deaths throughout my playthroughs, since they\u2019re one of the only parts that forced me to mix up my strategies. Even when I was getting slapped around helplessly, it was a blast figuring out how to best these dastardly warriors, but they\u2019re so few and far between that they just made me wish more of the combat presented a similar challenge. Trek to Yomi also dabbles in some light exploration and even a side quest or puzzle now and again, though it\u2019s all extremely shallow stuff. Exploration usually amounts to a few samey optional rooms with a hidden collectible or an alternate path to get wherever you\u2019re headed \u2013 sometimes you\u2019ll even find a way to avoid a combat sequence altogether by triggering a neat environmental kill, such as dropping logs on some fools like a vengeful Ewok. It\u2019s just too bad these ideas weren\u2019t taken a little further as it\u2019s currently all incredibly straightforward and opportunities for environmental kills almost never come up. Similarly, side quests usually amount to an optional area where you can slay a few extra baddies and grab some easy loot from a grateful survivor, while puzzles are little more than mind-numbingly easy chores like pushing an object or matching some symbols. As a result, these diversions all just feel like filler. How do you feel about black and white games? I like the style! I don't like the style!

        "Content": "I didn\u2019t always love my time with Another Code: Recollection, but I love that it exists. Nintendo is generally conservative with its remakes, updating the graphics and controls while usually leaving gameplay and story largely unchanged. That\u2019s not the case here, though, as developer Arc System Works took a huge swing with this dual remake, completely modernizing a pair of extremely niche puzzle adventure games with revamped exploration, a new third-person perspective, and a reworked script with decent voice acting. The developers clearly care about Another Code, and it\u2019s awesome to see a huge publisher bring back a small series like this. But even with all of its improvements, Another Code: Recollection falls short of greatness due to lackluster puzzle design and a predictable story that leans too heavily on convenient amnesia tropes. Another Code: Recollection is a full-blown remake of the 2005 DS game Trace Memory (now known in North America by its Japanese and European name, Another Code: Two Memories), and its Wii sequel, Another Code R: Journey Into Lost Memories, which hasn\u2019t seen a North American release until now. This remake smartly treats these games as two halves of the same story, both following the endearing teenager Ashley Mizuki Robins as she works to uncover forgotten memories from her childhood. Another Code: Recollection Screenshots 6 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Recollection tosses away the outdated top-down gameplay of the DS original and the strange point-and-click-sidescrolling hybrid of its Wii sequel, replacing both with a modern third-person perspective and fully explorable 3D areas. Think Life Is Strange but for a younger audience: You\u2019ll listen to Ashley\u2019s entertaining inner monologue as you walk around examining objects and locations, talking to characters along the way to learn more about the central mystery and advance the story. It even has some supernatural leanings like Life Is Strange, but its themes are aimed more toward young teenagers compared to its modern adventure game contemporaries. I finished Another Code: Recollection\u2019s fairly basic story in just over 13 hours, and Ashley is the key element that really makes it work. She\u2019s extremely likable and relatable from start to finish, as she struggles to navigate complex relationships with her family while also dealing with classic teenage clich\u00e9s like dreams of playing in a rock band. But she also expresses emotional maturity and compassion beyond her years with a genuine desire to take care of those around her. I rooted for her throughout the story, and I really hope we see her in a brand new adventure in the future. Ashley is the key element that really makes it work. \u201c While Ashley soars, much of the overall mystery around her falls flat. There are only a couple meaningful characters in Two Memories\u2019 story, leading to a very predictable outcome that\u2019s heavily foreshadowed the whole way through. Journey Into Lost Memories somewhat avoids this issue thanks to a much larger cast of characters \u2014 many of whom have enjoyable side stories that directly weave into the overall plot \u2014 but both halves still rely too heavily on tired amnesia tropes. Most revelations take place when Ashley or another character simply happens to remember something at a convenient time, usually triggered upon entering a new location. Flashbacks occur constantly, and by the end I was exhausted by this haphazard method of storytelling, especially when the twists it\u2019s building to were often unsurprising. The reworked ending of Journey Into Lost Memories is at least a highlight, giving Ashley\u2019s story a stronger, warmer, more emotionally resonant sendoff, but the overall tale seems better suited for a newer audience that hasn\u2019t experienced the twists and turns of every Ace Attorney, Professor Layton, and Life Is Strange like me.

Answer See Results Where Another Code: Recollection really falls short, however, is in its puzzle design. The puzzles have been completely reworked for this remake, and I was hoping for some solid brainteasers that made use of the atmospheric environments in interesting ways. But unfortunately, puzzles feel like a bit of an afterthought here. They come in a handful of varieties, but none of them are particularly exciting. There are scavenger hunts where I had to search around an area for some item I needed to progress, a few puzzles where I had to take a photo and bring it to the right location, and a lot of quick time events where you follow button prompts that appear on Ashley\u2019s Switch-shaped gadget. There are also a couple of motion control puzzles where the gyro controls didn\u2019t work as well as I would\u2019ve liked them to, but thankfully those are few and far between. Puzzles feel more like fetch quests or checklists than actual challenges, which was disappointing, but they are at least all short enough that I was never stuck on their monotony for long. What makes the underwhelming puzzles even more of a missed opportunity is the fantastic new built-in hint system. You can turn hints on or off at any time in the settings, which is great for folks who just want to bypass the puzzles completely. There are three steps to the hint system: a generic hint, a detailed hint, and finally the puzzle solution. I could choose which of these three hints I wanted to see, giving me the exact amount of help I wanted. There\u2019s also an optional navigation tool that displays an arrow telling you exactly where to go next. But such a great hint system feels wasted when the puzzles are so basic.

Two Memories\u2019 mysterious mansion is begging to be explored, and Journey Into Lost Memories\u2019 Lake Juliet instantly took me back to summer camp as a kid. I was genuinely sad to say goodbye to that place and those characters when the journey came to an end, as it perfectly captured the feeling of a chapter of childhood coming to a close. Recollection is also lifted somewhat by its presentation. Conversations are engaging thanks to their unique comic book panel style, most scenes are well voice acted with your choice of English or Japanese dubs, and the piano-filled soundtrack is easy on the ears. Some environments could benefit from a bit more detail, but the cutscenes that play during important story moments almost always look very nice. The new art style also captures the tone of the characters and story very well, and it was exciting to see these long overlooked games remade with such a high level of care."

Echoes of the Eye weaves one more thread worth pulling into the already complex tapestry of Outer Wilds, handily recapturing its charming, woodsy-sci-fi aesthetic and intricate time-loop puzzle solving, but this time with a creepier tone and a few sections that fully shift genres from adventure to horror game. That\u2019s not exactly what I ended up wanting from more Outer Wilds, and its siloed nature does make it a little more linear to explore, but Echoes of the Eye is still a great reason to revisit this ever-exploding star. Before I dive in, a quick word about spoilers : I\u2019m not going to get into specific plot points or puzzles solutions here, but I will discuss some of the new areas and mechanics. Anyone who has played the base game knows that much of the magic of Outer Wilds can come from the surprise of stumbling upon a thrilling discovery or witnessing one of its timed events from just the right spot. Echoes of the Eye is no exception, and I am going to preserve that surprise as much as possible, but those looking to go in entirely fresh should be warned that some of it will be mentioned by necessity. What We Said About Outer Wilds \"Outer Wilds\u2019 tricky exploration and puzzle solving is definitely an acquired taste. Its very specific brand of active storytelling differs wildly from highly guided open-worlds that many of us think of when we talk about non-linear gameplay. Though it can be confounding at times when events don\u2019t unfold in precisely the right way, the feeling of discovering something new about the story, or following a couple of facts to something totally unexpected on a faraway planet far outweighs those hiccups.\" - Mike Epstein, May 30, 2019 Score: 8.4 Read the full Outer Wilds review .

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Echoes of the Eye cleverly integrates its new mysteries by pretending they\u2019ve been there all along, hiding in the shadows. A new exhibit in the museum on Timber Hearth will point you toward a nearby research station monitoring a photo-taking satellite, and following that simple but exciting lead will eventually land you in a brand-new area with just as much to do as any of the base game\u2019s planets. This setup does mean that Echoes of the Eye won\u2019t have you bouncing around the solar system trying to piece together distant clues, which does make its discoveries a little more straightforward to unravel, but there are still plenty of intertwining secrets to find in this area alone. The bulk of this side adventure is basically a haunted river-rafting trip (which absolutely rules), with many of its puzzles and new mechanics built around using light. That includes the rafts you\u2019ll be riding between locations, which have orbs you can shine your flashlight on to float in a specific direction, as well as locked doors that open when illuminated. It\u2019s a neat little twist that sets how you navigate this area apart from the others, but it also maintains that same sense of wonder as things change in surprising ways at set times during each loop. The focus on light ties perfectly into this DLC's spookier vibe. \u201c The focus on light is also a clever choice because it ties perfectly into Echoes of the Eye\u2019s spookier vibe, often forcing you to wander through the dark and occasionally making light a luxury you desperately wish you could afford. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, this new area is essentially split in two: one half is much closer to the physics-bending, awe-inspiring planet exploration of the original game, while the other occasionally warps Outer Wilds into a proper horror game. I\u2019m talking a \u201cstumbling around in the dark trying to figure out how to progress while monsters hunt you\u201d kind of horror game \u2013 and it sure does play that metaphorical screeching violin well. Outer Wilds has always had some creepier sections and the looming threat of death, but this tangible mechanical shift (while well implemented) isn\u2019t one I was expecting, and ultimately wasn\u2019t something I was too interested in compared to my previous planet hopping. I will freely admit that I am not generally into horror games overall, and those who are will almost certainly enjoy these sections more than I did, but that\u2019s sort of the problem; these bits are so unlike the rest of Outer Wilds that they almost feel like an entirely different game \u2013 one that\u2019s fun but far less unique, and pretty much just had me wishing I was playing more of its usual style instead. Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye Screenshots 5 Images The horror sections are unavoidable, but thankfully not a huge part of the roughly seven hours Echoes of the Eye\u2019s surprisingly hefty expansion took me to complete. (There is also a \u201cReduced Frights\u201d menu option that makes these sequences a little less intense, which is a small but appreciated inclusion for those who actively dislike horror but love Outer Wilds, although not one that changes enough to truly solve that particular problem.) And genre be damned, the story told throughout this DLC is still an enthralling one. The self-contained structure and more linear layout of its locations does mean the pieces of that story are easier to assemble than the history of the base game\u2019s Nomai, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not fun to uncover all the same."

Its story is powerful, its freedom is liberating, and its world is one of the most beautiful I\u2019ve ever wandered around. Here\u2019s to more games not holding your hand.\"   Make sure to read that review, because nearly a year later, my thoughts on this atmospheric adventure game still stand. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played when I reviewed it on PC back in 2014, and now that it\u2019s on PlayStation 4, I can give it the same high praise on this system. The autumnal foliage looks gorgeous, the lighting helps create the beautiful but unsettling atmosphere, and gazing out onto the scenic vistas adds a great sense of place the whole setting.  In short, Ethan Carter is a fantastic first-person exploration game that focuses on tone, freedom, and environmental storytelling in lieu of combat. You play a supernaturally powered detective on the trail of the titular missing boy in rural Wisconsin, and must piece together memory fragments to solve some great puzzles. These smart challenges reward you with bits of backstory, and the actual act of solving them fits in with the eerie Lovecraftian tone created by its beautiful environments.   Check out our original video review for the PC version of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter above. Aside from maintaining the same incredible visuals and great storytelling, Ethan Carter doesn\u2019t require twitch reflexes, so the move from mouse and keyboard to the DualShock 4 doesn\u2019t detract from the adventure at all.",
