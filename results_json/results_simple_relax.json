        "Content": "Some games hide mystery in their titles, practically begging for every narrative thread to be pulled on to discover the secrets behind those words. PowerWash Simulator is not like this. Its direct name reveals that it is exactly what you think it is: the chance to live out your fantasy(?) as a water gun for hire, moving from job to job until all the dirt is blasted into oblivion. There's not a great deal of variety in such a career, and monotony can sink in, but a fundamentally simple yet satisfying style of gameplay provides a great way to chill out across numerous generously sized levels. Yes, it is just simulating the usually mundane act of hosing down your patio once a year, but PowerWash Simulator elevates itself above what could so easily become tedium by subtly gamifying the chore and shoving the most annoying parts under the rug. Anyway, let's try not to get too philosophical about it: Here's my review, in which I analyse a game about washing a 30-foot high shoe. There\u2019s something therapeutic about PowerWash Simulator. Maybe it's because, at the time of writing, I'm sweltering in 39 \u00b0C (102\u00b0F) weather and incapable of moving without sweat clouding my vision, but the sheer amount of water being blasted onto the screen is borderline intoxicating. It's like a form of visual white noise, and I've lost hours on end to this meditative sim about nothing more than taking your time to clean the hell out of whatever is put in front of you. It removes all the irritations of real-life power washing - lugging a bulky machine around, tripping over extension cables etc. - focusing instead of the act of sending water screaming into a wall. The complete lack of music and voice acting only adds to the calm, with only the sound of water breaking the silence \u2013 aside from the 'ding' noise that sounds each time an object is fully clean which adds a real Pavlovian edge to proceedings. PowerWash Simulator Screens (Xbox version) 7 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Each job starts the same way: a scene resembling the aftermath of a Splatoon round where the brown team won faces you, and your mission is to clean the mess and return it to its original spotless state. If you're feeling a bit obtuse you could even call it a first-person shooter \u2013 if the aliens or army men were replaced with inanimate plastic flower pots and delicate wooden trellises, that is. During the surprisingly lengthy career mode of more than 20 hours you\u2019re faced with building your small business up as you take request after request, cleaning up buildings and vehicles before reinvesting your earnings into better power washers and their accompanying attachments and soaps. You repeat the same routine no matter the job at hand, equipping the widest angle of the five available nozzle types to blast away large swathes of dirt on bigger surfaces before dialling in a more aggressive, narrow nozzle to deal with the finer details. A more concentrated burst of water is needed to get rid of those extra-stubborn materials \u2013 lichen, moss, rust \u2013 you know the stuff. You do have to change your angle in order clean gunk out from various grooves, nooks, and crannies, but that\u2019s about it. It really is the definition of a rinse-and-repeat job \u2013 low on challenge, but reliant on sound methodology. It\u2019s a highly satisfying loop though, as a daunting 100-square-foot roof gradually becomes a clean slate to be proud of \u2013 not before leaving a second-rate Jackson Pollock and childlike messages in the dirt, that is. A majority of the levels are extensive, often taking well over an hour to scrub to 100% and gain that valuable five-star rating. And with 38 jobs in total, there\u2019s a significant amount to keep you busy. The more stars you collect in career mode, the more complex the levels you unlock. Earning both stars and cash is how you progress, allowing you to splash your earnings on better power washer equipment to make future jobs that much easier. Progression may be limited to only a few options over the course of the whole campaign, but the tangible improvements to each tool can be felt - with each, more expensive, power washer increasing in power. That being said, there's not a great deal of experimentation needed and I soon settled on my loadout of choice, complete with a long extension that maximised the washer's range, and the second-widest angle nozzle, which offers a satisfying balance between pressure and area of effect. I enjoyed it so much that I even found myself blurting out the phrase \"25-degree nozzle OP!\" as I hosed down the side of a fire station, like I was on a rampant Call of Duty killstreak. I must have looked like an idiot. Cleaning liquids \u2013 one for each relevant surface such as metal, wood etc. \u2013 can be applied, but come in fairly short supply, so have to be used smartly to maximise their effect. While they do make some challenges a bit simpler, in truth I neglected them for the most part, favouring a sharp burst of water instead as it just felt more enjoyable due to the satisfying nature of the blasts and the base level of skill it encourages. Tools, such as ladders and scaffolding, can be moved around each area to help reach dirt in high places and get a new blasting angle, which adds a light puzzle element but nothing that strays too far into challenging territory. Is power washing in real life fun? Yes No I haven't tried it, but now all I can think about is giving it a go Answer See Results Very occasionally, the levels themselves throw something different into the mix as well to keep things moderately fresh. Examples include a mansion that tests your sniping skills as you clean it from a distance behind a gated wall, and a carousel which requires you to turn it on and off \u2013 making it rotate \u2013 in order to scrub every inch of dirt. These challenges are few and far between though, and require spending only a little more brain power than usual. In truth, PowerWash Simulator is not a game that\u2019s worried about difficulty spikes or introducing complex mechanics, but much more at home treating us to a relaxing, casual affair. In this endeavour, it often found a sweet spot that kept me coming back for more. Every so often, frustration can set in when trying to find the smallest speck in quite a large area, though. I found myself scouring the seemingly endless floor of a skatepark looking for smudges of dirt with a highlighting tool in a manner not dissimilar from using a UV light to uncover the more unsavoury stains at a crime scene. However, it\u2019s a bit less exciting than that because the only crimes being committed here are unforgivable levels of uncleanliness on show from whoever owns these properties. It's not taking itself too seriously, and it would be frankly bizarre if it did. \u201c Maps range from the mundane to the fantastical, with riffs on fairytale homes, a suitably red-dusted Mars rover, and a statue from an ancient civilization. There\u2019s a very loose plot to trace, but PowerWash Simulator clearly isn\u2019t too worried about telling a great story \u2013 it\u2019s all about getting you cleaning as varied and interesting a set of buildings and vehicles as possible. It's not taking itself too seriously, and it would be frankly bizarre if it did, with some genuinely amusing moments coming from the texts you receive from clients and their oddball messages. There\u2019s no voice acting to interrupt the silence. Outside of the single-player campaign, there\u2019s the option to play the whole of career mode with a friend in co-op, or any job unlocked in free-play with up to five other players. There are no competitive options aside from racing against the clock to clean like the wind in the challenge mode, but it does serve as a relaxing space to treat as a chat room while you subconsciously hose down a carousel inexplicably covered in a field\u2019s worth of mud."

That's the pitch on Lightyear Frontier, a cozy crafting exploration game with a unique mech-based twist to its farming. I mean, mechs for civilian use are hardly a new concept, but I can't actually remember a game giving it a proper shot like this. Lightyear Frontier does its best at its Early Access launch, delivering a fun romp around an alien world that's a bit short on story but goes long on customization and decoration. Unsurprisingly, the mech itself provides a lot of the fun here. It takes what would otherwise be a pretty predictable crafting and exploration game and gives it a new point of view \u2014 quite literally! You can get used to the scale, but jumping out of your mech immediately reminds you that the trees you tower over are still properly sized, or that the alien chicken creatures you enjoy feeding are as tall as a person. The mech driving is well done, too \u2014 this is a big, stompy piece of equipment, and if you've ever driven an older diesel tractor you'll recognize the clattering sound of that engine in Lightyear Frontier's Farmech. However, I am always sad to see a static, non-functional control panel in a digital cockpit. Lightyear Frontier Early Access Gameplay Screenshots 15 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Lightyear Frontier's biggest conceit is that it's a purely peaceful game. There's absolutely no combat here, and no real time pressure either \u2014 it's designed from the ground up as a chill experience. There are in-game days that tick by, but you're not required to sleep in a bed at night or anything, and there are no time limits to run up against. It delivers well on that angle as I found its relaxed pace to be pretty soothing. In fact, if you try to rush or optimize your way through it you'll probably stress yourself out for no reason. Lightyear Frontier is at its best when I realized it just wanted me to explore, find stuff, and enjoy myself. It's a game as much about taking in its nicely handcrafted, open alien world, building cool stuff and decorating it as you go, as it is about farming and crafting. The beginning is a little slow though, even with the intended pace in mind. Your starting, no-upgrades mech feels a bit sluggish when it's not sprinting, and you can't sprint if you're over your inventory limit\u2026 and the starting inventory limit is pretty low, which kinda hurts the giant super-strong robot vibe for me. That, and the storage boxes are a pain to manage, since Lightyear Frontier lacks that now-quite-mandatory feature where crafting stations pull from nearby storage for you. Nonetheless, once I got a few upgrades and unlocked some larger storage I forgot all about those first slightly frustrating hours. It's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. \u201c Frankly, that\u2019s because it's just really fun to stomp around and break stuff. The details in the mech's tools and equipment are delightful twists on the themes of giant robot stuff. I loved shattering rocks and trashing trees with the giant chainsaw-slash-stake-driver, which only gets stronger and more destructive as you get more upgrades. Trees are planted with a huge sapling cannon to plunge seeds into the earth, while crops are sown by a scattershot seed machine gun that later gets a lock-on function. There's also the two tread-based modes: One's a path-breaking modification that lets you satisfyingly roll out dirt or stone paths, which then actually make you travel faster, while the other is a plow that lets you place freeform planting spaces for your crops across the surface of the world. My favorites, though, were the two most dual-function tools. The first, a giant vacuum, lets you pull up weeds and mature crops with remarkable speed. The second, a water spraying cannon, is initially a fairly weak blast hose that later becomes a long-distance stream that can charge up spheres of water and hurl them as soil-moistening explosions. And when you run out of water? Just go vacuum up more. What's your favorite co-op crafting job? Upkeep: Farming, watering Progression: Crafting, building Supply: Gathering, mining Exploration: Scouting, fighting Other - Leave a comment below! Answer See Results Those two tools are also vital because they're used to clean up the world around you. Your satellite buddy PIP-3R (that's Piper) narrates as you explore, but the world you're on had some previous inhabitants that left behind a huge mess of ground pollution. That wells up in the form of gooey gunk piles and a breed of mutant weeds that not only kill off surrounding vegetation but spread on the wind \u2014 occasionally even threatening your own farm. It's a fun little twist on weeding to catch them out of the air before they choke out your crops. Cleaning up the world unlocks more regions to explore, like thicker forests, twisty mountain paths, and coastal plains. You\u2019ll get new resources from each one that are then used to build additional equipment and buildings, as well as unlock more mech upgrades \u2014 like a stronger hose to wash down bigger goo piles and clean up even more new regions. It'll also attract attention from neighbors who are full for character, like a traveling trader who visits for a few hours each day to buy your stuff. There's another character \u2014 a plant science enthusiast who needs regular deliveries of produce and supplies \u2014 but I wasn't able to interact with him due to a bug that developer Frame Break tells us is getting fixed in an upcoming patch. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier. \u201c As for those ancient inhabitants that left all the ruins and mess? Well, I'm not saying it was aliens, but\u2026 You can explore the old ruins around the map, all of which send you on a kind of prop hunt in old buildings or caves that unlock new alien-themed stuff to build. Cleaning up the world also gets you bits of lore about what the ruins might have been for and commentary from Piper. This Early Access story is the weakest part of Lightyear Frontier, and quite disappointing in relation to the rest of the experience \u2014 not because it's outright bad or anything, but because it's very short and very sparse right now. It took me about 15 hours to clean up the world and get to the rather abrupt, pretty unfulfilling end, which is quite literally a popup screen saying the campaign is over as of its Early Access launch. I can clearly see where this will be expanded and improved over time, but right now that ending comes when things are just getting going. A short or open-ended story isn't a sin in a game like Lightyear Frontier, it just has to be paced in such a way as to deliver a real arc or end that feels like it's feeding into the post-story activity of building a larger farm and unlocking all the decoratable stuff. After all, I \"finished\" in 15 hours but spent another five excitedly exploring the new areas I had just unlocked, getting more mech upgrades and making the new buildings and decorations I now had access to. Speaking of decorations, there are a lot of them, and I was happy to do all kinds of customizing. You can get different parts for your mech, and even mix-and-match them or paint them to create custom looks. You can also build all kinds of neat little doodads to place around, decorating the world with outposts and campsites. It's hard to feel too disappointed by a game where you can make a garden of odd rock sculptures and then decorate it with even odder alien rock-plants."

In the case of Far: Changing Tides, a sequel to 2018\u2019s lovely and underappreciated Far: Lone Sails , bigger certainly means more to do and see, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those things are any more interesting. It\u2019s still an absolutely gorgeous and at times almost meditative roadtrip across a world full of stunning vistas and clever puzzles \u2013 but developer Okomotive\u2019s efforts to make it a more mechanically varied journey, while successful, also inadvertently tip the balance of the original\u2019s formula from peaceful to tedious at times. Far: Changing Tides puts you in control of an almost comically small person, at least compared to the large sailing vessel they are piloting all on their own. Like its predecessor, it tells a story with little-to-no words, communicating information through visuals to generally strong effect. Most of the time you may not know exactly what you\u2019re doing in this apparently post-apocalyptic world, but you\u2019ll never feel lost either, and never lose motivation to keep sailing toward the right in search of some salvation or another. FAR Changing Tides Screens 10 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Propelling your ship is either done by unfurling a sail on top of it or by hopping around its innards to manually fuel and fan a giant engine. It\u2019s a fun little dance to do, asking you to scavenge resources to burn from beneath the waves as you travel, make sure the engine doesn\u2019t overheat, and perform other little tasks in order to keep you sailing smoothly \u2013 not to mention you\u2019ll occasionally have to hop out entirely in order to address larger obstacles blocking your way, like massive closed gates or abandoned buildings. Once you get a specific upgrade, your ship even has the ability to dive below the water itself and basically become a submarine, cleverly allowing you to go under some roadblocks rather than through them. But while that\u2019s a flashy addition, the most impactful change from the original is that raising your sail isn\u2019t quite as simple this time around. Rather than just pressing a button, you first have to raise a mast, then climb it, grab a rope to attach back down below, and finally adjust the position of the sails to match the frequently shifting wind for optimal speed. Additionally, there are obstacles in the background that your sails can run into and get damaged, as well as low overhangs that will knock down your mast. These additions do make the process of sailing without your engine more engaging, but unfortunately it\u2019s mostly in the same way that you have to be \u201cengaged\u201d while trying to swat a fly. While Changing Tides\u2019 scenery is beautiful, the 2D perspective makes it annoyingly difficult to determine whether or not your sail is actually going to hit something. Additionally, unless you are already on the roof of your ship, you often have very little time to react between seeing an oncoming overhang and actually being able to do something about it, even when zoomed out. What that means is that some of my absolute favorite moments in Lone Sails \u2013 catching a breeze and simply enjoying its sights and music after a stressful stretch of powering the engine \u2013 are essentially gone, with those sections now occupied by the worries of sail management, threat assessment, and running inside to check your radar to make sure you\u2019re not missing items hidden beneath the waves. These added tasks are still entertaining but make for a very different overall vibe, and it\u2019s one I grew tired of more quickly. Thankfully the areas you are sailing through are still a feast for the eyes and ears. The subtle score perfectly fits the terrain around it (even if it\u2019s not as memorable as Lone Sails\u2019 incredible soundtrack), and your path to the right is frequently full of moments you could screenshot, print out, and post on an art gallery wall without them looking out of place. The underwater sections can be particularly gorgeous, with one highlight being a cluster of fluorescent jellyfish that I swam through along the underside of my ship. There are some cool scripted moments throughout the nearly five hours it took me to complete Changing Tides, too \u2013 none of which I would want to spoil. They are grandiose in both scope and scale, and they do a good job of adding jabs of adrenaline to an otherwise slow-paced game. In fact, they\u2019re also the only real source of tension you\u2019ll find, as it felt like there was very little risk of anything going terribly wrong unless it was explicitly designed to do so this time around \u2013 a far cry from memories of my vehicle in Lone Sails constantly catching on fire. That can make it feel like you\u2019re just going through the motions rather than fighting to stay moving at all. Did you play Far: Lone Sails? Yes!

        "Subtitle": "Destruct-zen",
        "Content": "On the surface, simplicity and accessibility seem to be the common denominators defining casual gaming's best -- really, what makes go-to games great is their mastery of instant tension and speedy release. Few things are more stimulating in games than the sensation of not knowing whether you'll succeed or fail. An excellent title gives players of any skill the control -- and a splash of luck -- to complete any task. Wreckateer is an excellent example of a game understanding everything that makes experiences like it such fun to play. The premise and execution are simple and accessible: you aim and fire various ammo at destructible castles. The Kinect-powered airborne attack input is a terrific balance of anxious waiting and satisfying result. You rely on yourself as much as fortuitous physics when you make your mark. Wreckateer has all the necessary components to make an amazing casual puzzle game, yet it falls just short of \"irresistible addiction\" and instead settles for \"amusing distraction.\" As an intern under two veteran wreckateers, you're learning their methods to demolish goblin-infested castles with a ballista. The story starts and stops there, and it's all the excuse you'll ever really need. Firing simple rocks escalates into more elaborate ammunition types, and each requires careful aiming and delicate babysitting right up until the moment it makes something crumble. Even as you aim for dynamite strapped to walls, there's a strange, soothing calm to Wreckateer's demolition. The wait between attack and result is a long one, and you're involved throughout all of it. You'll fling your arms about to add spin to your shots, detonate bombs, rip one rock into four small ones, and float flying bullets through points collectibles. Each time your shot makes its mark, there's a satisfying crunch as castles crash to the ground, onto each other, or into groups of their evil occupants. Watching the points rack up alongside badges earned for risky shots or wrecking houses reinforces that good feeling, even more so when you've filled the multiplier bar. It's a stellar feeling after 15 seconds of wondering whether or not you're going to get where you want. You never know which four to five shot types -- such as a winged projectile you can steer with your arms and the aforementioned chunk that splits into four smaller stones -- you're getting when you start a stage for the first time, and part of the puzzle is figuring out which serves the best purpose, and in what order. This keeps each of the 60 levels, spread across four hours or so, more interesting than the actual levels. There's no identity to any of the 10 worlds. Some have snow. Some have canyons. Some have a darker hue. But the actual layouts aren't very interesting in the grand scheme of things There's only so much you can do with assorted layouts of walls and towers, and Wreckateer exhausts its options early. Although it's entertaining to break stuff, you'll want to do it in very short bursts so it doesn't blur together. Late in the campaign, Wreckateer mixes things up with new variables. Sometimes you need to collect floating power ups to cross a canyon or punch through multiple towers. Without using this stuff, you'll fail, and failure is Wreckateer's greatest enemy. Certain stages makes it suddenly -- and incredibly -- hard to meet the bronze medal's minimum requirements to proceed. By the time I finally earned it, I didn't know what I'd done differently, and I didn't want to keep playing. It's frustrating to go from having a good time lazily smashing stuff and solving puzzles to replaying the same stage a dozen times. Even if it weren't a cute and fun puzzle game, Wreckateer's use of Kinect is a beacon of hope that this device is worth using. Wreckateer employs and understands a few basic gestures, so there's little room for you to fail because the sensor wasn't listening. Wreckateer knows the limitations of the device and leverages them to its advantage. You can squeeze some precision out of broad movements, which future motion games could learn from.",

The organization is apparently hurt that Mama hasn't produced an all-vegetarian edition of her casual cooking series.  Let's hope PETA doesn't catch wind of Animal Boxing , a game that consists entirely of a human beating the snot out of critters.  While it's an original concept that looks great and literally turns the DS on its head, the tap dance gameplay gets old fast.  You play as a human who, for whatever reason, has decided to live in a village of anthropomorphic animals.  Things are peaceful until a boxing gym is erected and everyone's animal instincts kick in.  You'll need to assert your position at the top of the food chain by punching every rooster, gecko, and panther in town.   These animals need to be reminded of their place. Jabs, hooks, and uppercuts are all performed by tapping and drawing on the touch screen.  The most unique aspect of Animal Boxing is that it requires the player to turn their DS upside down so that the touch screen is on top.  To jab, you tap on your opponent's face or stomach.  A hook is produced by drawing a line from the side of their head onto their face.  An uppercut is done by drawing a line up through their body.  The buttons or D-pad (depending on which hand you use) are for blocking and dodging, but most animals can be defeated by frantically tapping all over the touch pad.  I mean, we are the superior beings, after all.  The bouts tend to drag on a little long in Animal Boxing, partly because you can't KO your opponent.  You have to get a TKO (technical knockout) and put them down three times.  Failing that, the boxer who landed the most punches when time runs out is the victor.  Adding to the sluggish feeling of the game are long load times in between matches.  Developer Gammick produces great artwork (see the recent Zombie BBQ), and the character designs and animation are great here.  Each animal is differentiated from one another and has its own liveliness.  There are 50 creatures waiting to be unlocked.  They aren't as individual as Punch-Out!, though, so all of that fun of studying their behavior and learning their secrets is missing.  The music is pretty forgettable, there aren't any crowd noises, and every animal makes the same sounds.",

        "Content": "    Puzzle sequels have always been a rarity, in the sense that we don't often get direct, numbered follow-ups to established designs. Spin-offs and reuses of the same brand name, sure, but 2's and 3's don't often make the cut in the titles of subsequent installments. Columns III: Revenge of Columns is an exception to the rule.  This third take on the early Genesis puzzler Columns was positioned and marketed as a direct sequel to its predecessor, and sought to recapture the audience that loved the original Columns by mixing up the formula that worked so well the first time around. But it didn't really work this time. Columns III adds too much, subtracts some of the good, screws up the balance of the gameplay, and ends up providing a great example of why successful puzzle games rarely get numbered sequels -- because if you got it right the first time, it's hard to mess with that perfection.   Columns III offers up an array of cartoon opponents, like this slightly sleepy spider. The premise behind the Columns series' puzzle design is that you've got an open, empty pit that fills with pieces that fall from the top of the screen, similar to Tetris. But the pieces here come in groups of three, and are always aligned in three-tall vertical columns. The trick is to rotate and position these columns in such a way that three or more like-colored pieces (or jewels) line up vertically, horizontally or on a diagonal. If you manage to do that, the matching jewels disappear and any pieces left hanging out above them fall down into the open gaps below.  The original appearance of this design was praiseworthy when it arrived in 1990, because the effect of gravity that forced pieces to fall down and fill in gaps emphasized creating combos and chains of multiple clears at once. No other puzzle game had done that before, and it's become an influential factor for the genre since. Getting good at setting up multiple moves was the only way to achieve the highest scores in the first Columns.  In Columns III, though, creating chains and combos is repurposed and fuels a different goal -- it increases your attack potential. Columns III's gameplay is built on the same foundation as before, but the whole jewel-smashing experience has been retooled as a series of one-on-one versus matches instead of a single-player, single-pit approach. Like Kirby's Avalanche or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, you've always got an opponent taking up space on the right side of the screen and working against you, trying to force you to fail by pushing your stack of jewels up toward the top of the screen.  Creating chains and combos increases a numbered meter, and for every 10 jewels you clear you're allowed to assault your opponent with one shove of their stack up to the top. The attack simultaneously lowers your stack if it's been pushed up previously, making it both offensive and defensive at once.  This is all well and good, and seems a perfectly acceptable evolution of design for the Columns series. The problem is that it makes things far too frantic. The point of the game changes from contemplative and relatively calm combo planning to a manic rush to get the next 10 jewels cleared before your opponent does, lest they be able to attack you before you can hit them with a preemptive strike. It wouldn't be so bad if Columns III offered the original single-player endless mode from the first Columns, where you could play by yourself and have a fine and peaceful time stacking jewels -- but it doesn't. An opponent is always there, no matter which mode you choose.  And there's more added on top of all this, in the form of flashing jewels and magic jewels. These specialized power pieces appear as an occasional reward for creating good combos, and can be used to further devastate your opponent by pushing up their stack some more, turning all of their pieces black and white or some other such nonsense. But all your foe has to do is activate one of their own stored 10-jewel stack attacks and your special power piece is pulverized on the spot. It's rare that they'll appear, but even more exceedingly rare that you'll actually have the chance to use them. They're essentially pointless.  Last of all worth mentioning is Columns III's support for five simultaneous players, which is a feature that isn't unheard of since it has been seen a handful of times before (in games like Bomberman '93). If you can manage to round up five Wii people, you can experience a fairly satisfactory and competitive multiplayer combat mode. But the number of people who'd even attempt to make use of such a feature is so low that it can hardly be much of a positive selling point."

It tells a tightly written tale that reaches a satisfying conclusion without ever taking too many risks on a storytelling or gameplay level. It\u2019s short but sweet, and like its furry stars stashes its most fruitful moments away until the end, just before becoming tired. As a rookie rodent researcher at Viago University, you\u2019ve been assigned the role of keeping an eye on the squirrel inhabitants of Melmoth Forest, an atmospheric setting that is tranquil to the point of being eerie. To begin with, you must find and follow a single squirrel to its stash of nuts. Sounds simple enough! The problem is that these critters only make their movements at night, so you\u2019ll need the assistance of your surveillance equipment. IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask You\u2019ll position up to three cameras during the day so you can keep track of a squirrel and follow them through the trees. Then, once you\u2019re happy with where your cameras are placed, you head back to your office/caravan to hit record on your VCR. Positioning these cameras is amixture of methodical planning and trial and error which offers a level of risk/reward if you try to second guess where the squirrel is going. Being bold with your placement can mean completing certain tasks quickly if you get lucky, on the other hand, get too smart for your own good and it could be backtracking your steps to the start which is never fun. You\u2019ll then time travel to the evening where you scrub through your recorded camera feeds to spot the squirrel\u2019s next movements and start to piece the puzzle together. Once found, you\u2019ll switch back to daytime once more and reposition your cameras to follow them further on their trail. Conveniently, these squirrels follow the same route each night, so from here on it\u2019s a rinse-and-repeat scenario over multiple day/night cycles until you\u2019ve found the end of that particular squirrel\u2019s journey. By its final chapter I was left wanting more variation. \u201c This gadgetry forms the vast majority of Nuts\u2019 gameplay, and while it's a smart mechanic, it never really develops much beyond that. Sure, your objectives alter slightly from chapter to chapter, but you\u2019ll essentially be doing the same things you were doing in the beginning as you are at the very end. Although I enjoyed the flow of methodical and relatively unchallenging puzzles, by its final chapter I was left wanting more variation. The disappointing lack in gameplay evolution is highlighted further when compared to what Nuts does so well. Nuts - Screenshots 4 Images Chief among these is its sense of style. Reminiscent (to an extent) of the stunning Return of the Obra Dinn, through a combination of post-processing and edge-detection techniques its a visually striking game that uses colour minimalistically. Rarely are more than two or three colours used in each of the handful of locations, and yet it\u2019s done to eye-catching often unnatural results; A burning orange sky may pierce through purple-shaded trees, for example. This often leads to warm, inviting woodland to explore during the day that evokes a sense of genuine calm, but at night a quick palette swap can lead to the same forest giving off an underlying, powerful sense of dread. Key to this tonal shift is the audio design: at night the soothing sounds of the forest and relaxing music are replaced by near silence apart from the odd rustle of leaves. Alongside small environmental touches like half-eaten apples littered around your caravan, Nuts does a great job of making it feel like the squirrels aren\u2019t the only ones being watched all the time. Nuts does a great job of making it feel like the squirrels aren\u2019t the only ones being watched all the time. \u201c It never veers into straight-up horror though, opting more for a tale of intrigue and mystery. Of course, that mystery all stems from the squirrels themselves and the reason you\u2019re spying on them in the first place. You\u2019re doing this to aid the Viago University in their research efforts and are regularly contacted over the phone by Nina who essentially acts as your quest giver. She\u2019s very well performed and is key to helping you find out about the history of the forest, what\u2019s going on currently, and why the squirrels are so important. Tonally, it\u2019s not a million miles away from Firewatch, and indeed wouldn\u2019t feel completely out of place as one of Stories Untold\u2019s excellent chapters. I don\u2019t want to give too much away about Nuts\u2019 story as much of the joy is found in uncovering it for yourself. Suffice to say it\u2019s a neatly told tale that didn\u2019t quite go where I thought it would, or become quite as bizarre as I\u2019d imagined it might. It\u2019s well-written, though, and always had me eager to solve the next puzzle in order to gain a new breadcrumb of information. It\u2019s a neatly told tale that didn\u2019t quite go where I thought it would. \u201c It\u2019s hard to avoid the ecological message woven throughout regarding the effects of our imprint on the planet. It\u2019s a truly global sentiment created by a broadly international development team: coded in Iceland, written in Denmark, drawn to life in Canada, and sound designed in Germany, it's a testament of what can be made when working remotely, and at a time when spending time outdoors has come at a premium, strolling around a lush forest in search of squirrels seems a great way to escape to me.

        "Content": "Axiom Verge takes the adage \u201cimitation is the sincerest form of flattery\u201d and has it emblazoned across every moment of its 10-hour campaign. This 2D sidescroller pulls in most of the things that made Metroid such a classic experience: great weapons, interesting abilities, and a fantastic sense of progression. But where Nintendo\u2019s classic presents a memorable setting with an evocative atmosphere, Axiom Verge\u2019s world failed to leave a lasting impression on me.   The sense of character progression throughout Axiom Verge delivers a lot of satisfaction. You\u2019re constantly stumbling upon new powers and abilities that allow you to go back and open up dead ends you passed long ago. Gaining the ability to phase through thin walls five hours in, and then using it to grab a power-up that you saw near the beginning of the game gives a nice feeling of accomplishment for those who pay careful attention to their surroundings at all times.  Likewise, seeing your hero grow from a relatively helpless guy stranded on a strange planet, to a demigod with an arsenal that\u2019d make Master Chief jealous is a smoothly rewarding process. The dozen-or-so guns you get all feel very different, and have specific uses. The glitch gun is handy for transforming deadly enemies into peaceful platforms, while ice beams help to slow down particularly chaotic enemies. My favorite tool in Axiom Verge\u2019s arsenal is a small spider drone which you can deploy and fully control to scout out sticky situations while your main character hangs back in safety.  You\u2019ll need to become familiar with all of your weapons and tools, because Axiom Verge features some awesome, challenging boss encounters. Learning their patterns and weaknesses, and ultimately slaying one of the massive beasts is a good old-fashioned rush. Controls are responsive, and the sensation of movement and combat feel great. Sure, there were a few that had me dying over and over again until I really memorized their patterns, but this was never too much of a burden thanks to Axiom Verge\u2019s quick load times and ample checkpoints  While the combat feels great, Axiom Verge\u2019s sense of exploration is a letdown. The map unfolds as a hodgepodge of identical squares that never really give you any indication of what you\u2019ve stumbled across. While I appreciate a game that doesn\u2019t hold my hand, without a clear objective I found myself getting lost far too often, especially after taking a break and coming back to the game. And without a method of fast-travel, I spent far too much time wandering back and forth across vast stretches of the map in an attempt to figure out just what the hell I should be doing.   One place Axiom Verge fails to learn from the classics is in its world design. Where Super Metroid is littered with memorable scenery and zones that feel completely different, yet spatially connected to one another, Axiom Verge\u2019s locales never really stuck with me. Nothing about the world really felt lived in, or had any memorable personality. Metroid\u2019s world made sense -- whether it was a crashed ship to explore near the planet\u2019s surface, or a zone near the planet\u2019s core that\u2019s filled with molten lava. Axiom\u2019s world just feels arbitrary.  That goes for the story, too. Where Metroid succeeds by delivering its plot purely through environmental storytelling and atmosphere, Axiom Verge often grinds the action to a halt and delivers an exposition dump onto you. The story certainly isn\u2019t bad, but I never felt attached to the characters or their problems, so pulling me out of the action ultimately turned into a chore. Finally, the twists in the final act never quite satisfied me, and instead continued to knot up the spaghetti-bowl of a story.  Switch Impressions (October 5, 2017)  Axiom Verge\u2019s Metroid-roots feel right at home on the Nintendo Switch. Its satisfying character progression, great sense of movement, and tough bosses all play great on Nintendo\u2019s new hardware. That said, my criticisms stand: I still feel like the world is forgettable, which really inhibits digging my teeth into the exploration aspect of the adventure. Likewise, the story never quite resonated with me for reasons described above. Still, Axiom Verge scratches that same itch as Metroid: Samus Returns for 3DS, and it\u2019s great to have it on the go."

        "Content": "Farming Simulator 2013 is one of the purest and most focused business simulations I\u2019ve ever played. You own a farm in a country town, and your only goal is to grow crops to make as money without any \u201cfinal objective\u201d to chase. There are no scores, storylines, cosmetic money sinks (such as new player skins or houses), or other long-term goals. You simply choose a crop from four possible seeds to start your career, plant it in your field, harvest it, sell it and put that cash back into the farm. It\u2019s almost impossible to damage your crops unless you\u2019re not paying attention, so it\u2019s difficult to fail or find yourself in a no-win situation. Still, you should harvest as much as you can because of the sheer number of investments you can make into your business. There are dozens of licensed vehicles, forty plots of land (of which you only start with one), and additional buildings such as solar collectors and greenhouses that you can sink your money into. As you increase the number of fields you own, it can take more than a dozen tractors and tools to coordinate all the work and minimize downtime. It could take hundreds of hours of work to afford everything, but you have complete freedom in how you accomplish your goal and what your priorities are. Livestock, more or bigger fields, and faster machines are all available, so you\u2019ll have to think about what best suits your particular play style. More valuable crops take extra work and extra machines in order to maximize your profits, so you need to decide whether you\u2019re willing to make the investment or stick to simple but low-value crops. The entire system gives you a tremendous amount of freedom in how to best approach your business, although that first week will be fairly slow-paced. The most unusual aspect of Farming Simulator 2013 is the complete lack of competition. In a single-player career, there is only you, the farm, and the AI townspeople who wander around but can\u2019t be interacted with. Even in multiplayer, all players work together on a single farm. In both modes, the game will not fail you for slow production or even no production at all. As a result the gameplay is incredibly peaceful, though possibly a bit daunting for newcomers to the series. Admittedly, the act of virtual farming doesn\u2019t sound like it would require a complex series of steps to perform, given that most of your job involves jumping in a tractor, attaching a tool, and slowly driving in straight lines. However, there are subtleties that are under-mentioned or completely undocumented that require some practice to master. AI-controlled workers can be hired for most tasks, and watching how they perform can teach you techniques to use when you get behind the wheel. Hiring those workers is the key to running a successful and profitable farm, especially when you\u2019re trying to manage a half-dozen fields or more at once. The tutorials will help smooth out the learning curve, but the lessons are a mixed bag. All the tutorials focus solely on controls rather than techniques or theories. By the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll know exactly how to drive all your vehicles but not other essential tasks. For example, there are five selling points for your crops around the town, and each accepts different freight. The map doesn\u2019t tell you what each building is, so you\u2019ll have to drive around to learn the lay of the land. The map itself is huge, so you may get mixed up when you first start out. It\u2019s a step backwards; the previous game in the series featured a tutorial that had you take a tour of the town and learn what exactly the buildings did, so it\u2019s strange that it\u2019s not included in this version. Those aren\u2019t the only presentation missteps. To help keep you busy during those slow early days, you\u2019re given regular \u201cmissions\u201d to earn you some extra cash. There is no punishment for failing a mission, and they pay really well when you\u2019re starting out, but they\u2019re executed poorly. There are only two types of missions that ask you to mow some grass or move heavy equipment across the town. The problem is, you don\u2019t have the equipment to perform either mission when you start off with a new career, so you\u2019ll be forced to decline the mission unless you spend all your first-day profits on the machines. Further, the mission types seem a little strange\u2026 no missions for delivering certain crops to certain houses? No scrambling to save a field from a pest outbreak? How about a mission where you have to drive your water trailer to assist the fire department to help extinguish a burning building? While reward money is good, mowing grass is incredibly boring, and the mission system simply doesn\u2019t feel rewarding enough. Despite the documentation and information the developers failed to provide, the community is incredibly friendly and helpful. It takes a certain kind of mentality to play Farming Simulator at length, and that mentality doesn\u2019t lend itself to griefers or trolls. As a result, you can hop into any public game or browse the forums to find dozens of people ready to help you learn the basics and answer your questions. I\u2019ve joined several multiplayer games of Farming Simulator 2013 blindly and never encountered any player who was unwilling to share helpful tips. Up to nine other players can join a farm that the host has taken online, and all those hands can make a serious difference in how much work gets done. Players can be instantly kicked or banned by the host, and any vehicle or tool can be reset with two clicks of the mouse in the map view, so there is simply no room for players who won\u2019t behave. All money earned goes to the farm owner (the host of the game), so other players are there just to help out and socialize. Without competition in any form, and because any save file can be used in single- or multiplayer, all players naturally gravitate toward helping each other accomplish goals in their farms. It\u2019s a relaxing environment that encourages teamwork and communication above all else. Graphically, Farming Simulator 2013 is quite far behind the curve, but I suspect no one is getting it for state-of-the-art beauty. All the machines look good and are fantastically animated, but the environment is full of low resolution textures and low-polygon-count objects. It looks better than the previous game in the series, but that\u2019s not saying much. While the graphics are serviceable for the most part, there are blatant draw-in lines that make for some ugly moments. You can\u2019t adjust your draw-in distance in the option screen, so even if you have a top of the line computer, you won\u2019t be able to stand on a hill and watch amber waves of grain sway in the breeze. In fact, while you can usually tell what\u2019s going on with your farm just by the textures, certain states of the land (such as whether it\u2019s wet with fertilizer) are actually cut off with those short-distance draw-in lines. That means you won\u2019t be able to know exactly how much a particular field has grown unless you\u2019re practically on top of it. The map view helps offset this problem, but it\u2019s still a problem that can\u2019t be ignored. There is no music to speak of, and any sounds in the game are limited to the engines of your vehicles. This helps sell the atmosphere, but your ears may be a little bored. Your best bet is to put on some music while you play. As with previous entries in the franchise, Farming Simulator 2013 has mod support for future machines, maps, livestock, or buildings. Although mods were sorely lacking for the American release of the previous game, there were several large official DLC releases, so hopefully more content will be available in the coming months."

The pictures themselves are nice to look at, but the gameplay is just so slow and boring I'm wondering if it's a game of relaxation, or a test to see if it can put someone to sleep.  There are three different control schemes to choose from and all of them are awful. The accelerometer controls are horrid. Trying to get the columns lined up is an impossible task. Hitting the touch screen will change the order of the jellyfish but the whole thing is tedious. Gestures mode is even worse. You use your finger to flick the column back and forth and move your finger up or down to change the order. The only halfway decent control scheme is Tap Screen controls. Tap on the left or right side of the screen to move the column over and tap the top of the screen to change the color order. Of course, half of the time, you'll accidentally hit the menu button doing so.  The graphics are nice. The music is a relaxing tune, but so repetitive that you really need some variety.

If you never played either of the DS Scribblenauts titles, your first play session with Remix will feel nothing short of magical. Each of the 2D side-scrolling puzzle stages has a simple goal: reach the star. The magic comes in how players actually accomplish said goal.  At any time players can bring up their device's keyboard and type in the name of an object. Any object. That object then appears within the stage, ready to use. Yes, any object. The only exceptions are proper nouns (no specific people or trademarked brands) and \"adult\" items.  The game's first level showcases this freedom, as well as the depth of the game's dictionary. Players must get a star trapped on top of a tree. You could get it with a ladder. Or chop down the tree with an axe. Or bring down the tree with a giant beaver. Or burn it down with a fire. Or simply make a helicopter and fly up to the star. Or throw a baseball at the star to dislodge it. Or create a bulldozer and knock it over...     Did+we+like+it?  Outside-the-box thinking makes all of Remix's puzzles trivially easy. I was excited to see that one stage's goal was to get rid of a bogeyman so a little boy would sleep. What object would get rid of a bogeyman? But then I just spawned a dragon, which killed the monster. Level won. In another stage I needed to protect a family from some zombies. Solution? Spawn another dragon.  Luckily it's almost more fun to mess with the game's dictionary than it is to solve the actual puzzles. Like Super Scribblenauts, in Remix players can put adjectives in front of nouns to modify them. So \"dragon\" could become \"giant black dragon,\" \"zombie dragon,\" or \"peaceful dragon\" among plenty of others. This makes playing around with the Scribblenauts' sandbox a ton of fun. I spawned a peaceful Cthulhu and had God riding him, while I rode a giant pink octopus around a pond.     Should+you+buy+it?  As its name implies, Scribblenauts Remix is comprised mostly of content from the first two Scribblenauts titles \u2013 40 \"fan favorite\" levels, and 10 brand new stages. So gamers that have played Scribblenauts to death won't find much new content here. But if you're new to the series, Remix is a no-brainer. The built-in iOS keyboard makes typing nouns a breeze, and multiple control setups make controlling Maxwell equally easy.  So not only is remix the best-looking and best-playing iteration of Scribblenauts, it's also the most affordable, at just $5. Even used copies of the original games cost more. ",

        "Content": "Canada's blessed the world immensely over the years.  From its celebrities to its moose population, there's a lot to thank America's hat for.  However, one thing in particular that Canada should issue an apology for is its cartoon series Di-Gata Defenders .  And by default, that apology should extend to cover Di-Gata Defenders DS.  Defenders is a traditional RPG through and through.  Turn based battles, equipment, side quests -- it has it all.  You even get to play as a mysterious stranger who saves the world.  Granted, these very trends are the core of several RPGs (and several great ones at that), but Di-Gata Defenders manages to bring out the utter worst in this formula.   In the snowloands of Yada Yada, you must find the Sacred Stone of Who Cares. As soon as you fire up the cartridge, Di-Gata Defenders erupts into a pseudo-anime intro with high octane techno music.  You might not know anything about the series, but at least the fast tempo beats will keep you awake.  Sadly, this brief moment of excitement is all the game has to offer.  You begin by customizing your character.  You can change your face, clothing, and stats.  You customize your stats by choosing one of several sigils with names like Infinis, Ogama, Yin, and Yan.  Each sigil offers different status boosts covering all the RPG standbys: HP, Knowledge, Defense, Stamina, etc.  You've seen it all before.  Once you've customized your Defender, it's straight to the story.  While a lot of RPGs strive for great, enthralling stories, they usually find a way to ease the player into that world.  Defenders is pretty much a fanboy party from the start.  Characters just start tossing names like you've followed the series from episode one.  While the Di-Gata Defenders fan club may really appreciate this, it makes the game completely foreign to outsiders.  As it would turn out, a treasured artifact has been stolen from your clan and all of the show's main characters (Seth, Erik, Adam, and Melosa) are busy.  So it's up to you, the mysterious new Defender, to track down the thief and reclaim the artifact.  Using your stylus to walk, you can now begin your quest.  On your journey you will run into enemies in the wild.  You can see the monsters walking around, so there are no random battles.   Get within a few feet of enemies and they'll sprint at you like the rabid humans from 28 Days Later.  Upon making contact with an enemy, you will leave the world map and enter a battle screen.  As mentioned earlier, battles are turn-based.  You can choose to attack, defend, or summon.  Attacks list their accuracy rate which gives you a few options:  you can either go for a stronger attack with a greater chance of missing or choose a weak attack that is more accurate.  You can even choose your shield level for defending.  The higher the shield level, the more shield points it will cost you, and once you're out all damage will drain your HP.   Summoning a Guardian will bring your guardian into play.  Guardians are like Summons from Final Fantasy games and will help you fight for three turns.  During these three turns, they will take any damage directed at your character and attack enemies.  Knowing exactly when to summon your Guardian can be a critical factor in winning.  By progressing through the story and completing side quests, you can acquire several other Defenders.  Each one offers different attacks and statistics.  Finding a Defender that suits your playing style can give you a decent advantage in a fight.  While the description of Di-Gata Defenders may sound like a million other RPGs at this point, it's the execution of all these factors that are done poorly.  Talking to other characters is done with dialog boxes that only indicate who is speaking by name.  In a world of characters with bizarre names it's easy to get lost or even know who to talk to.  Branching dialog selections are offered, but the options all say the same thing, just in different ways.  The graphics of Di-Gata Defenders are pretty terrible.  Character models are crude polygonal structures with extreme lack of detail.  The environments that you do so much exploring in are generally flat in color tones and reek of sheer blandness.  If you saw the high-octane (and uber cheesy) intro, then looked at the actual game being played, it's hard to tell that they draw from the same source.  On the sound scene, Di-Gata Defenders is a mix of calm Asian themed music like you would hear at a Chinese buffet and dorked out techno.  While walking around, you get the Chinese buffet symphony but as soon as you enter a battle it's the Wachowski brother's personal playlist.  Battles are over fairly quick and the constant jump back and forth between peaceful Asian sounds and techno can make you downright nauseous.  The final nail in Di-Gata's coffin is its equipment system.  Like all RPGs, you want to have all of the best equipment the game has to offer.  RPG's traditionally allow you to find equipment, acquire it in battles, or buy it from a store.  Defenders uses an arbitrary trade system where you barter for new equipment.  Instead of just paying for it with money, you have to fight monsters and acquire a ton of obsolete equipment, go to town, and trade bulk supplies of one item for a better version.  Even if you like grinding in games, this trade system will make you want to turn off your DS and go outside."

Manifest Destiny takes on a whole new meaning; by 2010, I've slowly but surely conquered the Americans and other European nations, subduing them to my rule... or simply burning their once-haughty nations to ashes.  This is what Civilization V is all about.    It's a turn-based strategy game based around building up a selected society into a world power. And, yes, Civilization V can look seriously boring to the casual bystander, but for the person at the helm of the game each turn can lead to a weighty decision, giving the player a certain feeling of power that few, if any, games match.  Civilization has no campaign, instead it simply allows the players to create a world of their devising and jump right into it either by themselves or with others in multiplayer. The biggest choice a player will make is what civilization they're going to play. Each civilization is led by a great leader from history, and gets a few special benefits and units, so its' important to consider what type of victory you're out to achieve before setting your nationality. For instance the French get cultural bonuses that give them a huge bonus towards a cultural victory, while playing Germany will give players access to powerful military units like the Panzer tank that can aid in taking over the world by force. Of course you can always pick a military-focused leader and take them on a route towards a cultural victory, but this will also present a greater challenge.   Hexagons in Civ V make for more natural unit movement. Besides picking a nation, players can further customize their scenario by switching between options such as whether the world will be made of several continents or not, what era they start in (Civ moves in eras, such as Medieval, Renaissance, etc., which also influences the level of technology you have access to), and how many other civilizations they wish to compete with. It essentially makes for infinite replayability, giving players a simple tool set to craft the challenge they want in of the world over and over again.  And hell yes, this is the type of game that you want to just play over and over. Like its predecessors, Civilization V is amazingly addictive, with games commonly drawing more than five or six hours out of me in a single sitting. The reason? Because win or lose, Civilization V allows players to guide an entire society and craft their own story, taking them from the dawn of history and far into the future. I love taking the Japanese and making them into a peaceful country who wants nothing more than to make Opera houses and win over their neighbors via their culture, or take the Aztecs and fashion them into a powerful imperialistic nation that is completely fascist and obsessed with world domination. Civilization V really is what you make of it, and for me it's a good way to tell alternate stories about some of history's most interesting nations.  I say Civilization V is only \"good\" -- and not \"great,\" as I would have said about Civilization IV -- at crafting stories because I feel like the game's taken away some pretty important tools for customizing your society. In Civilization IV players could force things on their country and opposing nations in the form of religions and government. In Civilization V, though, players gather up \"culture\" as a resource, spending it every so many turns on \"policies\" that give their civilization bonuses. For instance a player might choose to put policy points into the \"Piety\" tree, giving their nation a boost to happiness and forcing them to accept an unnamed religion. I really appreciate the way the various policy trees give players a wide array of customization options for their nation, but I miss the power and ridiculous glee I got out doing things like forcing Judaism down the throats of my enemies because my Jewish Japanese empire was out to win owning the hearts and minds of my neighbors.     I could try to argue that the new city-state feature in Civilization V makes up for the lack of clearly defined religious and governmental institutions, but sadly I'd be lying. City-states are single city nations that players can either make allies of, ignore, or attack and take over. Gaining their favor grants your society access to their goods and gives you another loyal sword should your nation go to war, but ultimately I found the limited interaction I had with them pretty boring. Sure, it's fun to make a city-state that borders the opposite side of my enemy's nation an ally, watching as they attack them on their flank, but you can't do much else with them. Still, I guess I do kind of get a sick bit of pleasure of even mildly  manipulating lesser powers to achieve victory\u2026   Eventually battles use everything from cannons to robots. Winning, actually, is where one of Civilization V's weaknesses come to light. While players can win through either diplomacy (via building the United Nations and being elected the leader), conquest (by taking out all other nations), science (by building a space ship and launching it), culture (by completing five of the policy tree branches), or by having the biggest score in the year 2050, in all the games I played it seemed it was overly difficult to get anything but a timed or military victory against the AI when starting from the earliest period. The AI is simply far too aggressive once they're on your borders, and no amount of gifts or other concessions would keep them from deciding to attack me. Attacking would then force me to focus on my military, taking my cities' production away from building the other scientific or cultural items I needed to win. It's more than a little annoying to play for ten or more hours only to realize that the victory you've been working towards is going to be thwarted by a belligerent computer player. I mean, look, I'm all for the blood of nations on my hands, but sometimes I like to be peaceful too, you know?  Still, if combat is what you're looking for, Civilization V has it in spades, and it's better than ever. In past Civilization games you could \"stack\" enemies on a space on the board, allowing you to make gigantic armies that players had to smash against one another turn after turn -- with results only really savvy strategy players seemed to fully comprehend. Civ V , on the other hand, doesn't allow stacking at all, forcing players to use more strategy than ever. With hexagon-shaped tiles making up the board, players now maneuver fewer units so that they can surround enemy forces, or use powerful units to choke off key points like mountain passes. Ranged units can also now fire over other units, making players carefully consider every army formation. As a result, combat is vastly more satisfying than it has ever been, feeling much more like a game of chess than a simple game of my-numbers-bigger-than-yours.    Combat is just one example of how Civilization V improves the franchise, with a host of other significant changes making this the most approachable the series has ever been. For instance take the advisor system. Like the console title Civilization Revolution (and other past Civilization games for PC), players have access to a set of advisors. These advisors specialize in various branches of nation building such as military and economics, and are available at any time for players confused about how to proceed. Moreover, each time a player chooses a new construction for their city, they can easily identify which building or unit their advisors think is pertinent thanks to symbols sitting next to the options. Every place the player looks in Civ V there's helpful tips on how to proceed, as well as in depth in-game \"civlopedia\" that easily allows players to find most any detail they could need in a given moment.  Every menu or interaction in Civ V is more intuitive and helpful -- a testament to the lessons learned by a developer that's been making these games for almost two decades.  Years of experience has helped developer Firaxis understand their audience more than ever, and they've included tools in Civilization V that are going to make the community aspect of it accessible to casual players. Civilization has always had an active modding community, but unless you were knowledgeable enough about where to look and how to make them function, you probably never played any of them. In Civilization V the mods are in the main menu of the game, with players empowered with the ability to create, share, download and install mods with just a few clicks of a button. Creating and playing out your own stories is fun, but I for one think that it'll be a blast getting to enjoy unique scenarios crafted by other players. "

It's where newcomers are enthusiastically welcomed, contrary to other Western stories where folks \"not from around these parts\" are met with suspicion. It's got plenty of Western staples though; a ranch managed by a salt-of-the-earth family (even if the husband is a little unhinged), a cute main street with a saloon and general store, plenty of lovely Western accents, and of course, a touch of danger. My Time at Sandrock is an excellent entry in an ever-growing list of cozy games, consistently fun while managing to stand apart from the crowd thanks to its theme of optimism grown out of hard times. As a sequel to the post-apocalyptic RPG town sim My Time at Portia, the desert-based follow-up My Time at Sandrock is deeply familiar. Like its predecessor, you've come to this struggling town to assist in improving and growing it by building items and relationships. Learning to build an efficient workshop was a great joy, and I'm proud of how I can take on townie requests and build main story items with relative ease by the end of the 75 hours I\u2019ve spent with it so far. What we said about My Time at Portia My time at Portia is, first and foremost, a game about building, and I've had a great time doing it. From mining to taming wild llamas to dating, there\u2019s a lot to do here, and I\u2019m still discovering and unlocking new and usually interesting things. While each of its parts is lacking in some way or have annoying audio bugs, when you put them all together they bolster each other to add up to something fun. I look forward to seeing how My Time at Portia continues to evolve in the future. - Miranda Sanchez, Jan 29, 2019 Score: 8 Read the full My Time at Portia review . Along the way you\u2019ll have to gather resources, use those resources to build specific items for main story quests, side quests, or optional commissions, and then use the money earned (combined with the increased prestige of your workshop) to invest in better equipment to make even more items. It can be a grind early on, but it's just the calm kind of grind I'm looking for in these games. Progression is steady both in terms of new quests and new things to create, which meant I never lost interest. Resource gathering starts with digging through scrap piles and kicking trees, eventually working up to diving into old world ruins that are generally safe apart from the occasional trap. Mining is once again a relaxing and quiet activity that has an added drop of excitement thanks to a special rat enemy that appears at random when breaking an object. If it's slain, it'll drop gold and other valuable rewards. I appreciate that this wrinkle kept me on my toes without interrupting the flow of mining much. My Time at Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting \u201c Getting wood poses a unique challenge; as a city nestled in a desert plagued with sandstorms, keeping any deep-rooted plants alive is a priority for the townsfolk. With that in mind, cutting down any trees in Sandrock's city limits results in a fine for offenders and damages relationships with townsfolk. It's one of several ways Sandrock makes excellent use of its desert setting. I may have accidentally forgotten this once, leaving me with a warning from a cheery but concerned member of the church. The stump of the tree I almost destroyed still stands just outside my workshop as a good reminder of my mistake. Sandrock's story has three main plotlines; one is about defending the town and general area from mutant lizards called Geeglers; another is about discovering how to reverse the desertification brought on by a \"relic rush\" that sucked the town dry of resources; and finally, a hunt for a bandit called Logan, a former child of the community who went bad after mysterious events. One of the three storylines is almost always active with maybe only few days of downtime between them, so they kept me busy. I was excited whenever a new thread began as it's hard to guess what storyline is going to kick up next. Do you like combat in your farm life games? Yes, the more the better Some is fine No, I want a peaceful life I don't care either way Answer See Results IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask All three of these threads are enjoyable to pull, though I was most interested in Logan's story as his turn to banditry befuddled many in the town. It got even more enticing as his actions against the town intensified. I love how almost everyone in the town has something new to say after a major story beat as well. As you'd imagine, most story objectives are completed by building new essential items and structures, like a new water tower, or occasionally going out and clearing out baddies from old world ruins. Combat in Sadrock is similar to Portia's in that it's still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system that's best in short encounters, which is what occurs most throughout Sandrock. Aiming down the sights of guns for an alternate third-person perspective is a nice addition, but doesn't drastically improve a given fight. Dungeons in Sandrock are woefully straightforward and tend to err on the side of boring if you attempt to explore them in their entirety. Some enemies have interesting attack patterns and designs, including bosses, but with combat being so simple and my character being rather tanky, you\u2019re only ever in any real danger if you go into an area where you're drastically under-leveled. Combat is still a basic but serviceable hack-and-slash system. \u201c Sandrock allegedly boasts tons of weapons, but aside from boring throwing rocks, I only saw stronger variants of five melee options and two different guns. Finding a meaningful puzzle element or a new weapon for every forced dungeon crawl could have made them more appealing. There's an attempt to have side rooms with optional treasure chests, but exploring these dungeons to find every chest just doesn't feel worth it. Chests in dungeons and around the world rarely have anything of significant value, ranging from a small handful of money to a new food recipe. The latter is nice, but I'd prefer to get a unique clothing item, a new weapon, or maybe even a complex component that I could put toward a new project instead. In addition to the main story, there's a constant stream of side quests born out of the needs of the Sandrock residents. Some seem to happen based on the time of year, but most come from relationship benchmarks. Sandrock's residents are excellent, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface on a handful of their stories. Where Portia's residents could be dull or too stereotypical, I found Sandrock's residents to be vibrant. Plenty of residents have a mix of accents, including thick western ones that lend an air of authenticity to the Wild West setting. They lean on melodrama and iconic movie and TV references for humor, too, and it usually works well \u2013 yes, I did enjoy the mention of the knockoff Gundam show and reversals of iconic Star Wars quotes. But even so, the character writing is smart, both in being clever and going over my head when it came to some of the local researcher's in-depth science talk. My Time at Sandrock Screenshots 26 Images There's an impressive number people to meet too, with more than 45 friendable characters in Sandrock, and even more new townsfolk moving in as the story progresses. Occasional NPCs come through town for story beats as well and aren't necessarily available for friendship activities like gifting, but they add to the feel of Sandrock as a growing town worthy of people just passing through. Some of my favorite characters included a rancher named Cooper who has a knack for highly detailed rants that usually wind around the bend to end in an odd place. If you listen to his rants rather than choosing an option to fall asleep and skip them, you can even gain minor stat buffs, which was a funny surprise. Not every character is written to be friendly or chatty, though. Another one of my favorites, the doctor Fang, hardly talks at all and instead lets his raven X speak for him. He doesn't even accept gifts until you're able to convince him otherwise through persistence and eventual side quests. The side quests in question are almost always about a character's background or ambitions, or both, and there wasn't a single one I felt was a waste of time. Completing some side quests is the only way to get access to new minigames and activities in Sandrock. Doing these extra tasks earns relationship points with the involved parties, which in turn leads to new dialogue lines, bonuses like the occasional gift or shop discounts, and the potential chance for romance. There are a whopping 21 romanceable characters in Sandrock and I'll admit it was hard to choose one person to woo. Getting closer to a character isn't only an opportunity to get an extra hand at your workshop in the future, but also leads to special relationship quests. Though it can take a bit of time to build up to friendship through gifting, daily chats, and completing quests or commissions, Sandrock does a stellar job with this system and relationship progress feels much faster than Portia's. I appreciated the extra challenge managing water brought. \u201c Aside from the obvious difference of featuring new characters, another major change from Portia to Sandrock is how the desert setting plays into the town's economy and other challenges. I love how water is a focal point of not only the story but also the gameplay itself. Water is essential for running your workshop \u2013 if the water tank is empty, the machines don't work. Water can actually be crafted by gathering dew from shrubbery or using a dew collector, or barrels of water can purchased from Sandrock directly. However, if something like, say, the town bridge blows up resulting in no water being imported, water prices rise significantly. Though I didn't struggle too much with the water economy, I appreciated the extra challenge it brought when considering how I wanted to expand my workshop. For instance, when I was first introduced to farming, my other workshop machines were forced to a halt as I had to use all my stored water for the plants. Since then, I've been able to manage the water needs of plants and machines much better. Seasons impact water usage too, with the cool days of winter requiring significantly less water for your machines. There's even the occasional sandstorm that alters the residents' schedules, which also causes completed workshop items to blow away and a buildup of sand on machines that needs to be cleaned in order for them to work efficiently. In addition to the new setting, Sandrock has a great number of quality-of-life improvements, including better menus, icons above creatures to indicate whether or not they're friendly or hostile, free sprinting rather than limiting sprinting with a stamina bar, the ability to save and leave at any point rather than having to wait to go to sleep, and so much more. One of the biggest improvements is being able to build and complete item requests with items stored away in chests back at your workshop rather than needing them actively on hand. There are tons of items coming and going and getting processed into new things constantly, so not having to meticulously manage each was a huge relief. And in addition to crafting items, farming, taking care of animals, relationship building, sandfishing (fish live in sandpools here), cooking, decorating my house, and mining, there's even more to do with minigames. Some of these pop up during special holiday events, but there are also one-off games to play at almost any time at the local game center. My favorite was a simple whack-a-mole with various difficulty settings that could be played with NPCs or solo. Another great one requires you to find constellations in a star-filled night sky based on NPC requests. One of the unlockable sand racing minigames could use some tweaking to make the steering better, but I appreciate it as an option for multiplayer competitions. Sandrock is truly jampacked with choices, and like with Portia, they're almost all fun in short bursts as you jump between them. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front. \u201c There's even more to do on top of all that; there are tons of upgrades, including ones that I still don't have for my horse, for my mining jetpack and sensor goggles, and for various machines throughout my workshop. There are still romances I have to pursue (of people not even in the town yet too!), and many more side quests. Even with as many hours as I have played and all the quests I've done, I still don't have my four skill trees completed (gathering, workshop, combat, and social). That said, I do wish some of the skills were geared toward the endgame rather than the first dozen hours or so. In the gathering tree, one is specifically for digging in piles of junk for resources, which is something you only need to do in the opening few hours. I put my early points toward skills that got me more in the long run instead, so that dirt pile skill still sits unlearned. Sandrock suffers from some wavering polish on the technical front, too. On PC, assets and textures pop-in noticeably unless you manually go in and bump the settings to the highest options, which isn't ideal for a game with relatively low recommended PC specs. Xbox had similar issues as well, though the performance or quality mode didn't help with the asset loading much. While that is more of a minor annoyance and is easy to get used to, I've seen other persistent visual bugs. I've watched conversations happen through my character's skull, shrubs fly oddly in the sky, and other weird interactions. There hasn't been anything game breaking as far as I've seen, but I hope we see the sheer number of weird visual bugs get patched out over time. PC Co-Op Multiplayer  Where the campaign asks for your help in saving Sandrock from economic collapse, Sandrock's multiplayer asks for your help in building up Sandrock from its basics. While currently exclusive to the PC version, I was shocked at first to see places like the general store, scrap yard, and even the train station and train tracks were missing from Sandrock entirely. There are rockslides and junk blocking shortcuts through town, too. Up to four players can work together to clean up the town and determine what new facilities get built. Town planner progression is paced first by the group's workshop level and then by resources required to build the facility and its potential upgrades. So, like the campaign, building prestige for yourself as a builder allows you to access more. It's still a solid system and a neat spin on the campaign. New facilities also mean new people in town. I can see myself trying to convince friends to help prioritize unlocking the buildings for characters I like most from the campaign. Other key differences include removing the need for sleeping by a certain time. In the campaign, you pass out immediately if the clock hits 3:00 AM, but players can keep at it in multiplayer for as long as they want. It rocks. Better yet, there's an added nap function that can be used once per in-game day that quickly refills stamina and health. The skill trees are completely different as well, and there's an excellent daily task system and achievements not present in the campaign that can earn you extra money and experience. The three daily challenges reset after an in-game day, too, and are the same (but not shared) across all players. Players also have to share a plot of land and money and can share resources and contribute parts to build items. Miranda's Favorite Farm/Town Life Games See All My Time at Sandrock Pathea Games My Time at Portia Pathea Games Stardew Valley ConcernedApe Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Animal Crossing: New Leaf Nintendo EAD Animal Crossing: Wild World Nintendo EAD Little Witch in the Woods Sunny Side Up Ooblets Glumberland One of the best things about Sandrock's co-op is that anyone can hop into the multiplayer town even if the person who hosted it is offline, which isn't the case for one of my favorites, Stardew Valley . There's even a board where you can leave messages to friends. I was also impressed by how difficulty in dungeons scale based on the number of people going in, and they did seem more challenging than in the campaign as a result. The chests in dungeons and around the world even have good loot, with fully built machinery and items that award stat bonuses to all when they're used as decor on workshop grounds. While I was only able to play a few hours of co-op multiplayer before this review, after my brief stint I'm determined to get lots more in. There's enough that's changed between multiplayer and the campaign to justify digging deep into both \u2013 besides, it's the perfect opportunity to choose a different person to romance, too."

        "Content": "Two and a half years ago, Akella and Playlogic released Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales, an adventure/sim/RPG hybrid of life on the seas in search of treasure, fame and glory.  Apart from boarding ships and swordfighting with sailors, players could trade goods and take over cities and forts as one of two characters.  Trying to build on this sailing adventure, Akella and Playlogic have recently reteamed for the sequel.  However, Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships is bogged down by unintuitive gameplay, controls that feel clunky, and elements that aren't explained in the instructions or during your adventure, which will severely tax your patience.  Unlike the first game, which attempted to string together a storyline as you sail around the Caribbean, players are allowed to essentially make their own story and life on the sea as one of three characters: a merchant, corsair and an adventurer.  These characters have their individual stats dictated by what's called the P.I.R.A.T.E.S. system, which governs things like how quickly you can draw your sword, how much loot you can carry and how much health you have.  The same system also governs ship behavior as well, such as your navigation and combat abilities with your vessels. This system is rather complex and plays a major role in how you level up your character and improve your skills; in particular, the more you use a skill, the more it improves.  This can lead you to specialize in certain abilities as well, so if you show some skill with your blade, you can become an expert fencer and inflict additional damage on enemies.   Ah, a pirate's life for me! Apart from building your skills, you'll also build your reputation as a captain in the Caribbean by doing things like sailing into ports, hiring new shipmates and acquiring goods to keep your crew from declaring a mutiny.  As you disembark from your vessel and wander around each town, you can barter with shopkeepers, explore various homes for items, or stop by the tavern for a drink, gossip and games of chance. Players can also choose to explore the various caves and dungeons around, searching for hidden and cursed gold buried by pirates (even if they're willing to take on the undead for a bit of treasure).  If exploration isn't that appealing, you can attempt to do the bidding of governors of a territory to defeat pirates or recover lost cargo.  Even better, you can depose the leaders of a location and establish your own safe haven.  Needless to say, there's a huge amount of depth within Age of Pirates 2, and this, coupled with the seemingly unlimited cutthroats and wayward criminals that you'll come across, can keep you playing the game for quite a long time.  However, there is a major issue that arises with Age of Pirates 2, however, which makes it particularly difficult to discover all of these facets of gameplay \u2013 there is absolutely no tutorial for the gameplay whatsoever.  Apart from an extremely small crash course in swordfighting basics (the problems of which I'll get to a bit later), there are no hints, directions or guides to be found within the entire game.  It would be one thing if this was restricted by difficulty level; Age of Pirates 2 provides ten separate difficulty levels for you to test your skills (which feels like way too many and only seems to serve as a way to hasten the speed that your enemies will kill you).  However, even set on the beginner level, you aren't provided with any information as to what you need to do to control your ship, access menus or get basic character details about yourself.  As a result, you'll find that you'll stumble your way through much of the game without a full sense of how to do anything.  The manual doesn't really help either; many of the explanations about game features are very generic or descriptive without indicating specifics of what you would want to do.   Prepare for drinkin' and pillagin'! Along with the lack of a tutorial comes the lack of info about certain gameplay elements.  For example, you will come across in people in your travels to various towns that will ask you different questions related to ship life to gain special items or information.  Some of these are riddles while others are glossary terminology for parts of a ship.  Unless you have an internet browser open or have a certain amount of familiarity with ships, you're not going to get some of these questions right.  Considering that this was a facet of onshore play, particularly as you're exploring the islands and settlements on the coast, you'd hope that this was better developed.  Another issue is the lack of understandable maps or directions as you maneuver through the hills and jungles of a location.  It's possible to completely get lost on foot because there's no easy indication of where you're going, what locations are nearby or what you can run into.  While it would be understandable for a general \"fog of war,\" maps that you pick up or purchase don't even fully give you information that is useful, making for a lot of frustration as you stumble through the wilderness of each area.   Another problem that arises with the gameplay is that it places a higher premium on direct combat than indirect means or even peaceful skills.  For example, repairing your vessel that may have been damaged in a storm or trading goods in town doesn't earn you nearly the same kinds of experience boosts that wielding a sword and firing a cannon at enemy ships will.  In fact, trying to play as a peaceful trader who didn't attack anyone was an exercise in futility, as I never came close to improving my skills, making the option to be a merchant academic.  Clearly, attacking and boarding ships are the focus of the game, which isn't a surprise (it is called Age of Pirates 2, after all).  The problem comes within the nautical view for the game, which forces a slow and clunky maneuverability on your vessel regardless of class or weight on the ship.  It can actually take you up to ten minutes or longer to sail from one settlement to another with the nautical view selected, and turning from port to starboard or vice versa can take a lot of time as your sailors respond to your commands.  During peaceful voyages, this is an understandable element for simulation, and can add to the gameplay.  However, you're rarely on a peaceful voyage; sailing into, or even on the edge of, storms will frequently obliterate any control you have along with causing an immense amount of damage to your ship, and maneuvering your ship into place to line up a volley from your cannons is extremely tricky to do.  Even worse, the firing and reloading of cannons, even with a skilled crew, can take at least twenty seconds with a fully crewed ship.  Get into a battle with a fleet of ships, and you can expect the reloads to come even slower. Now, switching to the map view allows you to travel much faster, but this can also raise a few issues.  First, you're still propelled back to the horrendous nautical view if the two previously mentioned \"incidents\" befall your ship.  Secondly, the speed of the map view makes you wish that you could either simulate battles in this faster mode or would allow you to instantly leap to boarding your opponent.  Unfortunately, this isn't an option at all.  I don't expect these large vessels to be speedboats that would turn on a dime, but I'd hope for more responsiveness at least during a naval battle.   Unfortunately, the controls, especially for your ships, are clunky. Then again, I could easily say the same for boarding ships or sword fights during the game.  Instead of epic clashes with rapiers and daggers on the deck of a ship between skilled duelists, the game degenerates into hacking and slashing mobs of three or four enemies against one.  While the game system is designed to take a character's energy into account, in theory preventing a Dynasty Warriors-styled button mashing approach to attacks, any character can be overwhelmed regardless of whether they're blocking or not by the sheer numbers thrown at you.  The lone equalizer comes with pistols, which can inflict a large amount of damage on your enemies.  However, many of your shots will simply injure or severely wound your opponents, while shots from attackers will frequently kill you with one round.  Along with some of these gameplay issues comes a certain amount of visual issues that can complicate play.  The game engine appears to be at least ten years old, which really stands out whenever you're in town, with rather generic character models and buildings that appear to be repurposed from location to location.  As a result, if you go to a new location, you can sometimes find yourself feeling as though you've already been there, because the layout will feel rather familiar.  Character animation can also come across as somewhat stiff, particularly as you move and prepare to attack during combat.  Additionally, for some reason allies and enemies will sometimes pause during combat as they're being attacked without attempting to defend themselves, as if the animation for movement had been paused.  This results in providing a free opening for someone to attack them, which can be capitalized on.  Particle effects, smoke and fire are okay, but distinctly generic as well.  For instance, the lightning strikes that hit boats and cause gunpowder explosions in the middle of a storm don't provide the same visual impact that you know such an event would cause (or equal the kind of damage that you're told about once you make it out of the dangerous waves.   Expect to visit Davy Jones' Locker frequently. Musically, you've got the kind of sweeping soundtrack that you'd expect to come from an Errol Flynn movie, which does a pretty decent job of getting you excited to attack other ships and exact your own justice on the sea.  However, the sound effects seem to have been an afterthought, particularly during fights.  Much of the time, you find yourself in a battle that feels a bit muted and dies down instantly as soon as the final blow is struck.  No clanging from falling weapons or sounds from dying enemies \u2013 instead, you've simply got a resolution of most sound and dynamic battle music, which sounds weird.  One other thing for those players looking for multiplayer \u2013 you're not going to find it here.  Unlike the first game which featured naval battles online for people to battle over, Age of Pirates 2 is solely a single player experience."

        "Subtitle": "Hair-pulling slide puzzle from the crazy Skip crew.",
        "Content": "Thanks to the Nintendo DS systems' touch screen, one style of mini-game that's in abundance on the system is the dreaded \"slide puzzle.\" You know the type: you've got a picture that's divided into tiles, and you have to slide the tiles in such a way that the picture forms. I've always found slide puzzles frustrating and not much fun even though they can be satisfying when the solution's complete. To experience a ton of them on the DS because they're easy to reproduce on the slide-friendly touch panel doesn't make me a very happy panda. Skip, an extremely talented and creative group in Japan, took the concept of the slide puzzle and enhanced it for its Art Style series to create Art Style: Zengage . I can certainly appreciate what they did, and for the most part Zengage is one of the most challenging puzzle games you can find on the Nintendo DS. But it still reeks of slide puzzle syndrome, and it's a tough barrier to overcome simply because you really want to like the latest entry in a fantastic series as Art Style is.  Zengage has a brilliantly relaxing soundtrack, but that's only to keep you calm during the mind-bending and frustrating puzzle challenges. Your task is to simply slide the tiles around the playing field using both vertical and horizontal strokes, using the combination of the two to get the colored tiles underneath the same colored balls that mark the final position. Later challenges restrict how players can shift the tiles, either via gaps in the grid or specific tiles that are \"nailed down\" and cannot be moved. Early challenges are not nearly as bad as they'll get in the deeper levels, but it doesn't take long for the game to throw all sorts of variables, like a large assortment of colors, non-uniform layouts, or various special tiles, to ensure your head's going to hurt after just a few turns.   It's a glorified slide puzzle.   At the very least this is a game that's going to give you one hell of a run for your money. And if you're one of those rarities that actually love slide puzzle games, then man, this is the game for you.",

        "Content": "As my tiny boat sailed into the equally tiny port of the city-state of Portia, I couldn't help but look beyond the small town and toward a decrepit tower looming over its peaceful villagers; I wanted to go there, and it didn\u2019t take too long before I did. My Time at Portia is perhaps one of the most pleasant post-apocalyptic games out there, every part of it full of potential and an interesting sense of optimism. You'll find it in the goals and accomplishments of its people, and in My Time at Portia\u2019s design as a whole. It teases unreachable treasures off in the distance and lists items with parts I haven\u2019t yet encountered, letting me know there is something new still waiting for me. After playing over 65 hours, I\u2019m still finding more to explore and build in My Time at Portia. This town sim with an emphasis on building and resource management (and some RPG elements thrown in) is a fun adventure that, despite its flaws, I had a hard time putting down. Humanity is rebuilding in My Time at Portia. Civilization as they knew it was destroyed, and now many, many years after humans emerged from living underground, city-states have formed and your player arrives in Portia to follow in your father's footsteps and become a builder. Learning about this world\u2019s odd history has been intriguing, though the story and characters are generally far less charming than what you\u2019d find in something like Stardew Valley. The goal of the story itself is simple: expand Portia and become the top builder in town. I would have liked to have seen a more interesting driving factor for expansion other than money and prestige, but obtaining both is still a fun endeavor thanks to the impressive number of things to do in Portia and My Time at Portia\u2019s appropriately scaling growth.  Building the Basics My Time at Portia\u2019s calendar has four months with several weeks each in a year, and the first few seasons serve as a solid tutorial \u2013but even with so much to do in Portia, I didn\u2019t felt like it was dragging me around to see every attraction. Instead, it let me explore everything at my own pace, though it heavily encourages players to start by accepting timed building assignments. Building is your first priority in My Time at Portia, and the first commissions were designed well enough to help me establish a foundation in my routines for gathering resources. After either mining for ore, collecting wood, fighting monsters, or gathering other basic materials, I\u2019d add them together in a recipe to build an item. At first, gathering starts as simple as picking up stray wood and rock piles, but eventually escalates into cutting down massive trees with a chainsaw. I would sometimes dedicate whole days to just gathering resources for my next big project, but as I progressed, I gained things like the chainsaw to collect resources faster. I appreciated that as things got more complicated, new tools and services would arrive not long after to help me grow as a builder.  Those aids were important as I received complex schematics to build even bigger and more important items. They required me to process basic resources into different things before they could be used. Sometimes you have to process goods several times before they\u2019re finally made into the right component. I enjoyed pulling out a notepad to track just how many carbon steel bars I\u2019d need to build an item. Then, once done, I\u2019d submit those items for rewards, town favor, and money. I enjoyed this cycle not only because I found it to be rather relaxing, but also because the biggest assignments you\u2019re given directly change the town. I enjoyed pulling out a notepad to track just how many carbon steel bars I\u2019d need to build an item. \u201c When I wasn\u2019t focused on building, I was participating in one of Portia\u2019s unique holiday events and other activities that have some sort of minigame element, like for fishing, cooking, or taming a wild llama that I captured. The minigames are plentiful, and it was always a nice surprise to come across a new one. The complexity of the minigames vary quite a bit too, so it was helpful that most of them have simple tutorials. However, much like other farm-sim games, the onus is on the player to discover the finer points of My Time at Portia. It took me several in-game weeks to realize that I could kick trees more than a few times for special goods and that a notification would pop up to tell me when the tree was out of items to drop. This could be irritating to some players, but for someone like me who likes to live and learn in these worlds, I enjoyed the surprise of discovering something new.  I Just Want to Be Friends The one learning curve I did have issues with was figuring out how to please my fellow Portians. My Time at Portia\u2019s relationship system relies on the player chatting with residents daily, giving them presents, and playing games or sparring for relationship points. Presents give by far the most relationship points early on, but with My Time at Portia\u2019s impressive number of items, it\u2019s difficult to figure out exactly what\u2019s worth giving away. Very few item descriptions give clues to what might be liked by others, and even items I thought a person would enjoy based on their personality usually didn\u2019t work out. Building relationships in the early stages takes way too long without that important information. On the plus side, gaining friendship with one person awards you free friendship points with the people closest to your new friend.  At first glance, a majority of the characters seem more like caricatures rather than real people, and their starting few dialogue lines don\u2019t always make sense. Look, I get it Russo, you\u2019re a dedicated butler, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re always getting food for someone at all hours of the day as he claims to be doing when I talk to him. The clumsy dialogue early on thankfully takes far better shape after gaining people\u2019s friendship and during events. New dialogue lines did make me feel like they were trusting me with better information about themselves. New friendship levels also mean more activities, which further diversify what you do in My Time at Portia. The clumsy dialogue early on thankfully takes far better shape after gaining people\u2019s friendship and during events. \u201c Once friends, you can accept or extend invitations to \u201cplay.\u201d It\u2019s a weird title for the mechanic, but it\u2019s basically a bundle of minigames you can do to increase your relationship. You can launch fireworks, chat under a tree, play minigames and eat in the local pub, and plenty more. The activities change if you\u2019re on a date and if you\u2019ve built up Portia to a certain level. I particularly enjoyed seeing how my efforts to develop Portia returned to me in fun minigames and events. For instance, one mission asks you to clear a supposedly haunted cave so that the mayor can turn it into a tourist attraction. After completing that mission line, you can go in that cave alone or with a date to hunt \u201cghosts\u201d for points. Eventually, you can go on to marry select people in Portia. What I like about this marriage system is that your partner will actually help around your workshop. And, if you marry the right person, you can receive discounts at their shop or helpful stat bonuses \u2013 though you can get lesser levels of these benefits by just becoming friends. Overall, the relationship system is worth investing in, but I do wish it were tuned better so that the start of a relationship felt less like a chore.  Adventure Time The RPG layer of My Time at Portia is light and easy to manage on top of everything else. Leveling up gets you more stamina, which powers most things you do, plus improved health, attack, defense stats and a point to put into one of the three skill trees \u2013 there\u2019s one for battling, another for gathering, and the third for social. The skills were essential to increasing the efficiency of activities since they mostly offered passive bonuses. For example, as I needed more resources, I invested points in the gathering skill tree for a chance to get double item drops. It ended up being incredibly helpful \u2013 and lucrative. It seems no matter what I do, Portia continues to encourage me to keep going for more because it still has more to offer. \u201c One of my favorite things to do in My Time at Portia was mining. It\u2019s a relaxing and repetitive hunt for goods within the earth that pairs well with podcasts and audiobooks. There are several mines in Portia and each of them house different kinds of ores and relics. The relics are old-world items that are split into various parts and can be reconstructed. Yes, there\u2019s yet another layer of things to do in Portia. Those relics can be donated, sold for a fair bit of money, or placed in your house for bonus stat points that increase your characters stamina, attack, and other attributes. I\u2019ve been obsessively trying to reconstruct all the items I\u2019ve found, and some of them have proven to be extra difficult. The tracker I use to find relics has already been upgraded once and has been incredibly useful in my hunt. It seems no matter what I do, Portia continues to encourage me to keep going for more because it still has more to offer. Completing big story requests open new areas on a surprisingly large map, and in those new areas are at least a new type of resource, a new mine, or even a new dungeon. Some of the most fun missions were the ones where I accompanied the local peacekeepers in taking on larger groups of enemies to solve a bad situation. Otherwise, the dungeons were yet another good way to change up my days. Combat is simple hacking and slashing, but the variety of enemies keep things interesting enough. The dungeons are divided into several levels, each with their own rooms and a boss in the last room. Though I liked how dungeons were often a mix of a few basic puzzles and a handful of enemies, I do wish that the boss waiting at the end of each level were different. Some dungeons share bosses, and the ones I encountered only really required me to have some extra health items and a higher level than them to defeat."

        "Content": "You'd figure that an action RPG managing to merge tight 2D platforming, thrilling combat, and a thought-provoking story would be an all but impossible task, yet Indivisible makes it look easy. Developer Lab Zero Games proved it knew its way around a fight stick with the 2012 fighting game Skullgirls, but this is its first foray into the realm of dice rolls and level-ups. The result is one of the most wildly creative RPGs I've played this year.  Indivisible is set in a beautiful world where myth and spirituality are as tangible as the ground beneath its people's feet. Several years before the beginning of the story, a band of heroes banished a fearsome deity named Kala before she could bring about the apocalypse. Ajna, Indivisible's hot-blooded teen protagonist, grew up in the peaceful years that followed the big bad's banishment, but that calm is swiftly burnt to a cider when her village is set ablaze by invaders.   \"Here we go again,\" I thought, assuming Indivisible would staunchly adhere to a typical RPG hero's journey as Ajna vowed revenge and brashly took to the open road. And while the plot is a bit trite in the early goings, it quickly grows beyond any familiar tropes and into a unique story that I came to love thanks to Ajna's character development. Whenever a problem rears its head, her first reaction is to throat-punch it and move on, insisting that it's her way or the highway. If she wants to be a true hero she has to confront her egoism and realize anger is a fool's paradise. Otherwise she won't open her third eye and access the hidden powers buried within her.  Be Water My Friend  Indivisible is built on two types of gameplay: 2D platforming while exploring and party-based fights with cooldown-centric combat reminiscent of Valkyrie Profile\u2019s turn-based battle system. It was impressive how well the two blended early on, but I was worried Indivisible might come apart at the seams as it juggled increasingly intricate level design and more combo-dense fights. It was a pleasant surprise when my concerns turned out to be for naught, and the mix was intoxicating from start to finish.  Its Metroidvania styled platforming is nothing to scoff at. The first real test came in the form of an underground temple full of wall-jumping and leaps over hazardous spike pits. It made for fun navigation, but was still pretty standard platforming fodder \u2013 that is, until I found the axe, which lets Ajna scale up walls more easily. Suddenly, more of the temple opened up because I had a tool that increased mobility and cleared obstacles. A doorway covered in tree roots isn't such a big deal when you can chop away wood.   That's what makes the mobility items you find throughout Indivisible so much fun: they always have a dual purpose. Take the spear, for example: your first inclination might be to waltz up to enemies and stick'em with the pointy end, which you can do, but it's more useful as a means to pole vault Ajna up to high ledges that she couldn't reach before. Retreading previous areas and trying out new toys to see what hidden pathways you might've missed the first time around gets a lot of mileage out of the world.  It's also an excellent excuse to admire all the breathtaking landscapes. From bustling Arabian-inspired marketplaces to stone-walled temples in the jungle, Indivisible is a total knockout. I've never seen a game so elegantly weave 2D sprites with 3D backgrounds \u2013 it\u2019s to the point that there's no contrast between them whatsoever.  From bustling Arabian-inspired marketplaces to stone-walled temples in the jungle, Indivisible is a total knockout. \u201c  Sometimes, though, you have to stop exploring and throw hands \u2013 and that\u2019s when it becomes apparent that Indivisible's combat is brilliant. It's a hybrid between real-time and turn-based in which each of your four party members is assigned to a face button \u2013 so pressing 'X' will make whichever character is tied to that button attack or block, depending on if the enemy is attacking at the time. Turns are linked to the entire party as a whole rather than an individual character, so you can use anyone repeatedly - or not at all. Conversely, if you want to madly tap the face buttons and send everyone in for an all out-actually, you can! There's plenty of room for experimentation, too, encouraging you to think tactfully about your party makeup because each character has vastly different utility from one another.  Synergy is the name of the game here, and a particular duo jived so well that they were rarely absent from my party: Thorani, the hydromancer with a healing touch, and Baozhai, the damage-dealing pirate queen. All of Thorani's abilities center around water, so whenever she casts attacks, puddles are left scattered about the area. She can then make it so these puddles damage foes that step in them and, conversely, heal party members that do the same. Baozhai, on the other hand, needs to plunder booty from enemies to up her attack power. Witnessing her fire away bombs and gold from her shoulder cannons while she laughs at the poor sod on the receiving end is a devilishly satisfying sight to behold.   I adored pairing these two because their skill sets complement each other so well. I\u2019d toss some rejuvenating puddles on the ground as Thorani then follow up with some gold-snatching as Baozhai, causing the latter to get the lion's share of the healing while gathering the materials necessary to up her damage. You can even time this plan of attack so Baozhai bombs enemies before they get a chance to clap back. The Thorani-Baozhai tag team is just one example of how much depth there is in the combat system, but there are a least 20 characters to be found throughout the world, each with their own distinct move sets. Some characters arrive naturally by progressing through the story, while others might require you to complete a side quest or two before they join your fellowship. I was addicted to gathering them, and even after Indivisible's curtain call 30 hours later I started a new playthrough right away to see if I could find the character's I'd missed out on the first time.  The Mind's Eye  I felt downright spoiled by the cast, each of them willing to hop into the party and share the load. My favorite personality is Ramzi, an overtly cynical pyromancer who\u2019s one shade of goth eyeshadow away from being a My Chemical Romance groupie. She enjoys the finer things in life, such as sticking bugs in people's mouths or setting the victims of her shenanigans on fire if they don't indulge her bug-eating curiosities. That said, she'll often settle for just dragging her companions \u2013 for example, one of my party members donned a scarf that obscured their face, and Ramzi's first inclination was to suggest they were hiding the fact that they had no lips. Much to her chagrin, they did, in fact, have lips. It's one of the few games ever to make me belly laugh at regular intervals.  Indivisible's writing knows when a stern talking-to is required just as much as when to be silly. Ajna is put through the wringer, learning to love imperfections about herself while opening up to her companions and lean on them in times of need. All the emotional high notes truly hit home due in large part to the incredible 2D sprite work and great voice acting. Despite its tact with heavy subject matter the storyline could get almost too real at times, so I appreciated the odd bug-eating gag to lighten the mood. That tonal juxtaposition works, and in the 30 hours I spent with Indivisible, the humor never took away from the gravity of the story. Not even when a chainsword-wielding surfer girl shouts \"RIP AND TEAR\" while dicing her foes. Oh, and the chainsword's blade is made of shark's teeth. It's glorious.   The biggest weakness is that combat difficulty has stiff peaks and valleys that can be jarring as all hell. Enemies often have enormous health pools, which results in some battles that are challenging not due to exciting mechanics, but because you\u2019re just fighting a war of attrition. Then, in the last third of the campaign, everything became a cakewalk for some inexplicable reason. Relentlessly mashing buttons didn't result in victories early on, but suddenly that becomes a sound strategy. Sure, my characters were stronger after leveling up, but your adversaries should rise to the challenge in that sense too. But even if Indivisible drops the ball with regards to its difficulty curve, that's by far its most significant sin, and I was still enjoying myself the whole way through."

Driving a hoverbike through its stylish open world or climbing giant mountains and crumbling cities can be a lot of fun in a zen-like fashion. But for all the ways it manages to delight in its simplicity, dull puzzles, distracting bugs, and poor camera controls can also occasionally turn Sable\u2019s peaceful world into a frustrating one. Sable tells a unique coming of age story, giving you control of a silent, masked protagonist in a fascinating world full of other creepy masked people, ruined sci-fi technology, and very little background to explain any of it. As a child entering adulthood, you begin a solitary quest to figure out who you are by exploring the vast desert around you \u2013 a ritual that plays out a bit like a mix between Dune and my nephew\u2019s bar mitzvah. Sable Gameplay Screenshots 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask What makes this odyssey so special is that you truly get to make it your own. After a brief introduction to teach you the basics, the world completely opens up to you with no \u201cmain questline\u201d and only a few suggestions of where to go. Completing quests given to you by its excellently written NPCs will earn you magical masks, and once you\u2019ve obtained just one you could turn around, go home, and end your journey right away. I spent 12+ hours exploring all the nooks and crannies of Midden, completing every quest, and soaking in all Sable has to offer, but others could complete their pilgrimage in just a few hours if they\u2019d prefer. Every player\u2019s experience is likely to be different, and the structure of this world is incredibly well-designed to support the different ways you can approach it. No matter what paths you choose, however, the things you do in Sable will be largely the same. That includes riding a hoverbike around its visually stunning (if mostly empty) desert areas, solving simple puzzles, and doing a ton of platforming. Platforming is somewhat bare bones in its design: you\u2019ve got the ability to jump, glide slowly through the air, and climb any surface with a slowly-depleting stamina bar (because Breath of the Wild made it so that\u2019s just in every open-world game now, I guess). But despite those basic building blocks, it manages to be pretty engaging throughout, due in no small part to the beautiful terrain you\u2019ll be scrambling across. You aren\u2019t doing exciting midair dashes or using a grappling hook to swing across gaps, but the slower pace pairs perfectly with Sable\u2019s zen tone. Platforming's slower pace pairs perfectly with Sable\u2019s zen tone. \u201c That is, of course, when the camera isn\u2019t getting in the way of an otherwise good time. Like countless 3D platformers before it, Sable suffers quite a bit from a wonky camera that\u2019s constantly having dust kicked up into it when riding your hoverbike or phasing through objects when you\u2019re trying to get it into the right angle for a jump. Thankfully, Sable\u2019s platforming is decidedly low stakes and not very challenging, so it never made me rage really. But it\u2019s still an underlying annoyance that doesn\u2019t go away, and one that eventually started to steam my broccoli after long periods. Compared to its amusing, minimalist platforming, riding the hoverbike around and solving environmental puzzles holds up less well over the dozen hours I spent with Sable. Its puzzles never really present any kind of challenge or clever design that makes you feel accomplished for solving them, with most obstacles amounting to simply standing on a button or placing a battery inside a socket to power something up. It\u2019s not actively bad by any means, but also not really anything exciting to write home about either \u2013 again, just like my nephew's bar mitzvah. Similarly, riding your hoverbike around the barren deserts is a good way to see the gorgeous landscapes of Sable\u2019s ruined world, but it eventually amounts to little more than holding down the accelerator and waiting until you get where you\u2019re trying to go. You can upgrade your bike and customize its color, look, and performance, but there\u2019s not a pressing need to do so since you won\u2019t be taking it into races or battles like Mad Max or anything. That means there\u2019s not much to it, but Sable\u2019s stylish, cell-shaded environments are still so dang interesting to look at that sometimes I forgot I\u2019d been riding in a straight line for five minutes and wasn\u2019t even heading in the right direction. Once you do arrive at your destination, though, there\u2019s plenty to do, and meeting people and taking on quests are some of the best moments Sable has. The writing is excellent across the board and although you never hear anyone speak or even see their face, there\u2019s lots of memorable characters. I seriously wanted to meet everyone I could and was almost never disappointed in the hijinks and banter that followed. Sable almost always rewarded me for butting into the lives of others with quests that played out in unpredictable ways. In one quest, I posed as a fearsome vigilante to save a child, and in another I stole some poop from some bugs for science. I also climbed some giant floating crystals and ripped pieces of lightning out of them with my bare hands. Seriously, the stuff they have you do is all over the place in the best possible way. Do you need combat in your open world adventure games? Yes! They are boring without it No! I can enjoy a quieter adventure game I don't care either way Answer See Results The bugs and glitches you encounter along the way, though, are less alluring, and Sable is just teeming with them, big and small. There\u2019s everything from visual glitches like bushes that fly around and snap back in place like rubber bands or bushes that let you see through the world map when you point the camera at them (there are non-bush related bugs, too). Framerate issues and other visual blemishes like this aren\u2019t game-breaking, but they do add up to noticeably hinder the experience. One time an emotional cutscene was completely ruined when my bike seemingly cloned itself and then rammed into its doppelganger during a serious moment. It was hilarious, obviously, but probably not what the developers were going for. On the other end of the spectrum, there are also issues that actually do have more dire consequences. These ranged from getting locked out of a quest because a vendor\u2019s goods weren\u2019t showing up, to my bike becoming invisible for some reason for a few hours, to my character\u2019s money not showing up correctly leaving me guessing if I could afford things or not. Most issues were resolved by resetting a few times, but not all of them, and the threat of bugs mucking something up was a constant fear throughout my otherwise enjoyably peaceful journey."

So, Shrek enters into a Faustian bargain with Rumplestilskin to live just one day of his life as he fondly remembers it -- back when the swamp was his quiet, peaceful home and humans knew to stay out. But Rumpy is a tricky little fellow. To have this day, he must trade a day from his childhood \u2013 which sets into motion an adventure into a world where the heroic Shrek never existed, Donkey doesn't know him, and Puss in Boots is a rather big kitty.  I have not seen the movie but it appears that Gameloft stuck to the plot for this iPhone game. The eleven stages stretch across the alternate Far, Far Away where Shrek is back to being feared. And you are not just in Shrek's boots in this game. There are stages where you also play as Donkey and Puss. All three heroes are different, each with their own specialties, like Shrek's ogre scream.   Right in the kisser.  Shrek Forever After mixes a few gameplay ideas into the witch's cauldron. There are running sequences from the old Crash Bandicoot games. Basic 3D platforming from the Nintendo 64 era. Scavenger hunt collecting. Flying sequences and extreme sports grinding. You probably know where I am going with this, though. By not drilling down on just one or two ideas and really getting them right, Shrek Forever After ends up being a cobbler of half-baked scenes. Take Shrek's combat skills, for example. Basic punching with the occasional spin move and shout. Now, I'm not looking for a deep brawler here, but when punches seemingly pass through enemies, something's up.  There are some technical problems in Shrek, too. Rumplestilskin isn't your only nemesis. The camera apparently hates Shrek and Donkey, too. The camera loves to get trapped in things or obstruct your view of the action. The action buttons are responsive, but moving is strangely tricky. Shrek falls not if you walk out into space, but if you just get too close to the edge. The virtual stick just felt clumsy. I don't recall falling off this many platforms in Gameloft's Assassin's Creed or Hero of Sparta. And I can definitely see this driving a younger player just crazy.  Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, and the bigger stars of the Shrek universe do not contribute here, but their sound-alikes are pretty darn close. The writing in Shrek is also good; there are many chuckles in here. The visuals, however, are a mixed bag. Shrek's hands are actually mitten and the way textures are wrapped around characters is all over the map. Shrek's face looks pretty good. But the Far, far Away's villagers? Er, not so much. ",

One minute you\u2019re just adding a tower and some windows to an old house, and suddenly you look up and you\u2019ve spent two hours building a sprawling village with ponds and crooked paths, your screenshots folder is bursting with images of your little masterpiece at dusk and dawn, and your back hurts because you never did get a proper chair for your home office. Its biggest flaw is that, as the name implies, there just isn't enough of it. To say I was \u201cplaying Tiny Glade\u201d arguably isn\u2019t even accurate. It\u2019s more like I was playing with it. You could call it a building sim, but it\u2019s more like a set of enchanted Lego bricks, or a much prettier Minecraft creative mode. You get a blank canvas of terrain and a small set of tools to build some houses, place water and plants, take photos, and\u2026 well, that\u2019s it. So if building freely and setting your own goals are not enough to keep your attention, know that Tiny Glade is not going to throw any armies of orcs at your scenic battlements, and no one actually lives here. Tiny Glade Review 11 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game!

As someone who has built a million dysfunctional settlements for games, at first I cocked an eyebrow at the limited customization options on offer. Towers and buildings, plants, ponds, and paths didn't seem like enough to keep me busy, but as I experimented the limitations let my brain forget about building something specific because the tools take care of details thoughtfully and delightfully. Dragging a path right up to a building meant a door popped up on the front; Placing windows next to each other changed them from a simple pane to a wide bay window. Ducks arrived at the pond I had made and sheep wandered through the open areas and then, at night, the little lamps I had placed gave off a soft glow. It's almost meditative, seeing tiny changes in the environment affect your creation, safe in the knowledge there's no better or \u201cbest\u201d way to do it, or anything you can put in place can't be taken away again with a quick click of the mouse. Doctors could probably prescribe it as part of anger management treatments - who can be mad when they're busy placing happy little trees? That's the sweet spot for Tiny Glade: a small slice of flow state to pamper your brain and make the real world seem very far away. \u201c Unfortunately, after a few building sessions, it felt like Tiny Glade had run out of surprises. The delightful procedurally generated details that were added as I built were feeling repetitive, and making a house blue or green or tall or small or built entirely over water \u2013 imagine the black mold \u2013 lost its charm. The same restrictions that allow everything to fit together so smoothly also mean that more creative types who want to experiment are going to have a very limited set of parameters to do that in. Building in different seasons, moving the clock forward to watch the lights come on in the windows, all of those tweaks can only maintain the thrill for so long. Covering a house all in lamps? Who cares, when you and your Steam screenshot folder are the only ones who will ever even notice, aside from the aforementioned sheep. There is at least a theme of the day that offers the gentlest of suggestions, setting a vibe and starting you off with a small hamlet for you to adapt. However, you're not getting graded on your work, so after a while the novelty of direction erodes like bad masonry. That said, after a few days\u2019 break I was back again, using it as the equivalent of a cerebral fidget toy in between cutting Tyranids in half. That's the sweet spot for Tiny Glade: a small slice of flow state to pamper your brain and make the real world seem very far away. Of course, on the internet the rule for anything is \u201cpics or it didn't happen,\u201d and Tiny Glade has met that challenge with a peachy-keen screenshot mode. It even has a first-person mode so you can explore your creation on foot, and see just how wrong you got the angles on that particular bit of garden wall from the perspective of a flying ghostly architect. I can absolutely see a world where hardcore fans trade screenshots, gently compete to out-cute each other, but I'll be keeping my adorable creations to myself, thank you very much. Still, having a way to preserve and play in the little sets I created is a nice touch, and I hope other games steal the screenshot toolset immediately for its clever mix of control and simplicity. Everything that's in Tiny Glade is a little spoonful of joy, from sheep to walled-in gardens to creating tall towers with a Rapunzel vibe, but it's a gaming snack. Go in expecting dozens of hours of gameplay and you'll burn through it after a few hours and call it a day. See it as an art package that you'll bring up when a creative mood strikes and you'll find a magical little toolset to get lost in. It may be small in stature, but Tiny Glade will live forever in my Steam library, ready to use its coziness to quell the darkness that lurks within my very soul."

        "Subtitle": "Just how bad can whacking a little ball with a stick get? Psygnosis will show you.",
        "Content": "There's nothing wrong with admitting you like to play golf on a game system. It's a very relaxing genre, and sometimes there's nothing more soothing than to kick back and play a round of 18. It's not exactly the real thing, but not everyone has the knack or patience to learn the perfect backswing. So, we rely on our good friend the PlayStation to give us The Next Best Thing. With games like Tiger Woods '99 or Hot Shots Golf, you can pretend you're the next pro-to-be and imagine that the winnings you've earned are real. Or not. Unfortunately, like every genre, there's bound to be a stinker of the bunch. And in the PlayStation's case, it comes from Psygnosis . Pro 18 World Tour Golf is one of the worst recreations of golf made on a game system, and there is nothing this package has that would entice you to boot the game up a second time. And when you've got great golf games like the PlayStation's Hot Shots Golf and Tiger Woods '99, there's absolutely no reason to pick up this game at all. Gameplay One thing going for Pro 18 is its options. It features three 18-hole courses: Royal County Down in Ireland, The Lost City Course in Sun City, South Africa, and Coeur d'Alene in Idaho. It also features a handful of well known pros from around the world, including Mark O'Meara and Colin Mongomerie, but you cannot play as them. You can also pick the type of weather you want to play in, from fog to rain, or simply play during a nice day. Like most golf games, Pro 18 features a click-interface for driving the ball. The first tap of the button sends the swing meter up the powerbar. Hitting the button a second time sets the power and brings the swing meter back down. A third click at the bottom of the swing determines how accurate the connection to the ball will be. But Pro 18 features one more meter that makes hitting the ball even more difficult. As soon as you hit the button a third time, the bottom green meter zips across so fast, you really don't know what to do. The idea is to release the button when the green bar meets the middle of the meter for the most accurate shot. If you don't time it correctly, the ball will slice or hook violently \u00bf and you really don't want that to happen. The interface is the game's major downfall. You have absolutely no idea how far a certain club will go until you use it. What's worse is that if you rotate the screen, there's no guide rule on the overhead map that shows you where you're pointing \u00bf due to the poor graphics engine, it's extremely hard to see where the pin is from a distance. And without any assistance it's a chore to play the game.  Graphics If the game uses a 3D engine, you'd never know it. The game is presented in \"slides.\" Want to turn your aiming? The game pauses for a second, then jerks to the left or right to alter the perspective. And when you drive the ball down the course, the camera changes its angle so the ball moves towards the viewer \u00bf but it's all in one step. There's barely any in-game animation to speak of. And the contrast between player and background is a little odd, since the course graphics are still, blocky textures, and the golfers are 30 frames-per-second FMV. When you combine the two, it's a mixture that just looks completely awkward.  Sound Pro 18 does have some voice-over commentary, but it's so subtle you'd barely even notice it. There are audio clips of birds and such, but again, it's not noticeable. If you wanted to crank down the audio track for more favorable music from an outside source, go right ahead. You won't be missing much. ",

As Thora, the battle-hardened viking warrior who unceremoniously drowns one stormy night at sea, you\u2019re given a second chance to prove your courage to the gods. And even while the larger story of a battle against elemental giants called Jotuns unfolds, Thora\u2019s backstory and stoic personality shine through in her narration, fantastically delivered in her strong voice and native language. Each themed level of the Jotun realms is spectacular, not only for the beautiful atmosphere, sweeping backdrops and vistas, and environmental dangers, but for the thoughtful inclusion of mythology ingrained in their design. Jotun is a slow experience, to be sure ... best appreciated and savored for its artistry. \u201c You\u2019ll engage lightning-pylon puzzles in the clouds to recreate constellations and connect sky bridges of light. You\u2019ll slide down the roots and climb the branches of Yggdrasil, the world-connecting tree. You\u2019ll travel through vignettes to learn the Norse myth of creation, and evade attacks from Jormungar, the colossal sea serpent that encircles the entire world. And though actually moving through these levels isn\u2019t particularly difficult, exploring them for hidden items like the life-bar extending Apples of Ithunn, braving the occasional enemy, and collecting the runes from each region never felt boring or unengaging. Jotun is a slow experience, to be sure, but its roughly 10 hours are best appreciated and savored for its artistry, rather than completed as quickly as possible. That is until you confront each realm\u2019s Jotun, where the priority becomes memorizing complex attack patterns in the erupting chaos of the colossal encounters. And they are colossal. Jotun\u2019s amazing use of scale successfully instills the feeling of insignificance against the hugeness of the Norse world. Defeating the titanic Jotuns is the fast-paced, action-heavy storm to the calm of exploration that precedes them. \u201c Defeating the titanic Jotuns is the fast-paced, action-heavy storm to the calm of exploration that precedes them.

Each encounter sparks a hectic dance of avoiding massive attacks while navigating environmental pitfalls. Picking the right moment to strike back is almost always a tough challenge.

        "Content": "As I drop out of hyperspace flight, the whine of my engines resonating throughout the cockpit of my Cobra Mk III spacecraft as they screech to a halt, a Methane Dwarf star stares back at me. The purplish light of the star bounces off the dashboard of my spacecraft, filling the area with a melancholy glow. This peaceful moment leaves me awestruck as I take it in, making me hesitant to move on to the next leg of my journey. Elite Dangerous is a game full of drastic swings between peaceful, poetic moments like this, others that are full of danger and action, and some of the most boring stretches of empty space I\u2019ve ever navigated. Though this deep and vast space fighter sim has been out (first on PC and then on Xbox One) for a few years now, Elite Dangerous has finally brought its 1:1 scale model recreation of our Milky Way Galaxy to the PlayStation 4. At least in this version of the 3rd millennium, this is a place rife with political intrigue, trading empires, space fighter combat - all separated by  tracts of empty light years.   Elite Dangerous can be played fully solo with just the stars to keep you company, or it can be played  online in its Open Play mode. The latter is a persistent online universe where you\u2019re constantly bumping into other players, known as Commanders, but interacting with other players is pretty limited. You can group up and run missions, trade routes, or simply explore together, but the vast majority of human interaction boils down to piracy and bounty hunting. It\u2019s up to you, Commander, to decide how to start. \u201c What\u2019s not easy, however, is learning how to play Elite Dangerous. The learning curve is tough, especially when it comes to piloting your craft or simply trying to figure out what the heck to do next. Sure, you start off with tutorials teaching everything from basic flight, combat situations, and even landing procedures (the bane of many commanders\u2019 experiences), though those can only go so far. Once you jump into the shared online universe for real, however, you\u2019re thrown into the cockpit of a basic Sidewinder spacecraft, in a space station, orbiting a planet in a random star system with no direction as to how to proceed. It\u2019s up to you, Commander, to decide how to start. I suggest searching YouTube for some starter guides, because otherwise Elite Dangerous risks blowing its precious first impression on its deep trading system, or even to learn more about the political struggles which hang over every corner of civilized space. This level of freedom is often teased in open-world games, but with Elite Dangerous it\u2019s fully realized. You can become a prolific trader, capitalizing on trade routes between stations and amassing millions of credits with each trip you take. If piracy is more your thing, more power to you: you can hunt down unsuspecting pilots, steal their cargo, and sell it to some shady dealer in a fringe system, risking bounty hunters in every flight. If you enjoy the solitude and simplicity of traveling light years beyond the borders of civilized space you can explore the unknown, bringing back cartography data of a far-off star no one has heard of before. Some will be content to simply stick to one role the whole time, but I realized early on that I was going to bounce between play styles depending on my mood. I found myself mostly specializing in trade with the occasional bounty hunting when the constant travel started to wear on me. Wisely, Elite Dangerous doesn\u2019t put any barriers in your way when you want to change things up.  Elite Dangerous becomes increasingly satisfying. \u201c There is no overarching campaign to complete, though there are political intrigues and storylines to be found in every starport. It's up to you how to shape these stories, good or bad. It\u2019s daunting, especially to those accustomed to a more focused space adventure like No Man\u2019s Sky - which is open world but had a defined goal to work towards at the end - or Wing Commander. But as each layer is peeled back, the gameplay of Elite Dangerous becomes increasingly satisfying, leaving me with the feeling that even the time spent traveling from one dot on my heads-up display (HUD) to another isn\u2019t entirely time wasted. I find it fulfilling to pore over trade data I\u2019ve logged, maximizing the route to take in order to make the most money off a trading haul. I also love to study the Galaxy Map \u2013 a dizzying display of systems, trade routes, and power struggles \u2013 in order to find potential conflict zones I can take part in. Some of these moments can be a challenge to enjoy, though, since the PlayStation 4 version suffers from some pretty crippling performance issues, even after the patch that cleaned up the frequent screen tearing. Most severely, framerates plummet when blasting into a busy star system or arriving at a large, complex space station. The latter causes further annoyance since these issues mess with the responsiveness of the controls, making landing safely (which is difficult under the best conditions) a struggle not against game mechanics, but input lag.  Learning how your ship handles in stressful situations can go a long way to surviving. \u201c It helps that Elite Dangerous is one of the most beautiful space games I\u2019ve played. The inside of each ship\u2019s cockpit is intricately detailed, with a level of care usually reserved for racing sims. Effects - such as the lessening of light pollution as you move away from a nearby star, making nebulae, stars and more become more visible as you continue to fly away - are subtle, but help to reinforce this convincing sense of place. Each spacecraft handles distinctly, from the quick and speedy Eagle to the slow and lumbering Hauler, and learning how your ship handles in stressful situations can go a long way to surviving in the long run. The biggest part of that is combat, which also feels great. Combat in Elite Dangerous isn\u2019t just a \u201cpoint and shoot\u201d affair. Each instance is different, bringing with it a bevy of on-the-fly decisions that can make the difference between winning and ejecting into cold space. One time I dropped into the system of Eravate and immediately headed to the Nav Beacon, and was greeted immediately with the sight of a group of players and AI ships alike engaged in a space battle with a poor soul sporting a pretty large bounty (which you build up through acts of piracy). I\u2019d upgraded my ship a few times since starting out, so I sent my Cobra Mk III into high gear to engage and collect a portion of the spoils. Soon I was staring down a large Anaconda-class ship and settled in for a bumpy fight.  My Cobra\u2019s hardpoints lashed out, sending beams across the enemy ship. His did, too, and my shields were gone in what felt like an instant. Shields gone, I had to figure out how to survive against this massive ship while staying in the fight. I kicked my throttle into gear and performed a quick-axis turn by turning flight assist off, keeping my eyes on the enemy while moving out of range of its weapons. Thankfully, a ship upgrade I made in the previous station meant my shields recharged faster, which allowed me to get right back into the fray. Throttle still fully engaged, I turned back on flight assist to stabilize my fighter as I set my ship's power to focus on its weapons, and gave it everything my beam weapons could. Its shields were now down, and with the Anaconda weakened I used my cannons and multi-guns to tear apart its hull \u2018till it met its demise. A bounty of 201K credits flashed across my heads-up display, ready to collect at the nearest starport. Even with all these moments in mind, though, it is hard to shake the fact that for much of your time spent in Elite Dangerous will be spent traveling in essentially a straight line - whether from port to port, system to system (or even planet to planet with the $30 Horizons DLC). It\u2019s easy to fall into a routine, but that routine largely becomes dull and uninviting. Thankfully, Elite Dangerous on PS4 launches with the Arena mode, giving a reprieve from the mundane moments of interstellar travel. The game modes in the CQC (or Close Quarters Combat) Arena are nothing to call home about when it comes to objectives: you can take part in either team or free-for-all deathmatch, or a capture the flag mode. But the constant action keeps me engaged. Within the Arena, there is a separate progression system: you\u2019re not bringing in your incredibly outfitted ships from the main game, but ranking up and unlocking new ships, weapons, and items to take into combat. Ranking up doesn\u2019t take too long either \u2013 within about five or six deathmatch rounds I found myself with a few unlocked ships and loadouts to rival some of the better fighters in the Milky Way, which left everything else to a test of pilot skill."

        "Content": "  Like those annoyingly persistent low-level enemies you have to beat down over and over again in a lengthy RPG, Altered Beast just keeps popping up. Every time it's re-released, we play it again. Every time, we're disappointed again. And every time we slap a low score on it, we bury it and leave it for dead, and it stays underground for a few more peaceful months.  Before it inevitably rises from its grave one more time.  Altered Beast is an arcade beat-'em-up from the late '80s that should have stayed there. But, instead, SEGA continually resurrects and re-releases it, making nearly countless plays for the same piece of the nostalgic audience that still hold some fond memories of its original coin-op edition.  In just this hardware generation alone, it's re-appeared four other times -- once on the PS3 through Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection , twice on Xbox 360 through that same compilation disc and a \"Vintage Collection\" Live Arcade release a few months ago, and, most offensively, already one time before on the Wii's Virtual Console. This is a review of the new edition of the game that's just appeared for download through the Wii Shop, but another version has already been on sale there since the system's launch in late 2006.  And, worse still, this new release adds an extra two bucks to the price tag.   Hadoken!  It might be easier to forgive Altered Beast's annoying persistence in trying to grab more of our money if it were a better game, actually worth the cash. But it's not. This side-scrolling brawler is a chore to play at best, with stiff and unresponsive control, repetitive level design and brutal difficulty that's based not on actual challenge offered by intelligent enemies, but imprecise hit detection and foes that will constantly take away huge chunks of your life bar (and your patience) without you being able to do anything to prevent it.  Its one redeeming feature, and the thing that gave rise to whatever positive childhood memories persist from its play, is that your lumbering, bumbling human hero can transform himself into a much more powerful beast creature in each stage. You can become a fireball-throwing wolfman, a lightning-shooting dragon, a cartwheeling bear and more. The animal forms are what you're constantly playing toward, and the game can actually be fun to play when you earn them -- but they're stripped away at the end of each level, which just starts the un-fun human sequences all over again.  Putting any pent-up aggression aside for a moment, though, this latest version of Altered Beast has to get some credit -- it's possibly the best version of the game to ever come along to a home console. (And that's saying something, given how many versions there've been.)  This is a Virtual Console Arcade release, and the games released under the VCA banner have been presented very well. With a variety of options available on an out-of-game setup menu, it allows you to adjust the number of lives you'll start with, change the health bar, toggle a rapid fire setting and more. The previous Altered Beast release to the Virtual Console was an emulation of the game's Genesis port, and featured none of these extras. So it could be argued that this version is superior, even though its price is two dollars more.",

It's a lot of little, subtle things\u2026 and a few not so subtle. Valheim PC Gameplay Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The art and world design are definitely near the top of that list. It has a deliberately lo-fi look with pixelated textures and not a lot of polygons to go around. But even so, it's truly a beautiful game. Every creature, sunbeam, and forested hillside is filled with a sort of fairy tale ambience that made me want to get lost in its procedurally-generated regions. And there's a lot to get lost in, from peaceful meadows to spooky, monster-infested woods to snowy mountains. Every time I generated a new map it impressed me with its scale and how it looked like it could\u2019ve been hand-made. Because of the naturalistic, Northern European feel, it comes across as very cohesive and authentic. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world opens up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. The first time Valheim really made me go \"Wow!\" was when, after about 15 hours of preparing, I set sail on my own hand-built ship. Like a proper viking, your main method of long-distance travel will be taking to the seas and riverways. The controls for steering are kind of clunky, and I love them for that very reason. Mastering the art of making tight turns, plotting a course through dangerous rapids, and managing my speed was oh so satisfying, even if it included some trial and error that did a number on my hull. By the time I had mastered the muscle memory to approach the shoreline at full speed and basically drift to a complete stop, parallel to the beach, right where I wanted to be, I felt like a true master of the briny deep. Realistic waves can bounce you up and down, and a sudden storm can even damage your vessel and force you to make for a safe harbor. The ever-changing direction of the wind is a constant consideration that may encourage you to go out of your way and discover something new rather than simply sail in a straight line. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world is opening up \u2013 and then it tries to eat you. Sometimes literally, as the deeper waters are full of danger. Dungeons and Dragons Valheim's larger monsters are very well designed in their simplicity. My first time encountering a troll was a memorable and terrifying experience. Some of my most exciting adventures arose simply from trying to figure out how to get from A to B without being smashed into jam. To reach the second boss arena, because of the way my world was generated, I had to sail up an extremely narrow river that ran between two frigid mountain biomes, which caused me to take constant damage from frostbite. Unfortunately, at the very coldest part of the canyon, I discovered the waterway actually became too narrow for my ship. I leapt out, the winter air chipping at my health bar, and frantically whacked away at the voxel rocks of the riverbed trying to make a canal wide enough to let me pass. And then, from the steep canyon walls above, a troll showed up and smashed my boat to flinders. I had to flee in terror, shivering in my soggy boots, return to my camp on foot (which involved spending a danger-filled night in the wilderness since it was so far away), build a new ship, come back, deal with the troll, finish my canal, and get on my way before I froze solid. None of that was scripted, but Valheim's simple but brilliant world generation made it one of the most memorable experiences I've had in any survival game in a long while \u2013 and it's far from the only tale I have like it! This is an ecosystem that consistently generates campfire-worthy stories with a small number of ingredients. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced. If you hadn't told me it was early access, I probably never would have suspected anything. You're out for your morning hunt and spot a troll. What do you do? Run awaaaaaaaaay! Row out in a boat and kill it with a bow while it can't reach. Square up and fight it head on. Lure it into a pit full of campfires and laugh as it burns. Answer See Results Some of those ingredients are better than others, of course. The nearly-ubiquitous Greydwarves of the Black Forest are an unchallenging annoyance, like flies you have to constantly swat away. I would have liked to snap my fingers and see maybe half of them deleted from existence. Unfortunately, I haven't found any magic space rocks for my gauntlet just yet. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced than this. On the other end of that spectrum are the satisfying, hectic, dramatic boss fights that drive Valheim's progression. These really demonstrate the strengths of its combat: There are five in this early access version, out of a planned nine, and I've taken on four of them in the 40-plus hours I've played so far. Not only do they serve as a climactic capstone to each area and tier of technology, they're really enjoyable and rewardingly difficult to defeat. Each is a major step up in challenge from the last, and the third and fourth bosses feel almost absurd to take on solo. Definitely plan to bring some backup and you\u2019ll have a much better time. The randomized dungeons are also a treat, from bone-strewn viking barrows that reminded me of Skyrim to foreboding crypts that bring to mind the undead areas of the original Dark Souls. You'll need a torch to navigate them, and they're full of monsters, treasure, and crafting materials that you can't get in the overworld. Each one is a nice little break from the sometimes tedious tasks you'd be doing above ground. Back to the Grind As with most survival crafting games, Valheim can get a bit grindy \u2013 sometimes extremely grindy, in fact. Harvesting enough ore or metal scraps to get a new set of gear can literally take real-world days. Some later areas require certain consumables, like poison or frost resistance mead, to even survive in them, meaning you have to do a lot of collecting and brewing every time you want to visit. This cuts both ways, because it serves to make them feel more thrilling and dangerous, but also adds a layer of ticking-clock anxiety and a lot of repetitive prep work to exploration as you watch your mead supply dwindle. Not being able to access a new area because I needed to get stronger to beat up a troll is cool. Not being able to access a new area because I'm waiting on my bees to make more honey? Not so much. Work faster, stupid bees! I really like the way other consumables tie into progression, though. While you can skill up in different weapons and abilities, like running and swimming, your health and stamina meters are completely tied to what's in your belly. This means that \"leveling up\" mostly involves finding new ingredients and learning new recipes to ensure you're always as well fed as you can be. Valheim also wants you to eat a balanced diet. You can benefit from up to three types of food at any time, but stacking more than one of the same thing gives you no benefit. This is really one of Valheim's most clever little tricks for making your character feel more alive and connected to the world, and it sets itself apart from the rote, old-fashioned RPG progression routines where experience translates to levels, which translate into more hit points and energy. There's something really satisfying and thematically appropriate about heading out to battle evil with a full stomach, a good night's rest, and a flagon full of invigorating mead to quaff. And it also avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems in other games: being hungry will never actually kill you or prevent you from being able to hunt and gather. You just won't want to go into battle with anything stronger than a skeleton on an empty stomach. Valheim avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems: it can't actually kill you. Building your own viking village can be a decent way to while away the hours while you wait for those bees. While Valheim is voxel-based, it's also much more limited in how much effect you can have on the terrain than something like Minecraft. You can raise and lower the terrain a certain amount, but it's not very precise. The tool for leveling out an area for building was especially unsatisfying to use, as I never seemed to be able to get a nice, even grade no matter how much I fiddled with it. That means all of my buildings were either floating partly above the ground, or the dirt below would clip through the floorboards in some places. Other than that, the structures you can build are cozy and appropriately Norse. They're assembled from a collection of pre-made pieces that limit your stylistic freedom somewhat, but also make sure the things you build really look like they belong in this world. When you move on to bigger projects, you even have to start thinking about support beams and load-bearing walls, which was a welcome little touch of immersion.

        "Content": "PlayStation VR Worlds seems like the demo disc that should\u2019ve been included with the PlayStation VR. Some of its five bundled games are great demonstrations of what the PlayStation VR can do, but the others are throwaways that I\u2019ll quickly forget I played. The star of the show is The London Heist. Aside from a brief puzzle scene in which you open a safe to steal a diamond, it\u2019s little more than a shooting gallery with the Move controllers. There's one scene about shooting your way out of a robbery gone wrong and another where you ride shotgun in the getaway car and blast away at pursuers. Shooting is simple, but the experience of firing a virtual gun with a Move controller is still a great novelty, and reloading by popping magazines into your gun with the other hand is satisfying. It's a little annoying that there's no ammo counter for your gun to warn you when you're running low, but that made me try to keep track of how many shots I'd fired and made it slightly less mindless. Simply shooting things is far more fun this way than it is with a traditional game controller, so I can forgive a lack of significant enemy or weapon variety. I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me. \u201c Surrounding the gunfights, The London Heist is dressed up with impressive cinematic monologs from a pair of highly detailed gangster characters. They\u2019re well acted and impressively animated as they argue and posture, and though I didn't have enough time to get attached to them as characters in the short running time I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me asking for a light for their cigar or threatening me in a subway service station. After the hour-long story\u2019s done there\u2019s a set of three shooting gallery levels with leaderboards to play on. Free of the need to make things fit into a serious story, these ranges have a lot more fun with the idea: they throw in elements like friendly targets and paint cans moving along tracks that you have to shoot at the right time to knock them into appropriately colored bins. There's some replay value in setting high scores on there, which is good, because that's about all the replay value that PlayStation VR Worlds has to offer. Scavengers Odyssey, for instance, is a short and linear first-person shooter where you use the DualShock 4 to pilot a mech suit through a story of uninteresting sci-fi mysticism. Enemy variety is weak \u2013 only three aliens, counting the final boss, and a stationary turret \u2013 and there are only two weapons including a gravity gun, so combat is bland. The best thing about it is launching yourself between platforms, which I enjoyed for the sensation of movement as you trigger a leap to a pre-designated spot, and for the ability to double-jump and change directions mid-air. But it\u2019s over in less than two hours, and there\u2019s no reason I\u2019d want to play it again. More PlayStation VR Launch Reviews  See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents, Danger Ball will be short-lived. \u201c Danger Ball is basically first-person Pong for the VR era, and controlling your paddle by looking where you want it to go works great. This is the kind of game that can only really work with stereoscopic 3D, because you need to be able to tell how far away the incoming ball is, and the PlayStation VR handles that well. I was able to time the impact well enough to do a last-second flick of my head to put some English on the ball and make it curve in a direction of my choosing, which often threw off the AI player and scored an easy point. The different opponents do shake things up with unique powers, such as being able to launch two balls at you at once or a shield you need to break down before you can get it by them. However, they're not too bright, and it only took a couple of tries to beat the tournament mode. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents directly instead of just through the leaderboard on the simple score-chase mode, this one will be short-lived. VR Luge is about as simple and arcadey as you can get. You're put in the perspective of a luge racer coasting down busy streets, dodging cars by looking right and left. I think the biggest disappointment, besides the fact that head-on collisions with trucks barely slow you down, is that I didn't get as much of a sense of speed as I'd expected from being inches off the ground and allegedly moving at over 100 miles per hour. There\u2019s some scenery and spectacle, but not much gameplay variety - you\u2019re just dodging left and right using your head. Ocean Descent isn\u2019t a game, but an interesting passive experience in which you\u2019re lowered hundreds of feet into the ocean in shark-proof cage. There\u2019s some beautifully animated sea life and a little drama created by your crew on the radio, and it made me flinch a few times, but not much more than that. When you're done you can take the same trip again without the excitement or just sit underwater and watch the fish swim, but that would've been much more relaxing and meditative if there were an option to remove the ugly shark cage."

        "Title": "Goat Simulator Review",
        "Subtitle": "Funny Farm",
        "Content": "Goat Simulator is a joke of a game. It\u2019s small, deliberately unpolished and buggy, and its design is simple. So it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor, and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map. There\u2019s not much actual gameplay here beyond breaking things for points, but shooting for a high score is probably the least entertaining thing about Goat Simulator. It\u2019s mostly about exploring the fun house and discovering the hilarious surprises at your own pace. There\u2019s no story to explain why we\u2019re a goat or what\u2019s filled his heart with such murderous hatred, but the one that developed for me is an absurdist tale of an invincible creature terrorizing a rural community. It\u2019s a sequence of weird and random events, like when I snagged a hapless bystander with my impossibly stretchy goat tongue, climbed a huge crane with my horrible ladder-climbing animation, then leaped from the top with my dangling captive in tow. I tapped Q to enable the rag-doll physics and F to activate slow motion so I could enjoy the goofy flailing of my goat and his unwilling passenger to its fullest. There\u2019s always something delightful about watching the goat collapse in a heap on impact, then magically shaking it off as though nothing happened. Or, even better, watching him immediately get hit by a car. Mission goals are presented as optional achievements, which range from goofy little things like pushing the 1 key several times to hear all the different goat noises to seeing how long you can remain airborne, or high-score challenges that give an extra reason to run around like a goat in a china shop (as if we needed one). Plenty of collectibles are stashed around the map, and grabbing that stuff unlocks a few great alternate models. Still more interesting are the unannounced goals, like tipping a \u201cGiant Death Boulder\u201d positioned on a hill above a barbeque party, stumbling into the secret goat kingdom and gaining magical powers, or finding the awesome and completely uncontrollable jetpack. Exaggerated physics are used to great effect in most of these \u2013 it\u2019s hilarious to kick over a dining room table and send everything flying (including the dinner guests), then have a random plate or piece of fruit fly out the window with enough force to cause a nearby car to explode. I love how much of the world is destructible, but it\u2019s also a little disappointing that big stuff like buildings can\u2019t be knocked down and certain scripted cars aren\u2019t affected by your interactions. Surprisingly nice lighting and shadows aside, everything looks very plain and undetailed, as though the art was designed for a different game altogether (which is entirely possible). That just makes the goat\u2019s outlandish behavior feel even funnier \u2013 like he\u2019s wrecking someone else\u2019s game. As advertised, Goat Simulator is buggy as all hell. Expect to see lots of clipping problems as people get stuck in walls, and to have to use the respawn menu command every so often when you get stuck in objects or fall through the world. Developer Coffee Stain has vowed never to fix these (except for crash bugs, which I haven\u2019t seen any of) because they think they\u2019re funny, and for the most part they\u2019re absolutely right about that. The fact that you can never die or fail in any way means that there\u2019s nothing to lose from those bugs, and everything to gain when something tremendously unlikely results from them. It'll only get more insane over time, as the Steam Workshop support allows us to easily add the mods that are already trickling out of the community. (I like the wiggling goat legs.)",

        "Title": "Aquarium Review",
        "Subtitle": "No dolphins, no sale.",
        "Content": "Hey, so remember when I said Fantasy Aquarium was one of the worst, most useless games ever made? I neglected to inform you all that the developer, Ertain , made a companion game. Aquarium is just like its fantasy brother, only without the fantasy. It's still a pointless title that is closer to a screen saver than a game, but now it's got fishies instead of dolphins. On one hand you expect fish to be boring, on the other hand, you can't even make them fake-eat each other.  The main goal of Aquarium is to, I don't know, make the fish happy? The developers never seemed to bother to create objectives. I examined the instruction booklet and still couldn't figure out what I'm doing with five tanks and various tropical fish.  Saying Aquarium is casual implies that it holds some appeal towards the casual gamer market. I'd say the game is more catatonic than casual. At least the Fantasy Aquarium had killer whales and penguins and crap. This has regular fish. All the animals in Aquarium behave like any other boring Wal-Mart fish. I know, that's how fish are, but why would I buy a video game to simulate something as boring as fish? They don't even react when I tap on their tank. Of course they don't have much to react to. Really the only thing I was able to do to my fishes was drop food in their tank. Then I got to watch in rapt fascination as my pets did nothing at all and the food just magically disappeared.  There are no points in Aquarium. No money to buy stuff with. You can buy as many lionfish as you want, then let them all die and just buy some more. The big pay off is just watching the fish swim back and forth while you listen to tedious, ocean inspired music that you might find on a bargain CD in a real aquarium's gift shop. It's supposed to be relaxing, but the music is grating and the tank really bland. There's a decoration option, but that made things worse.   Trust me, it's barely more exciting when they're moving. To make this painfully dull experience more fun I utilized the tank customization tool. From there players are able to decorate their tanks to make them more pleasant. The problem is that everything in the game is so hideous that the tank always looks tacky. The coral and stone arch decorations might be kind of cool if they were just flat, pixilated clip art. Worse yet, the fish pass right through the objects. The tank's wall and background can be tiled with neon colors or weird, clashing wallpaper. It just ends up making the whale and dolphin tanks look like they're located on the Vegas strip. And not the nice section of the strip either. More like down by Circus Circus.  There are numerous aquatic creatures to unlock, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. Somehow I did stuff that made new fish appear in the selection screen. Of course the only fish I had ever heard of (Clown Fish, Lion Fish, Angel Fish, that fish that Dory was in Finding Nemo...) are already unlocked from the start, and there isn't room to have a lot of animals anyway.",

        "Content": "Perhaps the best compliment I can give Sky: Children of the Light is to say that I almost totally forgot I was playing a mobile game. Everything about this exploration-focused game, from the evocative visual style and soaring musical score to the intimate moments of subtle interaction with other nameless, speechless players, is pure bliss. It should give you some idea of what type of game Sky is to hear that it\u2019s the latest from thatgamecompany, the visionary studio behind low-key, critically-acclaimed games Flow, Flower, and Journey, the latter of which won IGN\u2019s Game of the Year award for 2012 . Sky isn\u2019t a direct sequel to Journey, but it might as well be: the characters move with that same elegant grace as their capes flutter behind them and it features an expanded and more engaging multiplayer component. Your quest to relieve lingering spirits, which are suspended as translucent silhouettes across various worlds, is a charming story about healing and restoration that\u2019s almost meditative to play. It\u2019s emotional and beautiful in a way few games are and really shows why thatgamecompany is a master of this particular craft. Sky is a game about discovery in more ways than just its world. \u201c Tutorials teach you how to do things like move around with the floaty and sometimes obtuse on-screen virtual joystick controls, jump by tapping your right thumb, and soar through the clouds by holding it down, but Sky is a game about discovery in more ways than just its world. For example, there are nuances to movement you can pick up as you play. If you time your jumps just right to hop immediately after landing the previous jump, you pick up speed while skipping across fields and meadows. Or if you land a jump on the downward side of a hill, you\u2019ll skate across the ground at higher speeds. Learning those unnecessary but useful techniques gives it a sense of progression even though you\u2019re not mechanically unlocking new abilities. Similar to Journey, Sky offers an almost unrivaled sense of freedom, specifically because of its simplicity. Detailed guidance on where to go or what to do generally isn\u2019t needed because exploring the open and inviting worlds and intuitively finding things on your own is basically the entire game, but naturally it can also be a bit unclear where to go at times. If the subtle storytelling wasn\u2019t as delightful to watch. Large creatures appear in between worlds to offer a Shadow of the Colossus-esque emotional weight to everything. The sounds they make sound are desperate and painful, while your character and the spirits you discover are more melodic and cheery in tone. And arguably, meeting and playing with others is just as important to the story as the minimalist cutscenes themselves. Plus, interactions with other players are so responsive and fun that the simple format doesn\u2019t grow tiresome. Instead, it actually felt like the shackles of a guided tutorial and restricted level designs are removed by the time you reach the second world, about 15 minutes in. Each of the seven different landscapes has a personality of its own, from the ethereal and cloud-heavy worlds full of floating islands to those covered in dense, green grass inviting you to skate across the prairies, or even forests drenched in rain that evoke a somber yet comforting atmosphere. 74 Images But what puts Sky over the top is how much it embraces its wonderfully positive social interactions. There\u2019s no voice or text chat and no way to directly communicate with other players \u2013 instead, you use a collection of quaint and frankly heartwarming gestures. You can hold out a candle to greet and add a player to your friend list and then assign them a custom nickname (since you can\u2019t see their actual name). You can play music together, exchange glowing butterflies, and even hold hands to go exploring as a team. Up to eight players can join hands led by a single leader that guides the group across the land and through the sky. The impromptu grouping system feels genuine because of the emotive interactions characters make towards each other and it\u2019s a great system to help new players figure out what to do and where to go. It\u2019s a bit like putting yourself on autopilot while someone else guides the way, but you can easily break off whenever you want to resume control. The unspoken communication in multiplayer is a big part of the magic and is best with a stranger. \u201c Technically, you can invite friends directly to play with people you know, but much like Sky as a whole, the unspoken communication in its multiplayer is a big part of the magic and is best with a stranger. One player I met (who I decided to name \u201cHomie\u201d) explored with me for over an hour. Sometimes we\u2019d stop and just sing to each other by tapping our avatars directly or we\u2019d hop across fields, skating and racing against each other. At one point Homie grabbed my hand and flew us both through the sky, swirling and weaving between the clouds. At no point was I concerned with \u201cwhat to do next\u201d \u2013 I just enjoyed the spectacle. It was simple and wonderful. Sky is as complex as you want it to be. The entire game is completable from start to finish entirely solo, but several hidden doors and secret side areas can only be unlocked if multiple players gather together to solve simple puzzles, like lighting two candles at the same time. On the surface, these puzzles are often as simple as tapping on a candle to light it up or following a trail of glittering dust to the next spirit silhouette, but there\u2019s a satisfying magic in every interaction. Story events aren\u2019t explicitly explained, but you can put the pieces together based on the environments and poses of each silhouette you encounter. Many scenarios are heartbreaking, featuring characters buckled over in grief, and that makes your relieving touch to dissipate the spirit all the more powerful. Visually, it\u2019s breathtaking from start to finish and even though you\u2019re just lightly tapping on the screen and watching the environment bursting with light, it\u2019s hard not to feel at ease. While I loved every minute of Sky on an iPhone, I couldn\u2019t help but yearn for a more capable gaming system. The on-screen controls do a respectable job while exploring, but when you need precision and subtle movements for platforming segments or when guiding another player around the world, the lack of actual buttons and control sticks got in the way a bit. Thankfully, the forgiving and welcoming design meant minor annoyances like floaty controls rarely interrupted the fun. In some regards, Sky\u2019s focus on deeper gameplay robs it of a bit of the charm that made Journey\u2019s elegant simplicity so special the first time around, but that\u2019s often the case with follow-ups and spiritual successors. Instead of trying to replicate its predecessor, thatgamecompany has instead iterated and expanded upon what came before to craft an adventure that\u2019s strange, meditative, and memorable. The mysterious ending, which I reached after about four hours, invites repeat playthroughs and the dynamic multiplayer encounters ensure no two runs will ever be the same.   Microtransaction Reaction While it\u2019s a free download from the Apple App Store, I played through the entirety of Sky without spending a dime, and I never felt the need to. But if you\u2019d like, you can pay for microtransactions to speed up your access to the in-game currency that lets you buy customization items like alternate hair, capes, and clothing designs, or even upgrading in-game emotes. It\u2019s a simple system that works well and riffs off of the rest of Sky\u2019s simplicity in a rewarding way."
