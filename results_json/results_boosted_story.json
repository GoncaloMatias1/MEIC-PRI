        "Content": "Continue?9876543210 is a game about symbolism and death. This isn't unique, as virtually every videogame makes heavy use of symbols \u2013 a red cross symbolizes health; a block of buildings with a star represents a capital city. What makes Continue? unique is that it embraces and understands the symbolism of games and abstract narrative, and constructs its story entirely around that understanding. The actual game side of Continue? occasionally interferes with the overall experience, but it is fascinating. Symbolic storytelling works because our brains fill in the blanks automatically when given incomplete information in every story. But when it's especially abstract, as Continue? is, the ambiguity is riskier. Its character design shows how this works: the piles of tiny blocks and stilted limbs approximate a human just well enough to represent most any videogame hero, without actually looking like any in particular. With every one of its components \u2013 visual style, dialogue, plot, music, and even styles of gameplay \u2013 Continue? creates an ambiguity using symbols, that works very well for it. The most immediate symbol is Continue?9876543210's title, a reference to the countdown encouraging you to put in more quarters in arcade games. (Back when those were a thing.) It's not common or necessary anymore, but it immediately points to death. That's the first thing you see starting it up: the main character keels over in a forest, and the Continue? countdown begins. This is followed by a touching and clever introduction showing a mixture of religious death imagery \u2013 going into the light, crossing the River Styx \u2013 with programming, like a set of .jsp \u201cfiles\u201d connected to the hero's limbs suddenly turning to \u201cnull.\u201d That mixture of the practical elements of the program with the metaphysical symbols of death and afterlife remains one of Continue?'s strongest aspects throughout. Your hero is unwilling to be erased, and is swept up by a program that cleans garbage from his \u201cgame's\u201d memory. So he or she moves through limbo, talking with people, figuring out a way to avoid the \u201cgarbage collector\u201d program. It all sounds very artsy, but there's a challenge behind it too: you have to play through six random levels, collecting \u201cshelter\u201d against a gathering storm, while also fighting off enemies trying to devour your \u201cRAM\u201d in arcade-style minigames based on Zelda or Space Invaders. The controls for these are too awkward for them to be the reason to play Continue? on their own, but they work in this context as an abstract meditation on videogame death \u2013 they're awkward and abstract in the same way that the characters are visually. Unlike similarly themed games (To The Moon, for example, which uses the structure of a game to tell an easily accessed story,) Continue? is challenging to complete, especially on the first run. Its overall structure of racing for shelter against deletion creates an interesting balance of time, resources, and future planning. But explaining all of that takes away from Continue?'s primary charm, which is its symbolic mystery. Much like 2012's Dear Esther or Journey, a huge amount of the \u201cgame\u201d is attempting to figure out what it\u2019s all about. For example, it uses the refrain of \u201cMy Lightning, My Prayer\u201d both as a core gameplay decision and a poetic contemplation on finding meaning in death. Death, when jsp files turn to null The writing continues in this vein. One of the first characters encountered explains that the software deletions have taken out chunks of language, making all the characters speak a broken English that veers between baby talk and poetry. Once again, this imbues Continue? with abstract meaning \u2013 whatever your brain thinks gives the symbolic dialogue the most meaning will work. On the other hand, the combination of the broken English with some of the level settings, like \u201cSlums\u201d or \u201cPrison,\u201d occasionally led me to the feeling that it\u2019s accidentally making fun of poor folk and minorities. (Likewise, one level that partially frames Juggalos as modern Native Americans due to tribal facepaint, shared songs, and ritual drinks doesn't work well.) If this sounds like Continue?9876543210 is a difficult game to grasp, that's because it is. Two components really define its core tension. First, its music glues Continue? together. Its sad, minor-key piano music for the directly death-related scenes may be a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it works well enough. It also nails the pounding danger of the battle sequences, as well as the desperate drone of the shelter levels. The artistic aspect of a game like this relies so much on mood, and the music consistently sets that mood in a way that supports the blocky graphics, broken/poetic English, and clumsy controls. My brother is also named Bort. On the other hand, the fact that there is a difficult game within Continue? serves to break that mood more than anything else. It can successfully instill a feeling of pensiveness about death in a cutscene between levels, but when you're more focused in making sure you have shelter and health, that cutscene or that poetic line of dialogue becomes an annoyance. The feeling of frustration that it sometimes instills trumps the feeling of sadness that it wants to consistently creates. In doing so, Continue?9876543210 inadvertently reveals why many games that take on difficult or emotional subjects tend to be \u201ceasy\u201d to finish: because that's the most effective way to convey the intended experience."

        "Title": "Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty Review",
        "Subtitle": "A good add-on that doesn't quite live up to expectations.",
        "Content": "When the credits rolled at the end of Borderlands 2, I knew I loved it. Its exceptional writing, fun combat, constant stream of loot, fun quests and the sense of place sucked me into Pandora for hours and left me hankering for more story content. Now that we finally have more, though, in the form of Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate\u2019s Booty, it\u2019s obvious the original campaign set a high bar that\u2019ll be tough to clear. Pirate\u2019s Booty provides hours of fun for people longing for more Borderlands 2 gameplay, but the story, characters and quests feel flat compared to the core campaign. As soon as you hit level 15 you can instantly fast travel to Oasis, the starting point for the Pirate\u2019s Booty content. Doing so triggers an awesome cinematic intro where you learn about a long-lost treasure. You\u2019ll also meet Captain Scarlett, a sand pirate who you\u2019ll help in an epic quest to uncover a host of loot. The story starts off great, with hilarious and well-written characters like Shade, but quickly stumbles into mediocrity. A few quests for Shade and you basically never see him again, leaving you with a slew of other characters which, despite having occasionally witty or charming dialogue, largely never come all that close to being as engrossing or great as I\u2019ve come to expect from Borderlands. Likewise the narrative just doesn\u2019t develop into anything especially good. Captain\u2019s Booty doesn\u2019t have a lead protagonist or antagonist binding it together in the way, Handsome Jack, Angel or Lilith do in the mainline story. As such it suffers, resulting in a story that\u2019s almost entirely predictable (and at times downright boring). Archetypal stories don\u2019t need to be boring (see Star Wars, Lord of the Rings), but Captain\u2019s Booty doesn\u2019t have interesting enough characters or plot twists to make it engrossing. That being said, the last part of Pirate\u2019s Booty is almost enough to redeem it, as the final zones\u2019 story and loot payoff makes the experience feel rewarding. If all you want is a reason to get more loot, levels (assuming you haven\u2019t maxed out), and to shoot your way through more of Pandora, Captain\u2019s Booty mostly succeeds. Combat encounters remain interesting and fun despite mostly putting you up against re-skinned enemies in pirate get ups, if only because your characters abilities and weapons feel like playing with toys. The occasional unique enemy like the Anchorman helps mix things up, as his ability to yank you to him from far away kills camping strategies. I think it\u2019s good to establish a sense of place, something the DLC does as well as the original campaign with its visual design, but it\u2019d be nice to see more creativity taken with the pirate theme than just putting a captain\u2019s hat or cutlass on the host of familiar foes. Likewise there\u2019s plenty of loot to collect and quests to fulfill, though the latter doesn\u2019t live up to the quality established by core Borderlands 2 experience. You won\u2019t find any weapons or other gear in the main quest that\u2019ll blow you away, but new level 50 raid bosses, including one you can kill for a new currency called Seraph Crystals, give the most dedicated of us something to chase long after the many hours of Pirate\u2019s Booty quests run out. Not that most of the quests are particularly interesting \u2013 most of them boil down to typical MMO-like fetch and kill quests. The main campaign of Borderlands 2 had its fair share of these objectives as well, but they were peppered throughout a lengthy narrative that also had a large number of inventive and inspired quests, even better writing and a slew of fantastic characters. If you\u2019re susceptible to the more typical and generically structured quests (and I\u2019ll admit, I am), then you\u2019ll find plenty to get sucked into, even if it\u2019s a bit boring and makes you retread environments a lot more when compared to what we\u2019ve seen before.",

It manages to pull together some of the best elements of the comic books, the Guardians film adaptations, and Telltale\u2019s ability to deploy well-paced and witty comedy with just enough interactivity to make you feel like a part of the action. Like Telltale\u2019s recent Batman game, this version of the Guardians doesn\u2019t seem to be ripped directly from either the comics or the movies but is rather a respectful pastiche that skews heavily toward the latter. Rocket, Groot, and Drax are almost indistinguishable from their cinematic incarnations, while Peter Quill, Gamora, and Yondu (the blue guy with the big red mohawk-thing on his head) incorporate a lot more traits from their paper-and-ink equivalents. There are also lots of small, clever easter eggs to find for devoted comics fans, which I definitely appreciated. The voice acting is applause-worthy, especially Nolan North as Rocket. Despite North\u2019s voice being heard in just about every video game ever, he turns it into something so energetic and over the top here that I wouldn\u2019t have known it was him if I hadn\u2019t been told ahead of time. It's a spot-on replication of Bradley Cooper\u2019s endearing and memorable performance from the film. Scott Porter\u2019s version of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, the primary hero, is a little lighter on the quippy delivery than Chris Pratt but brings a relatable, emotional depth to the character that fills in the gaps. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown early in the episode is a major highlight.Guardians\u2019 gameplay doesn\u2019t stray too far outside the Telltale formula we\u2019ve come to expect, with only minor but welcome additions like Peter\u2019s rocket boots allowing vertical exploration in some areas. There are semi-tedious detective segments where you wander around looking for the right thing to click on that make me long for the more difficult, puzzle-focused challenges of adventure games past. There are quippy, well-paced conversations with timed dialogue that affect various characters\u2019 impressions of you. And then there are the extended quick-time events which, while they don\u2019t involve any twists beyond hitting buttons really quickly at the right time, are some of the best Telltale has put together, presentation-wise. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown with one of Marvel\u2019s most iconic supervillains early in the episode is a major highlight. You get the joy of controlling each of the guardians and their unique abilities in an alternating fashion, becoming part of an exciting, well-choreographed brawl that looks like it could have come right off the pages of a comic. When Drax\u2019s fists aren\u2019t flying, and Rocket isn\u2019t pointing a firearm three times his size at anything that moves, Peter is forced to step in (with your guidance) to hold a group of big personalities together through a time that calls into question what their place in the galaxy really is. It\u2019s impossible to keep everyone happy all the time, and some of your friends will be almost literally at each other\u2019s throats by the episode\u2019s end, forcing you to take a side. We\u2019ll have to see how impactful these choices end up being in later episodes \u2013 it says Rocket will remember that I didn\u2019t want to do his crazy, dumb plan, but it\u2019s entirely possible everyone will be singing Kumbaya when the credits roll no matter how poor a leader I was. That would be unfortunate in terms of making our choices matter within the story, but for now at least Telltale has done a good job of making these decisions feel important and causing me plenty of enjoyable stress from trying to step up and do what a captain\u2019s gotta do amidst all the intra-team drama. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands.That mood is kept light by Guardians\u2019 comic relief. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands. There are at least a couple moments I laughed out loud at, and most of the dialogue writing is as clever and satisfying as the music choices, which delightfully echo the soundtrack of feelgood classic rock director James Gunn put together for the Guardians movies. Where the writing chops behind the episode really show, though, is in the more emotional and character-driven scenes. Intimate conversations between long-time friends experiencing big changes are authentic and moving. Particularly, a flashback scene between a young Peter and his mother felt all too real, injecting a grounded, well-executed B-plot about a kid who\u2019s still not over losing a parent into the swashbuckling space opera. One of my only other disappointments was how quickly it seemed like Tangled Up in Blue came and went. The bombastic, action-movie pacing worked well in some ways, but also prevented me from feeling like I really got to settle into and experience the world Telltale created as much as I did in the pilots for their take on Game of Thrones or any of the Walking Dead seasons. I look forward to returning and seeing the continued aftershocks of the multiple, major plot stingers (which are worth not spoiling for yourself!) as I chill with a likable, ably written and acted cast in future installments."

        "id": "042f463af1a5ab25e9106bfe6d84abe4",
        "Content": "Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII takes the kitchen-sink approach in its attempt to cap off Square\u2019s trilogy on a strong note. It wisely throws away the battle system and locations of the previous games in favor of fresh and more interesting mechanics and settings. It also presents a slew of new ideas to the series that call back to everything from classic JRPGs to Skyrim and Majora\u2019s Mask, and even Assassin\u2019s Creed. But in its attempt to kick things up for the final act, Lightning Returns stumbles in its storytelling. Instead of going out with a bang, it sadly ends the trilogy with an muddled and tonally inconsistent whimper.  The best thing about my 30-hour odyssey with Lightning is its refreshing new take on the battle system. Any fears I had that having only one party member and a newfound emphasis on action would diminish the experience were completely gone in the first 30 minutes. Though Lightning stands alone front and center in most fights, Square wisely captures the spirit of classic RPGs by allowing you to equip and customize a trio of Schemata, which each act like a different party member. Each form has its own unique look, attacks, and ATB meter, all of which are incredibly customizable.   Every hour or so I\u2019d find myself sifting through my new loot, creating new Schemata, and experimenting with all sorts of different combinations of roles. As someone who loves tweaking minutia and comparing stats, Lightning Returns did a great job of empowering me to create a battle trio that felt unique and personal.  But despite great battles, they're arguably less important than they've ever been in the series. You don't earn XP and level up through combat, only by completing quests. These range from story-based encounters with classic characters, to countless boring fetch-quests that make me feel like I was stuck in the opening hours of an MMO. If a quest's goal wasn\u2019t combat-related, I found myself avoiding combat, the thing I enjoyed most about Lightning Returns, in favor of making a beeline for the goal that would level me up faster.  The monotony of many of these objectives is counteracted partially by just how visually interesting and varied everything is. Lightning Returns almost immediately lets you off the leash and lets you visit pretty much any of the great-looking and varied locations in the entire world. There are sprawling deserts filled with monsters that will squash low-level characters; Lush greenlands rife for exploration on Chocobo-back; and massive cities brimming with life in the midst of an End of the World party. The world cycles through day and night, and the environments genuinely feel different at different times of the day. Streets are filled with shopkeepers during the day, stronger enemies appear at night, and certain quests can only be discovered close to dawn. There's a sense of urgency in the world of Lightning Returns that I really enjoy.   Sadly, the urgency of the world doesn't quite transfer over to the characters themselves. Lightning has always been a rather stoic cypher, but this time around she\u2019s downright unlikable. Her religious crusade has caused her to lose touch with humanity, which is evident through her interactions with other characters on both a narrative and technical level. The writing for main story quests is drenched in uninteresting pathos that failed to give me a reason to care about these characters that I\u2019ve spent well over 100 hours with. Lightning\u2019s trip around the world tries to provide closure to every single one of her prior relationships, but fails to do any of it in an interesting or rewarding manner.  It generally follows this pattern: you meet an old friend who\u2019s become evil for some reason or another, either fight them or complete a fetch quest in their honor, and then kiss and make up. Any life or levity that once existed in characters like Snow or Sazh is nowhere to be found. Lightning Returns seems to have forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place. What\u2019s even worse is that most of the many hours of dialogue are technically flawed in their staging and editing. Characters are often seen facing away from the person they\u2019re talking to, back and forths feel disjointed, and every NPC feels like they got dressed in the dark. The levity here is found in ample side quests such as this. Sadly, most of Lightning Returns\u2019 attempts at humor or anything light-spirited fall flat and just come off as weird. There\u2019s also a really strange disconnect between the randomness of the side quests and the emotional desolation of the main story that makes the act of playing feel sort of jarring. I guess it makes sense when you factor in how different each part of the trilogy feels compared to the others, but I was never able to quite grasp what tone Lightning Returns was going for."

        "Content": "Wild ARMs XF (pronounced \"Cross Fire\") is the next member of the subtly-loved RPG franchise, bringing the series into a fully strategic RPG dynamic -- similar to the gameplay you might find in titles like Final Fantasy Tactics. This hex-based title brings a few enjoyable elements to the table but is ultimately riddled with gameplay issues and thematic problems that rob XF of higher praise.  XF follows the story of Clarissa Arwin and Felius Arwin as they attempt to reclaim Clarissa's mother's sword from a troublesome Drifter named Rupert. Their humble quest obviously expands into a much greater story involving an entire kingdom and political upset. Clarissa comes across a number of different characters during her journey and a text heavy plot plays out as the game progresses.   The game is structured in a straight-forward manner and will be recognizable to fans of RPGs. Story sequences move the narrative forward and are punctuated by traveling and battles. You move across a 2D world map with small dots representing both towns and battlefields. While you can enter towns to talk with villagers, buy supplies and hire Drifters to work for you (though only through a list of options -- towns aren't rendered in any way, they're just static images), most of the action happens on the battlefield.  Everything in XF is dictated by precise hex movements and turn-based actions, just like Final Fantasy Tactics. After placing your party on the 3D map, each character has a turn to move and execute commands and the process repeats until particular objectives are fulfilled (or you lose). Battle is also heavily influenced by character classes, which range from magic users, close-range warriors and specialized classes with specific purposes, like dealing with the undead. Unfortunately, most of XF's problems come from the battle system, but we'll get to that in a moment.   Felius to the rescue. As I mentioned above, XF has a number of positive elements to consider. The first thing that comes to mind, surprisingly, is the sound. The Western-themed soundtrack is extremely enjoyable, though it may grow repetitious to some due to the small number of tracks versus the game's total play time, which is extensive. Regardless, the title's voice-over options are admirable, giving users the option of selecting either the original Japanese language track or the English dub. I opted for the Japanese track and was greatly satisfied with the quality of the voice work. The English track sounded... regrettable.  I was also rather impressed with the game's writing. While I can't necessarily speak on the quality of the translation, I will say that the dialogue was decidedly sharp and clever, which is definitely a plus for such a text-heavy title. Some of the characters have some genuinely great personality quirks, Labyrinthia being my personal favorite. But that's not to say the overall story is great -- I wasn't particularly enthralled by the narrative and it seemed pretty standard.  So now: the real problems.  A startling number of the battles in XF are objective-based and require very specific, very unforgiving methods of approach. This issue is easily my greatest problem with the game as a whole, because battles became a matter of extreme trial-and-error. If you don't have the exact classes for the task at hand, you'll usually fail and that means a lot of wasted time. The immense joy of strategy RPGs for me comes from delving into each and every class and exploring how best to use them, outfitting your party with the right members to provide the maximum reward. But XF essentially demands that you approach things a certain way, making a typically creative gameplay type into a linear one.   And while the game attempts to give you control by allowing your characters to switch class at any time (assuming you're not currently in a battle), the resulting gameplay just feels aggravating. When I originally played Final Fantasy Tactics, I would switch classes from time to time, but a great deal of fun came from mastering a class and relying on that one character for very specific purposes. But in XF you have to switch most of your classes for every battle and it makes the game feel like class has no permanence or weight.  More troubling is the fact that some of the objective-based battles are infuriating. For example, an early battle in the game gives you six characters to defend an entire row of hexes from enemy penetration. If a single opponent steps on that side of the map, you instantly lose. Worse still is that every member of the opposing side belongs to a class with nearly unlimited movement range, and they have a force twice as large as your own. I wasted hours trying to best this battle, where a single mistake would let one guy through and ruin your previous twenty minutes of play time. It was absurd.   The problems don't end there. As I mentioned in previous coverage of the game, each of your characters has a VP, or Vitality Points gauge that drops as you perform actions (even waiting). A number of battles require the traversal of a large amount of terrain, and even if you have light armor equipped and possess a VP regenerating skill, your characters will still deplete their gauges before the battle ends. This might not sound so awful, but when the gauge empties, your health begins to drop which subsequently cripples your party.  My final complaints, while not gameplay related, are still pressing. First: XF just doesn't feel like a Wild ARMs game. That Western style presentation the first titles in the series possessed gave them their charm, and XF lacks that. The game's character designs and plot feel nothing like the dusty, pistol-wielding numbers they should be. Second: there is a severe lack of animated cutscenes. The Wild ARMs games have always had beautiful anime clips that breathe some life into the experience, but only still pictures show up in XF, which is really disappointing.   Yes, "

While every game in this adventure series is good in its own way, this one (from developer Deck Nine as opposed to the series\u2019 creators at Dontnod) addresses many consistent issues that have plagued the last three games. It proves to be the best in the series thanks to consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling mystery story with good pacing, useful supernatural abilities, and perhaps most importantly, dialogue choices that offer more depth and complexity with big and most small decisions that actually impact the story in meaningful ways throughout the course of five chapters. While you can certainly play each chapter in bits and pieces, they\u2019re all available immediately so you can binge its 14 hours of story in one sitting with no waiting. Every episode has good pacing, a clear goal, and plenty of suspense. Before writing this review, I played through True Colors multiple times and found no definitive way to experience the story. There\u2019s a notable difference from previous episodes in that there is no recap of the previous chapter when starting a new one or a teaser for the next after completing one, but in its defense, True Colors does not really need it.

After a mysterious accident, Alex uses her supernatural empathic abilities to bring the town\u2019s secrets to the surface. Personally, I wish that the trailers hadn\u2019t spoiled the nature of the central mystery for me, so if you haven\u2019t watched them yet, don\u2019t \u2013 I urge you to go in blind. Haven Springs is stunning thanks to its scenic Colorado views. From the snowy mountains in the far background to the wooden bridge that separates the bus stop from the main street filled with colorful flowers and a river stream, this is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date and a compelling and effective tourism ad for Colorado. Haven Springs is arguably the best setting in any Life is Strange game to date \u201c This is a small mountain town, and in typical small-town fashion, everyone knows their neighbors and their community is tight-knit. It comes across loud and clear that the residents genuinely care about each other. Some of this insight comes from Alex\u2019s phone, which shares details of her relationships with her friends with some text messages (the content of which varies depending on your in-game choices). Alex can also check out MyBlock, a Nextdoor-like social media platform where the townsfolk share local updates, Easter eggs, and local banter; some of which are pay-offs as a result of the choices Alex made around those characters. There\u2019s even a moment in which the entire town partakes in a LARP to cheer up a grieving kid. Seeing the townsfolk dress up in costumes in areas like the town\u2019s bar was by far my favorite moment of the entire story. There\u2019s even a light RPG element in that particular chapter that helps make the entire section a lot more fun to engage in. The people of Haven Springs also have a lot of life to them, which made me feel more emotionally invested in the community. Previous Life is Strange games have struggled with consistently giving NPCs compelling backstories and many of them were failed by poor writing. Alyssa Anderson in the original Life is Strange, Evan Harris in Before the Storm , Hank Stamper in the first episode of Life is Strange 2 all had a lack of depth that made them come off as stereotypes. But in True Colors, I can\u2019t name anybody who felt underserved. A lot of that comes from the excellent way in which you interact with them, which is enhanced by a supernatural phenomenon. Like Max Caufield in the original Life is Strange , Alex has an unexplained superpower: she can perceive strong emotions through colorful auras that outline people around her. It may not be as spectacular as turning back time, but it does go beyond just \u201creading\u201d people: if a person\u2019s feelings are strong enough, Alex will also begin to actually feel those emotions herself. It\u2019s almost like an out-of-body experience where she walks a mile in their shoes. What's the best Life is Strange game to date? Life is Strange Life is Strange: Before the Storm The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit Life is Strange 2 Answer See Results In some cases, both scripted and unscripted, Alex can interact with items that contain memories (basically audio logs) that share a bit more about certain characters. I found this to be a nice add-on to Alex\u2019s already robust empathic powers; not only can it help with dialogue choices big and small, it helps to add more perspective to Haven Springs\u2019 residents. In one instance after exploring the flower shop, I found a t-shirt memory that explained how Riley Lethe met her on-and-off-again boyfriend Mac Louden at a bot-fighting competition she participated in. And if you decide to go off the beaten path, you will be rewarded with an additional backstory for certain characters that Alex will write in her journal. Her journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character you\u2019re playing as \u2013 sometimes she will write new lyrics or share extensive detail on when she engages in another\u2019s strong emotions; you can even playback the optional memories you find. One of my favorite aspects of Deck Nine\u2019s handling of Life is Strange\u2019s story-driven format is that, unlike previous games in this series, there are so many choices \u2013 regardless of size \u2013 that impact Alex\u2019s journey and future. One example of True Colors maintains throughout the story involves a side plot with Eleanor Lethe who early on in the game you find out she is having health issues, in particular, she is suffering from memory loss. But no one in town, not even Riley, who sees Eleanor is a material figure knows of her illness. At one point late in the story just as Riley is about to leave for college, you can tell her about Eleanor\u2019s condition, but having previous conversations with both will leave you with the choice of whether to be honest and tell Riley the truth and risk violating Eleanor\u2019s trust or keep the secret and allow Riley to go away to school. Those consequences and reactions feel real and consistent thanks to the detailed facial animations and appropriate body language of NPCs. Sure, some of those reactions are emphasized and spelled out when an aura appears, but even without the aura I always had a good understanding of how a character was feeling after Alex interacted with them. Alex's journal feels very much like her and offers insight into the character \u201c Because of the increased emphasis on the consequences of our actions, there were many times when I made a choice and had to second-guess whether that was what I wanted to do. No other Life is Strange game has made me reload a checkpoint save just to see a cutscene play out differently. There were times in previous games when I felt the writers would have dialogue options, you could have multiple options for a dialogue choice that is consistent with the overall protagonist, but another option felt \u201cforced\u201d or out of place. But Deck Nine\u2019s superb writing offers multiple dialogue options that all feel like something Alex would say and remain consistent with her personality. By the time you get to Chapter 5, the effects of most of the choices you\u2019ve made will play out in one way or another. It was a lovely surprise to see just how many decisions I made in earlier episodes metamorphosed into my own personal-feeling version of Chapter 5. Life is Strange has always been a series with high replayability, but this level of detail and variation in scenes makes True Colors even more rewarding for me to replay again and again. Like the previous installments, Life is Strange: True Colors has multiple endings that can result from the choices you make, none of which is a canonically \u201ctrue ending.\u201d While I initially thought I had a good idea of how the story would go, Deck Nine managed to keep me guessing \u2013 and by the time the plot twist came I was left in disbelief, eager to see how the final parts would play out. Yet each ending \u2013 and their variations \u2013 all felt natural to Alex, and she remained true to the character of someone who is happy and hopeful for the future that lay ahead. I also loved that even when Alex solves the main mystery, there are still plenty of secrets for her to discover around Haven Springs. The seeds of these side stories are planted through clever foreshadowing and hints for the curious among us, and their revelations always felt rewarding to me. There are even optional stories that happen in each episode where Alex can use her abilities to help people, such as helping a man guess how many jelly beans are in a jar so he can win the $100 gift card to take his mom out to a nice meal, boosting a runner\u2019s self-esteem, or helping pair up a couple of friends with a mutual attraction to one another but were too scared to make a move. Even among the core cast of characters, in my first few playthroughs, there was always something new I could learn about them that allowed me the opportunity to form a better bond with them. Here's what we thought of the final episode of Life is Strange: Life Is Strange \u2014 Episode 5: Polarized is a fascinating exploration of a teenager deeply affected by loss, trauma, suffering, and failure. This is not the coming-of-age story Life Is Strange pretended to be early on, though. Polarized is destructive, unquestionably the bleak climax of the murder mystery that\u2019s been dormant during most episodes, and it only somewhat works by the time Max Caulfield arrives to her ending. It\u2019s disappointing to see Life Is Strange lean into its angrier story threads to complete its otherwise-touching human story, but its emotional closure and character resolutions make this a more memorable ending than its unnecessarily dark plot twists. - Mitch Dyer, October 21, 2015 Score: 6.5 Read the Life is Strange Episode 5: Polarized Review Deck Nine also far outshines Dontnod in the romance department, with two strong options that Alex can pursue in Ryan and Steph. In previous Life is Strange games, especially Dontnod\u2019s (Life is Strange 1 & 2), you had the option to romance either a male or female character and choose the protagonist\u2019s sexuality, but I found those games to have lackluster options. Yes, that decision is a small piece of a much larger puzzle, but when I look back at them, Dontod\u2019s poor writing always offered a strong bias towards one potential partner over the other. By comparison, Deck Nine offers an equal playing field to both Ryan and Steph, and when I played the first four chapters for the first time I was unsure who I wanted Alex to be with \u2013 or whether to choose one of them at all since you\u2019re given the ability to opt-out of romance altogether. Both characters have their pros and cons and it\u2019s quite clear Deck Nine is placing the ball in your court, and neither feels like they are getting the short end of the stick."

        "Subtitle": "It's all about that one moment.",
        "Content": "The middle chapter of Telltale\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy series feels like a long windup to a single, meaningful punch. Very little of consequence to the plot takes place until the very last sequence, in which you\u2019re asked to make probably the most momentous decision so far. It\u2019s a pivotal point for everything that came before and likely will come after, but of the 90 minutes in this episode, most of it isn\u2019t terribly exciting. After Peter Quill and Rocket took their turns in episodes 1 and 2, Episode 3: More Than a Feeling puts the sisters Gamora and Nebula in the spotlight for a brief flashback mission from when they were both still in Thanos\u2019 service. It injects some quicktime action into the script by having powerful characters briefly bash on generic Kree mooks, but there\u2019s not much in the way of meaningful stakes, so it falls flat. Playing through the events first from Gamora\u2019s perspective and then from Nebula\u2019s reveals some details each character had that the other didn\u2019t, casting their motivations and attitudes toward each other in a different light. But the writing just didn\u2019t connect with the same emotional weight as previous episodes, and there was a clear, seemingly correct answer to resolve it all, rather than presenting a difficult choice. Most of the writing in this episode is high quality.Otherwise, the great bulk of More Than A Feeling is not much more than a lot of talking. The mystery in Peter\u2019s visions is resolved in a somewhat anticlimactic way, though it does introduce the character of Mantis, a shy empath who rounds out the cast well. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t help bring any sense of urgency or drama to a script so focused on people discussing what they\u2019re going to do while actually doing very little. Dialogue and character development is all well and good, and most of the writing in this episode is high quality, exploring tensions between the Guardians by creating a conflict over the proper use of power. It just took up more screen time than I would have liked in an adaptation of a comic book and film series known for snappy pacing and lots of action. Telltale does manage to cap it off with an exciting, comic book punch-up that requires a team that\u2019s never stood more divided to work together for a common cause. In the midst of it all, I made a choice about the Eternity Forge that potentially has massive ramifications for the remaining two episodes. If it really turns out to be as important as it seems, that would make for a really interesting set of branching endings. But there is also the possibility that everything will converge back on roughly the same point regardless of what we choose here. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Telltale has done this with seemingly important events.",

        "Content": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter begins with the words, \u201cThis game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand.\u201d That single sentence defines the gorgeous world of Ethan Carter perfectly: like Gone Home and Dear Esther , it\u2019s a fantastic first-person exploration game that focuses on tone, freedom, and environmental storytelling in lieu of combat. You play a detective on the trail of the titular missing boy in rural Wisconsin. You have the ability to see into the past and piece together memory fragments, which play out in the form of Ethan Carter\u2019s great puzzles. These smart challenges reward you with bits of backstory, and the actual act of solving them fit in with the eerie Lovecraftian tone. My favorite puzzle had me using scratch paper to piece together the former layout of a now-burned-down house from flashes of someone else\u2019s memories. It\u2019s rare that a game in 2014 gets me jotting down physical notes, but like Fez , Device 6 , and Legend of Grimrock , Ethan Carter trusts that you have the patience and drive to solve its mysteries.  The puzzles simultaneously provide interesting challenges, smart world building, and insight into who you are and the folks wrapped up in this disappearance truly are. On top of this, the writing does does a fantastic job of creating distinct characters and an effective gothic-horror vibe. Interesting parables are scattered throughout the world, and while they\u2019re certainly entertaining on a surface level, digging a bit deeper into their subtext helps flesh out Ethan Carter\u2019s main story in some really great ways. The way events unfold and the mysteries that linger after the credits roll trust you to come to your own conclusions, which is how I like my storytelling delivered.  Aside from the writing, a lot of Ethan Carter\u2019s power also comes from impeccable environmental storytelling. Right from the get-go, you\u2019re free to explore the wilderness to your heart\u2019s content. Areas can be visited in any order you want, delivering a sort of freedom that allowed me to personalize my time. It takes about 25 minutes to run across the breadth of Ethan Carter\u2019s wilderness, but you\u2019ll definitely want to take your time and soak it in. The world is filled with tiny details and scraps of information that beg to be devoured. Which is fantastic, because The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played.  What\u2019s even more impressive is that you right from the start, you can wander anywhere you want without without a single loading screen to pull your out of the experience. Seriously, I can\u2019t count the number of times I stopped moving and just lingered on a view throughout my three-hour journey. Sprawling valleys, shimmering lakes, and autumnal forests make Ethan Carter one of those games where I want to screencap nearly every single moment. The keyword there is nearly, because while I loved most of my time in Ethan Carter, there\u2019s one area that\u2019s much weaker than the rest. I found myself spending far too much time lost in a visually unimpressive mine trying to solve a particularly frustrating puzzle. When I finally discovered the solution after one of the longest hours of my gaming life, I felt cheated. Unlike the rest of the puzzles, I didn\u2019t earn the reward, but rather stumbled upon it. Despite that one area being notable low-point, the rest of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is remarkable. The combination of its gorgeous visuals and powerful mysteries make it one of those games that stuck with me and begged to be replayed.",

        "Content": "Some re-releases feel like the return of a welcome old friend, others like an unwanted school reunion with old acquaintances who peaked long ago. Thankfully, Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a roleplaying game that remains as worthwhile and wonderful as it was in 2005 . the core premise and structure still hold strong, and are further improved by some well-implemented new features.  Fundamentally, this is a Japanese RPG of the most recognisable type. The turn-based battle system does little that you\u2019ve not seen in countless other games, the quality of the writing ebbs and flows from the weirdly charming to charmingly weird and back again, and there\u2019s a familiar nature to the way you travel between towns, dungeons, and open environments crawling with enemies.   What sets this adventure apart from the majority of its peers, including those that have come since its initial PlayStation 2 debut, is the skill with which everything is produced and sewn together. Not a single element feels out of place, and not a feature is wasted in the quest to deliver a game that demonstrates just how gratifying the traditional structure of a JRPG can be. Everything from the visuals to the writing, the battles to the world map layout has been produced and delivered with a flair and skill that can come only from its designers understanding precisely the framework within which they\u2019re working.  Take the character design, for instance, which is nothing short of incredible and surely represents some of famed designer Akira Toriyama\u2019s best work. This is the man responsible for drawing characters in everything from Dragon Ball Z to Chrono Trigger, with the Dragon Quest VIII cast adhering to the same exacting standards of quality.  Much of the reason why this game manages to continue to feel so enticing and ageless comes down to that character design, the cel-shaded art style, and the bold, almost rainbow-like color palette proving themselves immune to the dulling effects of time.This quality of design helps to embed each character with a unique persona before they\u2019ve even opened their mouths. Yangus is stumpy and round, conveying his rough, inelegant personality while the sometimes pompous, arrogant Angelo has a trendy, elaborate fashion sense to match.   Characterization is further enhanced by full voice acting, some of which is new to this release, the constant presence of which adds more weight to the brilliant English-language localization. There\u2019s a slapstick quality to much of the voice work, which highlights and embellishes the humour-heavy script in a manner that is in keeping with the ridiculousness of the central storyline.  This 80-hour plus offering is one that begins with the conceit that you need to travel the world to investigate how to break a spell that has transformed the king of the land of Trodain into a small green troll and the princess into a large white horse. It\u2019s a setup that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Monty Python, or Pee-Wee\u2019s Big Adventure \u2013 albeit with (generally) more swords and dragons.  The central plot is not the primary reason to lose yourself in the narrative, that instead comes down to the fantastic dialogue and the entertaining character interactions. Really, this is a game about unlikely partnerships and relationships and how very different people are able to look beyond their differences and work towards a goal that would be unattainable for any individual. This is a story about characters more than it is about plot.   An option to play through battles at fast-forward speeds has been added, and it\u2019s a great feature that takes into consideration the portable nature of the 3DS. Those relatively brief moments on bus and train journeys can be taken up with progressing through dungeons quickly rather than waiting for animations to play out. This comes in particularly handy if you\u2019re spending time grinding to level up in anticipation of a tough boss fight.  Other than that time-saving option, the biggest alteration to the way battles work is that encounters are no longer random. In the original release, monsters attacked without warning, as they do in Pokemon and Final Fantasy VII, but here you see them moving out in the open and therefore decide whether or not to engage, as in Ni No Kuni and Final Fantasy XV.  This has a marked change on the overall pacing in that, in effect, you\u2019re given governance over how often you draw your sword. If you come to the conclusion that you\u2019d rather not engage in combat, perhaps because you\u2019re low on health and out of medical supplies, then you can take a route towards a town or other safe haven that avoids conflict.  Ultimately, it pays to fight as often as you can in order to move up the levels and become more powerful. Still, having the option to hobble safely back to town with my tail between my legs rather than losing progress is a welcome one, and itmakes me feel more in charge of my own moment-to-moment destiny.  Battles themselves are simple turn-based affairs that ask you to intelligently decide between whether to attack or defend in any given moment. Exploration forces you to think about the trade-off between potential rewards for moving forward and the risk of dying and having to retrace your footsteps. In continuously presenting these little decisions, Dragon Quest VIII kept me interested and on my toes, whilst topping off these mini-conflicts with a comedy script that fills regular pauses in the action with levity.  These new features represent a sweetener to the package, but they\u2019re not the real reason to invest your time into Dragon Quest VIII. Just as it was over a decade ago, it\u2019s a grand example of how you can add value to a genre without necessarily breaking any of its rules.  If you\u2019ve played the PlayStation 2 original then it\u2019s worth stepping back in not only as a remembrance of just why it was so good the first time around, but because it\u2019s still great today.. If you\u2019re new to this goofy adventure then it\u2019s an excellent example of how much traditional JRPGs still have to give. No matter your level of familiarity, the bottom line is that Dragon Quest VIII is still as entertaining today as it was in 2005."

        "id": "d87576f4f3fd9c6585eb325b561e85e1",
        "Content": "A doggedly traditional Japanese RPG in many respects, Bravely Second: End Layer is almost exactly as they used to make them in the old days. If you're of the mind that publisher Square Enix hit its peak during the 90s with the likes of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, then this is very much aimed at you. However, Bravely Second\u2019s charming sense of nostalgia can\u2019t fully make up for its failings. Whilst its turn-based battles are still engaging, and its art just as visually arresting, it tells a ridiculous and often patronizing story with lifeless, even frequently irritating voice work. It\u2019s a game that swings from providing great joy to deep disappointment without any warning and, as such, falls short of the bar set by Bravely Default. The setup is predictably straightforward, and lacks any nuance whatsoever. Pose Agnes, one of the previous game's protagonists, is kidnapped by the villainous (and subtly named) Kaiser Oblivion. It's up to you, as idealistic young knight Yew Geneolgia, to assemble a team capable of rescuing Agnes and, in the process, realign the forces of good and evil. Given that it's based in the same world, with some of the same characters and even returning locations, it does pay to have played through Bravely Default before starting the journey here. Honestly, though, even with the foundation of the first game embedded in your memory, it's a terrible plot. We've seen this all before and you've likely already got a pretty good idea in your mind about how, in general terms, it all plays out. Things are not helped by some questionable voice acting and a script that tries too hard to be funny, and fails in the process. Combat to the Rescue And yet, Bravely Second\u2019s gameplay manages to pull it out of these holes to become a mostly rewarding JRPG. The strategic and highly adaptable battle system from Bravely Default returns essentially in unaltered form, with the 'Brave' and 'Default' options setting it apart from other turn-based approaches. If you decide to Brave then you can spend multiple future turns in a single move, whilst the Default option sees you go defensive by opting to miss a turn in return for building up spare attacks to use in future. Having your healer Default regularly during boss battles, for example, tends to be a smart option as it allows you to unleash four healing spells in a single turn. Many of Bravely Second's more difficult opponents possess a single devastating attack that is capable of crippling the health of your entire party, so keeping health regeneration spells fully loaded is a good habit to fall into as quickly as possible. This system heavily rewards long-term planning, and properly punishes tactical short-sightedness. Only in a JRPG could feeding someone a poisoned treat in the heat of battle bring success. \u201c Bravely Second\u2019s contribution to the system comes from layering on further complexity with a huge number of Jobs (read: classes) to select from and use. These include classes typical of the Final Fantasy series - such as the Thief, Monk, Dark Knight, and Black and White Mages - and range to more exotic ones like the Performer and Patisserie. The former is dressed in Elvis-style threads and sings to bestow stat buffs to allies, whilst the latter can create desserts that deal negative status effects. Only in a JRPG can feeding someone a poisoned treat, in the heat of battle, bring success. Theoretically, the volume of Job opportunities should provide a sense of exhaustive diversity and limitless potential, but in reality I only ever bothered with a small handful of them. While there is an obvious advantage to having a single character become proficient in multiple areas, leveling them up requires such a big time investment that fixing each party member with a single job for life is the only way to play without Bravely Second practically taking over your entire existence. Yes, this approach means you miss out on seeing everything it has to offer, but it\u2019s easily preferable to grinding the same areas for hours to get your new Job level to a point where you can take on the next area's enemies. Wonderful World And I always wanted to get to the next area sooner rather than later, because one of Bravely Second's primary joys is found in entering a new location for the first time.  Despite the story woes, there\u2019s some excellent world-building here, with environments that allude to an engrossing history, and a potential future. The moments immediately following the game's opening narrative twist, for instance, are indicative of the developers\u2019 ability to bake a sense of drama right into the environment. The towering, pastel-shaded spires of Yew's home city punch themselves into the sky in powerful defiance against nature, their presence standing as evidence of the civilisation's power - a power undermined by evidence of an enemy infiltration and the realization that Yew and his people have been defenceless all along. If the writing were as sophisticated as the visual storytelling, then there would be far less to complain about. In 3D, these beautiful environments look even better, making this one of the few games for Nintendo's 3DS that is unquestionably improved by playing in 3D throughout. To say that the visual design is worth the price of admission alone would be a gross overstatement, but it goes a very long way towards overcoming the bland plot and characters."

He's feverish and obviously in a great deal of pain. Navigating the wayward deliveryman across the breadth of a southern forest becomes a laborious task in KRZ Act II, but your hampered pace only emphasizes the desire to take your time and soak in the surroundings. This is not an adventure game meant to be devoured at a frantic pace. KRZ is most affecting when you stop and let the surreal visuals, beautiful music, and masterful prose swirl together and fill your lungs.  The gorgeous, dreamlike presentation of Act I is only heightened during this second foray into the wilds of rural Kentucky. Picking up right where we parted ways with Conway, developer Cardboard Computer fully commits to the simmer of surrealism that bubbled up to the surface of Act I. From the get-go, nothing in KRZ is as it appears.  KRZ handles magical realism better than nearly any game I've ever played. The banal veneer of rural Kentucky, complete with empty highways, desolate gas stations, and stark government buildings lull you into an effective state of boredom just long enough for Cardboard Computer to pull the rug out from under you. The wooden slats of a run-down shack peel away to reveal dreamlike worlds, giant birds that soar through the skies, and a highway that now unfolds like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole.  But the places you travel to are only half of KRZ's charm -- the rest lies in its cast of characters that feel like they're ripped straight out of Twin Peaks. Despite Act II clocking in at a painfully short hour, most of which is spent posing new questions instead of answering lingering ones, Cardboard Computer manages to introduce a wealth of new and fantastic characters. An aspiring artist working a dead-end job, a young boy in a state of denial regarding his brother, and a doctor who may hold the key to solving your existential crisis all help ensure that your brief trip is packed tightly with unforgettable encounters, each of which unfolds through masterful writing.  What I love so much about the dialogue choices throughout KRZ is that they're not about telling the truth or lying, because whatever you answer becomes the truth. In answering a question regarding the name and gender of your canine companion, you're in fact fleshing out that aspect of the story. Whether Conway belabors the pain of his injury, or shrugs it off in favor of completing his delivery is completely up to you, and those types of decisions change the way characters in the world interact with you. It's here where my desire to replay each act comes in, due mostly to the impeccable writing present throughout KRZ.   Rarely does the prose of a video game stick with me. The story, sure -- I'll never forget the narrative beats of The Walking Dead, Catherine, or Metal Gear Solid. But none of those aforementioned classics managed to turn a phrase in a way that dug deep into my mind. After finishing Act II, I spent days reciting specific lines of dialogue in my head, finding a new layer of meaning with each repetition. The writing oscillates between being blunt like Charles Bukowski and layered like Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  When you stumble upon a church-turned-museum, the caretaker greets you by saying, \"I guess this must look pretty strange: a church without a congregation.\" Dialogue like this is the reason I love Kentucky Route Zero. If you go in expecting the tropes of traditional adventure games, prepare to be a bit turned off . Once again, KRZ turns its back on assumed staples of the genre, things like obtuse puzzles and a demand for rigorous note-taking, and instead delivers a thoughtful experience free of any mental friction whatsoever. If you crave a game that challenges your wits or physical acumen, you might as well take a bypass around this five-part adventure. But if you're seeking a thought-provoking and often spiritual look at a gorgeously surreal world, the second act of KRZ will whet your appetite and give you complete faith in Cardboard Computer's pentalogy. Here's to hoping that the gap between future chapters is less than the six months between Acts I and II."

        "Content": "Fallout: New Vegas ' similarities to Fallout 3 are obvious. The setting is different, but the aesthetic is the same \u2013 crumbling buildings, settlements comprised of shacks, unending waves of dusty, tortured wasteland dotted with ruins from a happier past. The combat is the same, with the same divisive VATS system that lets you target limbs or gun arms to cripple an enemy's ability to fight back. You still rely on your PIP-boy, a Filofax for the post-apocalyptic future, to organise the weapons, armour, quests, information and salvage that you can scavenge from your hopeless surroundings. You'll forgive me, then, for focussing on the things that are different. Because in some respects Fallout: New Vegas is a very different game from Fallout 3, and that's largely because it's better written. It understands that sometimes you must do awful things for a greater cause, or choose the best of two bad options. It offers you decisions all the time, but it rarely forces you to make any. It understands that morality is ambiguous, and subjective, and that games shoving obvious choices in your face undermines their emotional maturity. It knows that sometimes there is no right choice. It often fools you in this regard. The game's central conflict between the people's militia, the New California Republic, and the slave-driven empire of Caesar's Legion seems like a black-and-white decision between well-meaning lawmakers and murderous, barbaric fiends, but neither of them is a force for good, and over the forty or fifty hours you can easily spend with the game you'll see the worst side of both of them. Similarly, the families vying for control of the the Mojave Wasteland's glittering, neon-lit New Vegas are all as bad as each other. Fallout: New Vegas' focus on factions is less facetious than it first appears; it's never just a matter of siding with one at the expense of another. The Mojave Wasteland, a post-apocalyptic Nevada, is a better setting than the Capital Wasteland. It's smaller, but there's no less to do, making uneventful treks across barren scenery a thing of the past. It draws you out all over the place, pointing you in four directions at once, never telling you to explore but rewarding you greatly when you take the risk. The complete absence of a mutant-infested subway makes it easier to get by without guns and handle situations the way you want to. When you eventually get to the New Vegas Strip, you realise that the rest of the wasteland so far has been foreplay. Your Luck stat suddenly becomes very important, especially if you get drawn into the city's sinful culture. New Vegas, like Fallout 2's New Reno, is at once fascinating and hugely depressing, a centre of tawdry entertainment for miserable, damaged, bored people run by malicious, manipulative powers. It's the embodiment of Fallout's nihilism, a cheap, neon shadow of former glory that's nonetheless the most attractive thing in a irreparably devastated world. Fallout: New Vegas has strong, clever dialogue as well as good writing and quest design. Characters are duplicitous, foul-mouthed, desperate, broken, suave, or all of the above. The voice acting is much better, too, which really helps carry the game's hundreds of interlocking stories. It's a serious game, overall, with moments that are genuinely sobering, but there's also a wicked undercurrent of black humour; in the face of such desolation, the Wasteland's inhabitants have developed an amusingly cynical worldview. Fallout's uncompromising violence, too, is double-edged; seeing crucified Caesar's Legion victims dying in agony isn't funny in any way, but watching a raider's head explode really is. This isn't all Obsidian's work, obviously. Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 share a talent for subtle scene-setting that Bethesda first mastered in Oblivion. Much of the wasteland's detail and narrative texture is in the background, in places that you're never told to go looking; written down in computer logs in abandoned buildings that have nothing to do with quests, strewn in a bloody mess at the roadside, hidden away in journals and lockboxes and side-rooms. The Mojave Wasteland is so believable because it's an incomplete puzzle. So often you'll push open a door to a new location somewhere out in the wastes, unprompted by mission markers, and know only that something terrible happened there. Bethesda knows how to build a game world that works, and Obsidian knows how to write quests and dialogue that aren't bland. They're a perfect fit. Like Fallout 3, New Vegas can feel inaccessible. This is a role-playing game in the classic sense; you have to play to your character's strengths. Becoming a nuke-launcher-wielding hard-ass with a Strength stat of 4 is impossible; equally, you'll never see all the dialogue options without high Charisma, and getting the most of the wasteland's technology needs high Intelligence. You'll close off options to yourself right from the first decisions you make about your character, but you'll also be forced into playing in non-conventional ways, and discovering the sheer breadth of options that New Vegas offers you \u2013 particularly in Hardcore Mode. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F112%2F1128811%2Ffallout-new-vegas-uk-review-20101019030501717.jpg&caption=America%27s+southwest+makes+a+perfect+fit+for+the+apocalypse.+ Playing Fallout: New Vegas in hardcore mode is a revolution. You become a true wastelander, collapsing onto whatever roadside mattress you can find to stave off sleep deprivation, lapping dirty water from toilet bowls to hydrate yourself, going through every bin and abandoned building you can find for morsels of irradiated food and dying almost every time you venture off the beaten path. Skills that otherwise lurk at the bottom of your priorities, like Unarmed and Survival, become absolutely essential. Perks that you'd otherwise skip over become lifesavers. It doesn't just make things harder \u2013 it's not a wasteland Hard mode that artificially gives mangy raiders thousands of hit points. It changes the whole way you play the game, completely altering your worldview. Ammunition has weight, so there's more of a reason to explore Fallout: New Vegas' vastly improved melee weapons. Instead of obsessing over your next quest goal, you're scouring the horizon for buildings that might have water, or a settlement that might have a doctor to heal your crippled limbs. Because Fallout: New Vegas' most important improvement upon Fallout 3 is the writing and quest design, it's impossible to wax lyrical about them without spoiling it, or to pick out particularly affecting characters and situations for fear of influencing how you might react to them. Like 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas is a game to share stories about, one that lets you carve your own path through a beautifully constructed world. If you felt that there was just something missing from Fallout 3 \u2013 some indefinable quality of soul \u2013 you may well find New Vegas especially satisfying."

        "Title": "Bound by Flame Review",
        "Subtitle": "Keeping the fire stoked",
        "Content": "It\u2019s a good thing that Bound By Flame\u2019s combat is its strongest point, because almost every major in-game conflict is resolved through violence. Structurally, it\u2019s largely linear; though smaller maps and quests can be explored and completed in different orders, it\u2019s always constrained by narrow corridors and a fairly rigid plot. Thankfully though, it strikes a harmony between its entertaining combat system and thoughtful role-playing progression, giving it a consistent forward momentum that held my attention despite its inconsistent story and writing. The role-playing systems that support the combat in Bound By Flame are simple, but quite effective. Your character has three skill trees, labeled Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer, but effectively serving as a slow sword, fast daggers, and spells. Combat stances can be toggled on-the-fly mid-battle, with your selection of fire spells being available in both. I found I spent most of the early game in the defensive Warrior stance, but finished the bulk of the campaign using the speedy Ranger daggers. Every progression choice felt like a viable play-style though, allowing me to find what I liked, and exploit it to the fullest. With each level gained you can choose what appear to be minor buffs, like a higher critical rating on fireballs, or health regeneration in Warrior stance. Very few of these skill improvements read like they\u2019re major enhancements on their own - this is not a game where you go from having 15 hit points to 1500 - but they cumulatively give your character a great feeling of progression. Make enough smart choices, and even something like slightly increasing the chance of dagger attacks interrupting enemy actions can make your character feel like a combat god. Much of Bound By Flame\u2019s combat is built around timing and precision, like when you face opponents who carry shields on their front and their back. You\u2019ll need to either hit them from their flanks with daggers, or best them with perfectly-timed blocks and counter-attacks. The notably responsive controls are up to the task, conveying the rhythms of one-against-many combat surprisingly well. The same can\u2019t be said for some of the single-opponent fights though, which can be either predictable and easy, or downright cheap, though those are happily quite rare. Bound By Flame creates a bleak fantasy world, which it attempts to fill with a grimy, cynical perspective and dark humor. Sadly, neither the writing or voice acting are strong enough to quite pull off these ambitious storytelling goals. Its mercenaries are unsurprisingly profane and written to be amusingly juvenile, but their bawdy insults and nasty jokes are only clever half the time.The other half they fall flat thanks to wildly inconsistent voice acting and writing, which often wind up being unintentionally amusing. Bound By Flame also misses the mark with its much-touted ability to choose how to deal with the demon that has possessed your body. The big choices you\u2019re supposed to make often end up being immediately irrelevant. Will you decide to join the battle for a major city, or ignore it and follow the demon\u2019s quest? Either way, you\u2019re sent to fight for the city. Many other times you aren\u2019t even given choices at all; the demon simply takes over and does what it wants anyway. This lack of consistency makes caring about Bound By Flame\u2019s plot far too difficult to sustain. Need a dentist? On the plus side, much of the rest of Bound By Flame\u2019s presentation worked well. I quite liked most of the music, particularly some of the arrhythmic, drum-based tracks used during more demonic battles. The character models and animations are strong as well, particularly on the smooth-running PC version. However, I was disappointed by how jerky the frame rate got on PS4 when special lighting and water effects appeared on-screen.",

        "Content": "In a video game industry that often feels like it\u2019s bloating into a monolithic, unsustainable beast propped up by annual staples and once every generation blockbusters, a small silver lining is that it\u2019s still big enough for games like The Thaumaturge to exist. This mid-size RPG may not match the jaw-dropping scale of a game like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 , but it\u2019s still packed with atmosphere and good ideas that are mostly well executed. Aside from some buggy movement and odd voices, the turn-based combat is full of interesting strategic choices, and its great writing and story manage to punch up tried and true point-and-click clue finding and lore gathering. You play as the eponymous Thaumaturge, a sort of Witcher / John Constantine mash up of a supernaturally gifted human and an extraplanar detective named Wiktor. His journey to uncover the circumstances of his father\u2019s death often finds him plying his esoteric trade both in service of this goal, and as a distraction from it. The various intertwining stories of a Poland at the brink of revolution, as well as Wiktor discovering all the ways things have changed at home in his fifteen year absence, tie a compelling narrative knot across its 20 hour run time. The Thaumaturge Gameplay Screenshots 55 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Though I found a lot of its main and side stories to be interesting, the slow pace does mean you\u2019ll spend long stretches of time reading and listening before being given a chance to act. When you do, usually through dialogue options that can vary based on past choices or your own abilities, sometimes The Thaumaturge asked me to make assumptions about Wiktor\u2019s life and old relationships that I had no context for. For instance, it regularly asks you to either be nice or a jerk to people who apparently know him, but doesn\u2019t give you adequate reason to decide one way or the other. The voice acting can also be a bit shaky, with accents that are all over the place \u2013 more than one person that is supposed to be a native to the region sounded like I could have met them in a Wawa here in the great state of New Jersey. That said, I did like that dialogue options regularly felt risky, and limitations imposed by previous encounters or Wiktor\u2019s current stats made chatting people up feel like a challenge. I can\u2019t speak to how differently any of these exchanges would go if I chose some other option, or how long it would take to reach the consequences of those choices, but The Thaumaturge at least puts on a convincing show of giving you meaningful control over its events. The good writing that accompanies clues adds some heightened drama. \u201c Quests involve a lot of snooping around, investigating objects both mundane and magical in private and in public, all to earn \u201cobservations,\u201d which are clues you can draw about the people who interacted with them based on any lingering emotional residue. The lingering lust on bedsheets or wily chaos on a stray bullet stuck in a wall can help you draw conclusions about the people who were involved with these things. Even though this largely means using your perception to investigate glowing objects in a more mystical version of Batman\u2019s detective mode, the particularly good writing that accompanies the clues does add some heightened drama as you work to put all the pieces together in your head before The Thaumaturge puts a giant neon sign on the right answers for you. Turn of the 20th century Europe is a comfortable setting for all this political drama and magical intrigue. The Russian imperial expansion into Poland, and the latter\u2019s revolution against the intruders, is thick with the kind of tension only a ghost skeleton with a Cavalry saber can cut. The constant push and pull between the occupiers and the increasingly more disgruntled citizens is something Wiktor\u2019s supernatural adventure is constantly butting up against, and it really helps keep this story grounded and relatable even when things get dense with lore and macguffins, which is a hallmark of good science fiction.

Answer See Results I\u2019m not an expert in the period, so when I say everything looks the part \u2013 from the hairstyles to the clothing to the architecture \u2013 just know it\u2019s coming from a guy who\u2019s seen Doctor Zhivago once and thought it was fine. It\u2019s not groundbreaking in its fidelity, but colors, textures, and lighting are pretty good looking at their best. Moving around Poland is sometimes a little glitchy , but it\u2019s a city that is dense with people to speak to and stuff to find that I was excited to explore. Warsaw is filled to the brim with folk who\u2019d rather you and your brethren be dead or maimed than in their business, and luckily when combat does break out, you aren\u2019t alone. Salutors, the spiritual beings that haunt the people and places of the world, can be tamed to assist you. Each has their own strengths and types, which can be used against certain kinds of enemy weaknesses, Pokemon -style. Among my go-tos were Bukavac, a snarling beast who is great at applying negative states to enemies, or Lelek, a chaotic bird demon who can drive enemies mad. Combat is never boring, but it\u2019s not particularly challenging, either. \u201c Weaving Wiktor and your chosen salutor\u2019s attacks together to most optimally synergize your offense never felt boring, though it\u2019s not particularly challenging, either \u2013 even on the highest difficulty, it wasn\u2019t until the very end of my adventure that the fights truly tested my brain. This is partially because all of your currently captured Salutors are available at any time to switch back and forth between, so you always have access to your enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities, but also because you get so much information about the goings on of every turn. You\u2019ll be able to plan around who\u2019s up next, what kind of attack they are going to use, and how close to death everyone is when queuing up your attacks, and while getting near perfect information in battle is a great thing, the enemies don\u2019t seem to have the same ability to make good decisions with it that I did. Enemies are 90% regular guys reskinned in different clothing or uniforms, wielding knives, clubs, guns, or even their fists. They may not be visually compelling, but most of their attacks do things more than straight damage, like adding detrimental status effects or draining your focus to open you up to big damage. Wiktor, combined with all of the potential spirits he can wrestle under his control, have quite a menu of offensive options themselves. Though many fights with these random goons seem to happen out of nowhere and for what should be easily avoidable reasons, it doesn\u2019t hurt to gain as many opportunities as possible to practice all of your potential options, as well as gain points to level up your thaumaturgy skills, which boost your stats, give you access to even more attacks, and potentially unlocks new discovery and dialogue opportunities.

Besides usually being more visually striking fights, with the added twist of having an untargetable character afflicting the battle in some way, they play out largely the same as other encounters. They do tend to be more challenging and provide satisfying punctuations to some of the campaign\u2019s more interesting side missions, but I also wish they got a little spicier, tactically, considering the enemies you get to face off against."

        "Content": "Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s fifth and final act launches on PC on January 28 alongside its TV Edition, which brings the entire story to PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. This review is taking a fresh look at Kentucky Route Zero as a whole now that all five acts are complete.  I couldn\u2019t stop taking screenshots as I played Kentucky Route Zero. Almost every location in this surreal adventure game could be printed out and framed on the wall as a work of art all its own, but it\u2019s the strange and twisting story that fans have been following for nearly seven years that ties them all together. That mystical story can feel appropriately mysterious at times and confusingly arbitrary at others, but it\u2019s a heartwarming journey I\u2019m very glad to have taken.  Kentucky Route Zero is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure game, but to call it that can be misleading. It\u2019s only tangentially in the same realm as classics like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango, replacing item collection and puzzle solving with reams of intimate dialogue and an impressive amount of choice in how your characters navigate every conversation.  40 of My Favorite Screenshots From Kentucky Route Zero (Visual Spoilers!) 40 Images  You begin Act 1 as Conway, a delivery truck driver trying to get to an address that seemingly doesn\u2019t exist on any map, apparently only accessible through a peculiar hidden highway called the Zero. While that simple delivery goal is your motivation through Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s five acts, Conway slowly accumulates companions along the way, each an interesting character in their own right. Their presence lets you further shape the conversations they are faced with.  Through the Eyes of Another  One of my favorite things about Kentucky Route Zero is how frequently it shakes up the way its dialogue is delivered, constantly adding to its bag of tricks. Some scenes may be straightforward conversations from a classic point-and-click side view, while others are entirely from the perspective of security guards watching your characters through security footage and discussing the scene in the past tense.  Two of my favorite scenes include an Interlude between Acts 2 and 3 where you\u2019re watching a play from the perspective of a silent actor on stage, and another later on where you control a cat as they run around and listen to your characters\u2019 conversations instead of moving those characters directly. Since Kentucky Route Zero is almost entirely about finding and then clicking through dialogue options, this endless creativity is a vital reason the roughly eight hours it took me to reach the credits stayed fresh.   That said, things certainly start simpler, with the creative storytelling increasing greatly as the campaign progresses. While Kentucky Route Zero was initially released episodically, I had never played any of it until now, and the age of its first acts is abundantly clear. Act 1 and 2 were released in 2013, and their presentation and structure can pale in comparison to the latter acts at \u2013 especially when played in 2020 after games like Night in the Woods, which clearly took a page out of this book. (It also doesn\u2019t help that Conway\u2019s leg is broken for most of both acts, causing you to move at a frustratingly slow pace.)  In a very real sense, playing Kentucky Route Zero is like taking a walk through time. \u201c  In a very real sense, playing Kentucky Route Zero is like taking a walk through time, each episode growing more ambitious and unexpected than the last. As a result, every act is delightfully surprising even when played back to back \u2013 fully hooking me around Act 3 when it starts diverging further from a standard point-and-click structure. Still, the charming characters and captivating writing kept me interested the whole time, broken leg and all.  RPG \u2013 Random Poetry Generator  One of the first tasks you are given in Kentucky Route Zero is to unlock a computer, but this simple activity sets the stage for what you\u2019ll be doing essentially the entire game. The computer\u2019s owner tells Conway the password is some poem he enters through muscle memory, comically suggesting Conway just starts typing to see what happens. No matter what lines you pick from the pre-written options, you\u2019ll always enter the right password \u2013 that\u2019s the basis of this entire adventure.   As you travel the Zero and hunt for your MacGuffin delivery address, you\u2019ll constantly be picking dialogue options for your characters, not knowing the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to any of them \u2013 as soon as you choose, your answer becomes fact and, narratively, has always been fact. These choices can be as mundane as the name of Conway\u2019s dog (my sweet old girl was named Blue) or as deep as if a character has siblings and what the context of their relationship is to them. A particularly magical moment in Act 3 has you picking the lyrics to a gorgeous song as it\u2019s sung back to you in real time, coupled with more beautiful visuals. It easily stands as one of my favorite scenes in a game in a long time.  The choices you make never really change the outcome of the plot, but they do drastically shift what story you\u2019ll hear as you progress. And once your group of weary travelers grows and offers more perspectives for you to inhabit, dialogue can change even more. Instead of just choosing Conway\u2019s responses, you can often decide which character replies \u2013 whether its Conway himself, the more forthright Shannon (your other lead protagonist and the first to join his journey), or a whimsically imaginative child named Ezra. Either option generally locks off the other responses entirely \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole novel\u2019s worth of dialogue I didn\u2019t see.  By the final act, you\u2019ll control so many people that you\u2019re effectively just having conversations with yourself. \u201c  By the final act, you\u2019ll control so many people that you\u2019re effectively just having conversations with yourself. But, somehow, Kentucky Route Zero trained me up to that point so that, miraculously, it felt entirely natural. Besides, the discussions were so often engaging and interesting that I loved picking conversation paths and marching merrily down them of my own volition \u2013 it\u2019s the same as writing poetry for a computer password without ever knowing the \u201cright\u201d answer, just on a significantly more elaborate scale.  Rocky Roads  But while Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s writing is consistently strong, the way in which it\u2019s delivered sometimes isn\u2019t \u2013 the biggest problem being an overabundance of exposition. I adored that this is a strange and mysterious tale that doesn\u2019t outright explain much of its world, but then random characters you meet briefly in a gas station would abruptly launch into their life\u2019s story in direct opposition of that style. These dumps of backstory are always well-written, just hamfistedly presented, which caused Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s already slow and deliberate pacing to stutter at times   While Kentucky Route Zero often focuses on smaller story moments like this, the larger meat of its tale is a touching one, too. I ultimately took it as a story about home, both what home actually means and how people find it, either intentionally or unexpectedly. That theme recurs throughout without being shoved in your face, and I was fully invested in Conway and Shannon\u2019s journey whether I tried to read deeper into it or not.  The folk that join them along the way are worth getting attached to, as well, particularly Junebug and Johnny the musical duo \u2013 who are robots, I guess? \u2013 even if how or why any of these people start following you is never really justified. A couple of the big character moments were similarly under-explained and seemed frustratingly avoidable from the perspective of an onlooker \u2013 this certainly didn\u2019t happen often, but sometimes I wished for the level of control Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s constant dialogue choices make it feel like you have. Without spoiling anything, a few of the threads of key characters are left unsatisfyingly hanging by the time the credits roll, too.  The end of this seven-year story is really quite lovely. \u201c  This isn\u2019t really a story that wants (or even needs) to tie up all of those threads, and thankfully for the most part that works in its favor. Apart from that handful of incongruous disappointments, the end of this seven-year story was really quite lovely, leaning into many of Kentucky Route Zero\u2019s strengths without ruining the wonder at its heart with over explanation \u2013 a fate likely worse than the smaller missteps it did make along the way."

The episode feels more tied to both the familiar trappings of Walking Dead and Telltale Games' plot structures. Yet by building on the foundation of the last episode and the two seasons before it, the conclusion of this two-part opener sets up an intriguing rest of the season \u2014 one that makes me feel like my choices actually matter (even if that\u2019s likely an illusion).  Picking up from Part I\u2019s dramatic final moments, \u201cTies That Bind\u2019s\u201d second half forces Javi to learn the true cost of surviving in this world for the first time since his introductory flashback in the season premiere. It\u2019s easy to see how many dialogue choices and actions only matter in the moment, but I continued to care deeply about how Javi reacted to every blow to his family and his world. I fought to keep Javi\u2019s hope and determination alive, even as the world around him actively worked to shake him of that resilience. And some of those choices paid off within the episode itself as it deepened our understanding of Javi\u2019s relationships. Picking up an item in the environment leads to a kind gesture later in the episode, and the long-term work Javi puts in with Kate and the kids over these two episodes feels important, even if it isn\u2019t drastically altering the plot just yet. Without spoiling anything, however, I was excited to begin to notice how choices I made during Javi\u2019s flashbacks are helping to define relationships in the present. Even if it's just in passing conversations, it's reassuring to see my influence actually carrying some narrative weight. \u201c The same can be said of Clementine, whose flashback in Part II feels much more important than in the premiere. The episode thankfully gives us some more details about the title of the season\u2019s meaning (other than its obvious metaphorical idea), and the New Frontier\u2019s role in things is surprisingly malleable. They have an impact on Clementine\u2019s backstory, but it seems that we have some welcome input on that very impact, which imbues some of the moments in the present-day story with some nice additional emotional heft. And reaching even further back into Clementine\u2019s history, choices made with her and even Lee in previous seasons will shift the tone of some side interactions with her. How they will continue to impact the season remains to be seen \u2014 I\u2019m not prepared to say just how much the overarching story will actually change this season because of those choices, because based on Telltale\u2019s history it\u2019s unlikely that a season\u2019s plot would branch in a significant way this early on \u2014 but this far into the series it's reassuring to see my influence actually carrying some narrative weight. Outside of those choices, however, Part II offers some sadly familiar events. After a tense standoff early in the episode, the remaining survivors head off to a supposed safe haven for medical attention, only to predictably find trouble along the way. Any Walking Dead fan will certainly find something repetitive in that idea, and the fun appearance of a familiar franchise character didn\u2019t make the overused plot ideas any less disappointing. But I was kept engaged by the continued strong character work, even if Part II lacks some of the cinematic flourishes that felt so special in Part I. And even when the episode's scenes fell into recognizable territory, the quicktime event action scenes were often executed with tense, well-paced scenarios.",

Both are proof that silly and light-hearted fiction can still be well written, just as simple characters can still be endearing and memorable.

It's true that the greater majority of video game writing is, by nearly any standard, pretty bad, but most games are smart enough to stick to what they're good at.

Choosing between power, break, and rush attacks to hit as many foes at a time while keeping your group spread out enough to avoid area-of-effect damage proves to be an enjoyable balancing act of tactical decision-making. The story isn't without its charms either, especially if you've grown up with video games and have sat, as I have, with a bag of popcorn in hand while watching the always-entertaining drama of the console wars pan out over the years. The entire plot isn't so much a thinly veiled metaphor about the game industry as it is a straight-up animated dramatization of it. It stops short of using actual console names (Lastation sounds an awful lot like...) but all the references are there. Any long-time follower of our fair hobby is bound to get a few chuckles and \u201coh I see what you did there\u201d moments out of the story. The problem is that it's all you'll get, and you have to suffer through a metric ton of terribly inane dialogue to get it. I honestly don't know who writes this stuff, or who it's even written for, but conversations in Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory are nothing but non-stop conveyor belts that deliver a seemingly infinite supply of quips and cracks usually reserved for playground banter. This of course makes it seem like something straight out of left field when characters start cursing at or bathing with one another. Even calling these entities \u201ccharacters\u201d is a stretch, as they're more like moe delivery systems, created for the sole purpose of being adorably vapid while wearing something frilly and/or fetishistic. Mind you, that's not necessarily wrong or offensive \u2013 it's just plain boring. Neptune, the story's protagonist, cares for little else besides eating, sleeping, and occasionally playing video games, and her travelling companions aren't any less one-dimensional. This could almost be forgiven if these scenes served as occasional asides to the combat, but infuriatingly, the opposite is true. This isn't nearly my only gripe with Victory, but it's certainly my biggest: the entire game feels like it was designed around getting you to the next interminable dialogue scene as quickly and conveniently as possible. Both towns and the world map are reduced to nothing but menus, and where to go next is always conveniently marked with a bright pink icon. The only places where you actually control an avatar of any kind are the combat areas, which feature visible, often non-aggressive enemies that you can completely avoid by just running in a straight line. Even in these so-called \u201cdungeons,\u201d the way to the exit is clearly marked on your map and is never more than a few 90-degree turns away, making them no more nuanced than the characters who explore them. The quest system is similarly shallow, offering you story-advancing tasks without ever establishing any connection to the plot. \u201cGo kill five of these,\u201d or \u201cgo find three of those\u201d is often all the explanation you get, and when you've just killed or found a bunch of each 10 minutes prior, you can only conclude that Victory is simply wasting your time with an arbitrary chore. The guild hall that gives the quests out usually has several on offer at a time, but don't mistake that for choice. There's no reason not to accept them all and then forget about them, since they'll be naturally accomplished through your routine killing and looting. This reduces quests to mere added bonuses earned for grinding rather than meaningful objectives that are meant to challenge and reward you for making extra effort. The end result of these design choices is that you spend just as much time suffering through story scenes as you do exploring and fighting, which is an absurd ratio even by RPG standards. I understand that the Hyperdimension games don't aim to be taken seriously, but if you expect players to spend a full half of their time reading text boxes with 2D portraits over them, then your writing had better be beyond reproach \u2013 or at least beyond grade school level. And that goes double if it has a choppy framerate despite looking like a PlayStation 2 game, like Victory does."

        "Content": "By spreading its sails and taking the journey to a creative and interesting setting, Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire finds fertile ground for interesting and nuanced roleplaying stories. The main storyline is its biggest weakness, but Deadfire comes into its own by drawing you into the surrounding saga of its embattled islands and the distinct peoples fighting over them. This island chain offers no shortage of fantastic tactical battles, fascinating allies, and exotic places to explore. 2015\u2019s Pillars of Eternity is a love letter to the Baldur\u2019s Gate school of classic isometric RPG, presented in the classic sword-and-sorcery style: a dark and thought-provoking adventure with elves, dwarves, plate mail, and fireballs. Deadfire, on the other hand, strikes a bold contrast and ditches most of these tropes for a less common style. By minimizing castles and forests in favor of a beautiful ocean and boats, and the sword-and-shield aesthetic for sabers and blunderbusses, Deadfire\u2019s 40-hour campaign almost feels like it takes place in a completely different world from the original despite the fact that it stars the same Watcher of Caed Nua character we originally played as.  You can even import your old save file or simulate one with a text-based Mass Effect-style quiz that gives you the character history you want (not necessarily the one you deserve). The consequences of certain major decisions in the original are very acutely felt in Deadfire, starting with the very first conversation as the gods themselves offer an accounting of your character\u2019s past actions. This interactive overworld is littered with scripted events and treasures to find. \u201c Gone is the static, painted overworld of the first Pillars, replaced instead by an atmospheric open ocean map upon which you sail your customizable ship freely from island to island and quest to quest. This interactive overworld is littered with scripted events and treasures to find, springs crew interactions on you at random. You can also be attacked by pirates, or privateers from rival factions, though the turn-based naval battles are so basic as to feel shoehorned in and not much fun. Those lengthy interruptions made sailing times stretch on longer than I\u2019d like, and the expensive upgrades, like new sails for my ship, barely made a perceptible difference when it came to outrunning threats. The main story of the voyage you embark upon in Deadfire is similarly prone to moments of feeling rudderless. You\u2019re on a quest to chase down the newly revived god of light and retrieve your soul, something you\u2019re given little incentive to do beyond simply being told it is necessary. The plot waits far too long to add enough context to your chase to give substantial motivation for partaking in it, considering you seem to be getting by just fine without. Fast progress, and the answer to the all-important question of \u201cwhy is this important,\u201d are gated behind enemies and areas so challenging that they demand you and your party be of a certain level that is usually far beyond where you currently are when you first encounter them.  However, that need to get stronger drove me to pursue the sidequests and tertiary plots, and this is where the writing of Deadfire truly began to shine. The main plot is surrounded by the intriguing and thoughtful open-world flavor of a region entering the crucible of historical change. At first, it was the tempting XP rewards that compelled me to seek out and explore the different islands, but after spending time among their people, appreciating the distinctive architecture of each village, learning about their different cultures, and hearing about their visions for the future of the diverse island chain, I found myself drawn into and invested in these small local problems much more than I was with the big one looming over my head. The tale of the Deadfire is the story of everyone in it, and you can encounter an ocean of stories across an expanse in a state of upheaval, with several complex and ambitious factions seeking to steer it a particular way. It isn't long before their leaders pitch you on their endgame and seek your allegiance, and the quests that arise from these calls for aid are the best in Deadfire. The Huana, the natives of the Deadfire Archipelago, seek to preserve their independence and their way of life against what amounts to the colonial intrusion of the other powers, but some caste-based aspects of the culture they seek to preserve are deeply flawed. The Valians seek to greedily exploit the potent natural resources of the islands, but if allowed to do so might bring about revolutionary progress. The Rauatai seek to unify the Deadfire islands with their nation to create a greater Aumaua empire, even if they have to do it by the sword and the cannon. If you prefer more mischief and less politics, you can always back the pirates, but even they have their own internal power struggle brewing as the older and more conservative pirate captains face off against younger reformers. Obsidian\u2019s writers seem to have gone out of their way to deny us moral certainty. \u201c Obsidian\u2019s writers seem to have gone out of their way to deny us moral certainty and create meaningful decisions, because matter who you side with some people will benefit and some will get hurt. This hits even harder when you\u2019re exposed to the consequences of your choices first-hand. The existence of the Huana cast system isn\u2019t an simply an entry in the codex; it\u2019s a reality for many poor and destitute Aumaua who turn to you for help. The ethically dubious land acquisition of the Vailians isn\u2019t just something heard about in a conversational aside, it\u2019s a problem its victims seek your aid in resolving. Deadfire\u2019s writing of these situations is a sterling example of the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d maxim. Because I was given the pros and cons of my allegiance with faces, names, and stories, the impact of my decisions was never far from my mind.  Faction quests aren\u2019t the only place to find compelling and complicated situations in the Deadfire Archipelago. While plenty of NPCs are simply background decoration, many residents of this dangerous land are fully voiced and fleshed-out people with pressing tasks and problems stemming from the major events happening around them. Whether it\u2019s reuniting a lost family member with his loved ones or trying to save (or condemn) a poor refugee family seeking a better life, the stories are varied and carry real emotional heft. This is aided in no small part by the tremendous feat of roleplaying immersion Deadfire pulls off; this world, and its people, have long memories, and they interact with you through the lens of a past your character may have had a substantial role in. People I helped early on either showed up later to vouch for me or sang my praises to other characters I hadn\u2019t yet encountered. Something as simple as helping a stranded missionary fix his broken wagon early on had effects that echoed throughout my entire playthrough. A seemingly innocuous conversation about the gods that I had with another individual turned out to be a defining moment for an entire group\u2019s worldview. In typical Obsidian RPG fashion, dialogue choices are heavily influenced by character stats. \u201c Similarly, in typical Obsidian RPG fashion, dialogue choices are heavily influenced by character stats, making which ones you choose to invest in feel like an important choice no matter how you play. My skills list and my character's reputation came up in nearly every interaction, with unique dialogue options available if I was good enough at an activity like diplomacy or sleight of hand, or had a good enough reputation with a certain group or just as an individual, or was from a particular place or race. So deep and varied are these opportunities for diverse roleplaying that they offer tremendous replayability just to see how these experiences might diverge if a totally different Watcher stars in them. At one point, I got out of a situation that seemed destined for conflict because my Watcher possessed a silver tongue and a gift for reading other people. Would a happy ending have instead turned to bloodshed if I played a crueler, more coarse character? My Watcher became adept at socializing and skullduggery, but his lack of survival skills made him a fish out of water in the uncharted terrain of Deadfire's islands. Party members can lend an assist with skills of their own, but this is usually only enough to get over a hump; it doesn\u2019t fully compensate for a complete lack of competence in any one area. This opened new encounters and outcomes to me and closed others entirely. An encounter with a reclusive tribe of xaurips can either end in a fight, or an amicable parting with some loot. A Watcher who is unable to intimidate a group of thugs into backing down might make a stubborn enemy. Sometimes, it stuck in my craw to see a situation spin out of my control, or end in a way I was desperate to avoid simply because I\u2019d invested in the wrong skills, but this was more than balanced out by the feeling of satisfaction I received from solving an intimidating problem with my core competencies. This is an RPG that\u2019s unafraid to take the character you\u2019ve chosen to build and make you stand by them. 35 Images  Obsidian\u2019s writers\u2019 talent for writing characters is on full display once again as Deadfire debuts a handful of new party members and carries over a few from the original (assuming they\u2019re still around in your story), all of whom are all extremely well written and developed with complex and often conflicting motivations for tagging along. Returning companion Eder is as charming and sympathetic as ever, resuming his role as the group\u2019s moral compass, and the furry blue brigand Serafen is positively oozing with personality, always ready with one-liner or savage insult. They aren\u2019t going to agree with every decision you make, or with each other. If tensions between party members rise high enough, fights can break out between companions, full-on arguments with \u201cthem or me\u201d undertones. I never found myself unable to juggle the personality clashes that arose between my companions, but these conflicts were handled in such a way that I truly felt pressured to closely manage my parties\u2019 relationships with each other, not just with me. I actually felt like the leader of this motley bunch, not because the story simply dictated it, but because I had to participate in the work of keeping a group together. I actually felt like the leader of this motley bunch. \u201c It was rewarding to see my influence bleed over into my relationships with my companions and then see the changes I had wrought in their worldviews and personalities play out with each other. When one character who possessed a tremendous faith in the gods had a heated religious argument with another companion I\u2019d steered away from their faith in the first Pillars, it struck me that the dialogue choices I clicked had real consequences. It was this exchange that gave me the sense Obsidian\u2019s writers are on the verge of something truly special with writing these characters and fitting them into its stories. They fall just short in Deadfire, though, with the lack of control afforded to you over the timing of these revelatory moments of character development. Too often, important conversations would begin immediately following another conversation in a way that felt awkward and unrealistic \u2014 or, in the worst cases, right after a major fight when the entire party was severely injured and/or in the midst of a dangerous eldritch dungeon, making a confession of growing affection or a heated debate about metaphysical ethics come off as entirely inappropriate, even humorous. I was left painfully aware that, no matter how artfully it was done, the companion relationship system was still reducing my relationships with my party members to a number that existed outside the context of anything that might be going on.  Those dungeons, islands, and luminous other machines sure look pretty, though. Deadfire is a very, very good looking isometric RPG, presenting a gorgeous fusion of 3D and 2D elements to create memorable scenes of a quality you don't often find in games that use this perspective. The monster design is fantastic, from smooth and oily-looking krakens to the gorgeous and varied elemental dragons. The water textures and lighting are some of the best I've seen in isometric RPGs, and the jungles and deserts are so well done that when my companion character complains about sand getting into unmentionable places, I believe them. I was never jarred out of my enjoyment on entering a new area by low texture quality or a graphical hiccup, which is often an issue in similar engines. Deadfire's pausable real-time combat is its most fun, challenging, and energetic element. Enemy parties and the opponents themselves present almost a puzzle of sorts \u2014 a maze of resistances, proficiencies, and damage types that you and your party must navigate in order to effectively counter them. A key tool in doing so is the single best quality-of-life fix that Deadfire introduces to the established Pillars formula: the extensive AI scripting allowed for each character. Reminiscent of the system from Dragon Age: Origins, you can set up a complex list of AI priorities that ensures that your companions and even your own character respond the way you want them to when a given situation arises in a fight. Though combat can always be paused in order to click from character to character and give orders, battles feel much smoother, and are much more fun, when you can count on your priest to deliver timely healing or your wizard to unleash his most devastating spells you\u2019ve been saving for a tight spot, instead of forgetting to perform said actions and watching a winnable battle end in defeat. Though the scripting does have some notable limitations \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to script a Cipher to build up enough focus for some of their best optional subclass abilities, which seems like a significant oversight \u2014 it adds a new layer of depth to an already smoother, better balanced, and better animated combat system, making each encounter a treat to take on. In many cases, I didn\u2019t mind losing a particularly tough battle because it gave me the chance to make any number of tweaks to strategy, scripting, and loadout in an effort to alter the outcome. Replaying a tough boss battle became less a chore and more of a charm."

Perhaps I was too distracted by its countless audio dropouts, freezes, broken controller inputs and baffling enemy behaviours to really be able to concentrate on straightening out the tangled threads of its nonlinear narrative. If nothing else, Remothered: Broken Porcelain is aptly named; like a shattered vase it lacks structure, each individual part is rough around the edges, and it\u2019s not really worth the effort to try and piece them all together.  At the very least the setting is an appropriately haunting one. Ashmann Inn is an antiquated hotel situated in a secluded snowy mountain region highly reminiscent of Stephen King\u2019s The Shining. Certainly during its opening moments I enjoyed the eerie ambience of its dimly lit hallways as I, controlling the young protagonist Jennifer, indulged in a deadly game of hide and seek with the murderous, mind-controlled hotel maid Andrea (seemingly modelled on Annie from Stephen King\u2019s Misery). Remothered: Broken Porcelain Review Screenshots 6 Images But that enjoyment was about as short-lived as Stephen King\u2019s career as a film director, because Remothered: Broken Porcelain simply can\u2019t sustain the same level of cat and mouse tension that the original game could. This is largely due to Jennifer\u2019s movement speed which is positively glacial in comparison to the swift gait of each enemy stalker. By the time you\u2019ve slowly crouch-walked your way up behind one, they\u2019ve already read a book, made a sandwich, and turned around and spotted you before the stealth attack prompt has managed to materialise over their head. Since attacking enemies from behind is your sole combat option for the most part, once detected your only course of action is to flee and hide until they\u2019re no longer on high alert. This can also be problematic, as seen by the many times I went to hop into a locker and the \u2018open locker\u2019 button prompt failed to appear, resulting in me frantically shuffling back and forth trying to find it before copping the wrong end of a pair of sewing scissors in the jugular. The supernatural sensitivity of the enemy AI versus your own sluggishness and unreliable inputs doesn\u2019t make for a fun stealth experience, just a frustrating one that made each area of Remothered: Broken Porcelain a chore to complete.  A Bug\u2019s Life  Outside of these cumbersome enemy encounters, there\u2019s surprisingly little else to do in Remothered: Broken Porcelain. There are significantly fewer environmental puzzles to solve than there were in Tormented Fathers, with only the occasional cracking of a safe combination to demand much in the way of lateral thought. Instead, Remothered: Broken Porcelain places an emphasis on Jennifer\u2019s ability to temporarily teleport her consciousness into a moth and fly up to out of reach items or, in one instance, agitate a guard dog enough for Jennifer to slip by. It\u2019s an interesting concept, but there\u2019s no real scope for employing it outside of very specific story junctures, and when you do get to use it it\u2019s like trying to pilot a remote-controlled drone through a room submerged in honey. The moth\u2019s movements are seriously listless and it has a tendency to get stuck on parts of the environment. And since it can only be used in short bursts I\u2019d often find myself switching to moth form, getting stuck in a wall on the way to my target, being beamed back to Jennifer, and then forced to wait for a cooldown timer to recharge before I could start the process over again.  Jennifer\u2019s moth ability might not be much fun to use, but at least it\u2019s one bug that\u2019s actually been included on purpose. \u201c Jennifer\u2019s moth ability might not be much fun to use, but at least it\u2019s one bug that\u2019s actually been included on purpose. Elsewhere there are far too many game-breaking glitches to count. Aside from the aforementioned button prompts failing to appear when you\u2019re trying to hide, there\u2019s dialogue and ambient audio cutting in and out, characters getting stuck in scenery, game crashes, enemy stalkers pinning you between their body and the environment, confusing camera quirks, and more. It took me about 10 hours to complete my playthrough of Remothered: Broken Porcelain, but I\u2019d estimate that at least a couple of those hours were a direct result of failing objectives due to glitches and retreading stretches after forced restarts. To developer Stormind Games\u2019 credit, there has already been an effort to rectify many of these flaws \u2013 at the time of writing (some 48 hours after launch) there have already been three patches deployed for Remothered: Broken Porcelain\u2019s PC version.

The plot jarringly shunts forwards and backwards in time while being only loosely connected by cutscenes that end far too abruptly. The only shining light as far as the story is concerned are the handful of playable flashbacks that centre around Jennifer and her best friend Linn.

While there is no official confirmation as of this writing, it is highly likely that this will be the final episode of Telltale's The Walking Dead, even though a four-episode run had initially been announced.]  Halfway through the second episode of The Walking Dead\u2019s final season, I found myself frustrated. I had been playing for about an hour but still struggled to care about any character other than Clementine or AJ, any actions I took, or any dialogue choice I was presented with. It all felt hollow and lifeless, a formulaic Mad Libs-esque construction in which story elements were strung together in a repetitive, predictable sequence. If anything can be said for Episode Two, it\u2019s this: the seams of this series are showing, and they\u2019re beginning to wear thin.  As in previous episodes and seasons of The Walking Dead, Clementine and her relationship with AJ continues to be the strongest and most compelling part of the story. After dealing with a particularly traumatic incident at the end of the previous episode, Clementine is left to put the pieces back together and teach AJ more difficult lessons about the subtleties and nuances of life from a time when manners and niceties were socially relevant.   The blunt and confused nature of AJ\u2019s dialog feels very authentic to the way children normally speak in its ability to withhold nothing and bluntly address a topic on their immature minds. He asks Clementine why people bother having funerals, why people should care about remembering the lives of so-called \u201cmonsters,\u201d why it\u2019s okay to kill in some instances but not in others, and, in one particularly wrenching moment, whether or not they\u2019ll even continue to survive.  The rest of the supporting cast struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. \u201c Clementine\u2019s reactions are mostly genuine and well-executed. His questions hit a note deeper in her, forcing her to reconsider her beliefs and whether or not they\u2019re still necessary in this deceased world. It\u2019s a familiar sensation for anyone who has been asked an unintentionally devastating existential question by a child, and Clementine and AJ\u2019s interactions and reliance on each other remain a very solid backbone on which this season is built.  However, the rest of the supporting cast and storyline struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. This entire episode made one jarring logical leap after another, relying on the emotions and interactions of characters I barely knew to carry the drama and tension throughout, and that simply didn\u2019t work.   One particularly egregious moment happened when the other kids grew upset with AJ for an action that seemed to be reasonable and appropriate given the circumstance. Despite monumental evidence to support AJ\u2019s decision, a handful of characters instead doubled down on their irrational hatred of him, which made them even harder to identify with.  Telltale hasn\u2019t done the work of establishing motivations. \u201c It\u2019s in moments like this where the formulaic nature of The Walking Dead\u2019s storytelling begins to show. It feels templatized; time and time again, one character is inserted as the antagonist, while another stands up for Clem and AJ. Then Clementine has to choose how she reacts and is either rewarded or punished, depending on how that dialogue choice is received. That can work when characters have rational reasons to believe what they do, but here Telltale hasn\u2019t done the work of establishing their motivations, so characters instead feel like they\u2019re going through the motions for the sake of continuing the plot.  At a pivotal moment, AJ and Clementine are forced to take to the road by themselves. This goes predictably poorly and results in a contrived reunion between Clementine and a familiar face from seasons past, but their behavior here feels wildly out of character. Drama ensues, and AJ and Clem return to the compound as though they\u2019d never left, which makes no sense given the circumstances of their departure earlier in this same episode.   Moments like these were especially jarring because they don\u2019t line up with the logic the series has established (namely \u201cThis person will remember that\u201d), and they negate all of the decisions and consequences made up to this point. More characters materialized who, prior to these moments, had not been an important focus for the story but suddenly became relevant to serve as plot vehicles in their very specific place within the plot\u2019s formula.  One strong moment in the episode focused on Clementine\u2019s romance with either a female or male character in the gang of kids. This kind of interaction is a first for the Walking Dead series, and the scene in which it plays out is sweet and well-executed. It\u2019s exactly what a story like this needs: a moment of true levity in which characters have an organic interaction not tethered to the typical hopeless tropes and cliches often found within end-of-the-world stories.  Gameplay felt especially slow and plodding, with brief moments of very basic action sequences mixed in with pixel-hunting around washed-out environments to collect items. Some of it works, and some of it feels frustratingly laggy and not at all satisfying. Ranged weapons are unsatisfying to use, the precise timing of quick-time events doesn\u2019t always feel clear, and even moving around in environments is laborious. It feels old and stale, like many of the mechanics have been placed merely out of obligation to The Walking Dead\u2019s broader established formula instead of enhancing the overall experience."

Developer Red Candle Games is attempting to restore it but does not know if or when it will return.] Some horror games offer little more than cheap jump-scares and buckets of gore, but Devotion is the kind of psychological horror with the potential to keep you thinking for weeks after you've beaten it. It's expertly-paced and doesn\u2019t stick around long enough for its mechanical simplicity to overstay its welcome, but in that three hours delivers a powerfully unsettling story. And it does it all without ever having a single fully animated character on screen for more than a few seconds. In Devotion, you take on the role of screenwriter Du Feng Yu as he experiences a surreal journey through the past in order to unravel the threads of what happened to his wife and daughter. Similar to other first-person horror games, like P.T., Devotion mostly takes place in the family\u2019s modest apartment home. It\u2019s a choice of setting that makes room for excellent character development as you discover mementos and items across multiple years within the home, effectively telling the family\u2019s story.  Devotion\u2019s story is so good and full of so much powerful imagery that it\u2019s easy to overlook its claustrophobic environment and simple design. The designers at Red Candle Games have a fine understanding of not only pacing but the importance of keeping horror elements measured and deliberate. There is only one section where you can actually lose, so most of the horror is less about trying not to die and being forced to replay sections and more about twisted imagery, defiled innocence, and profoundly sad moments. Watching a small girl sob before turning into a possessed doll or seeing blood drip from eyeballs dangling from the ceiling is the stuff of nightmares, and it\u2019s conveyed with a potent creepiness thanks to noticeably passionate voice acting and great use of both ominously atmospheric sounds and low, rumbling background noises. The family home is established as not only a physical place to explore, but also as a metaphor for Du Feng Yu and his family as a whole. As the years progress and you get deeper into Devotion, elements of the apartment become far more troublesome and sinister. The once cleanly organized living room becomes disheveled with religious altars erected and ominous lights hanging from the ceiling. The daughter\u2019s adorable bedroom morphs into a storage place for piles of books. The photos of the wife suddenly have her eyes gouged out. There is zero wasted space here. \u201c There is so much nuance here that the apartment never really feels like the same location between the different time periods you visit. If anything, noticing the subtle changes in the environment and how it helps tell the story in a more poignant way is a huge part of why Devotion is so effective. Every interactable item, puzzle, horrific scene, and piece of dialogue is directly tied back into the plot to further the story or add to a character\u2019s background. There is zero wasted space here. For example, a blurry photograph might seem trivial when you first come across it, but paying attention to details like this one is crucial in solving puzzles from different eras. I found myself digging into the menus to re-read notes, scribbles on photographs, and other clues to figure out puzzles. From poems and love letters to depressing diary entries, there is a surprising amount of exposition delivered through items in the game world.  For all the clever ways it keeps you engaged with Devotion\u2019s environmental storytelling, emotional flashbacks, and powerful anecdotes, the actual mechanical act of playing is relatively unimpressive and boring. You basically just walk into a room, inspect anything that has a dot on it in your UI, and move on. Like in an old-school point-and-click adventure, if an item is added to your inventory then you know it\u2019s needed to solve a puzzle somewhere else, like having to play a record in a record player. Likewise, the somewhat-obtuse puzzles combined with an often agonizingly slow walking speed (there\u2019s no run button) made Devotion feel a lot longer than it actually was \u2013 but maybe that was part of the point. Since almost nothing is actually as simple as it seems, everything from the way it\u2019s played to the long corridors and lethargic movement feed back into the metaphor of a slow mental decay. However, it caused a bit of actual mental anguish in that even though you can freely move between time periods you\u2019ve already been to, to do so you have to leave the apartment, wait at a loading screen, go back to the lobby, and enter the correct era\u2019s apartment. In a lot of ways, Devotion is less of a horror game and more of a detective story. \u201c In a lot of ways, Devotion is less of a horror game and more of a detective story. Not until the very end do all the pieces really fall into place of exactly what\u2019s going on and, if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll probably have a few satisfying \u201cA-ha!\u201d moments along the way. My best word of advice would be to pay attention to every detail and hopefully remember where things are located and in which time period. I got stuck a couple times and it was usually just because I couldn\u2019t remember if an item was in 1980, 1985, or 1986 and spent a lot of time retracing my steps. There are only a handful of jump scares throughout Devotion, but when they do hit they usually hit very hard thanks to their intensity and the suffocating silence that precedes and follows each of them. And the select few instances of gore are so subdued, yet effective, it made me feel squeamish in ways that the overused ultra-violence of a game like Agony never could."

It surprisingly succeeds, thanks to great writing, solid tactics, and some very clever design decisions that emphasize how adventure is all about legacy. It may not look like much at a glance, but anyone interested in good stories in games should look deeper. The grand dream of the role-playing game is combining the flexibility and creativity of having a human game master who can react to player decisions and tell stories with the speed and convenience of playing single-player on a computer or console. It's a pursuit that has led to some of the great innovations in the genre, like early BioWare's development of fully fleshed-out companions or Fallout's responsiveness to our choices. Wildermyth Screenshots 9 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask It's also a dream that can never be achieved (barring some terrifying breakthrough in AI), but that makes the ambitious attempts all the more exciting when they make baby steps of progress. Worldwalker Games' story-centered tactical RPG Wildermyth is as ambitious as games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker or Alpha Protocol \u2013 but with far fewer glaring flaws to look past. It's one of those games that captures that lightning in a bottle. Roll, Heroes, Roll Describing Wildermyth in broad strokes can make it sound like a conventional RPG. First, you pick from one of a small set of campaigns, which can either be randomly generated or have a pre-written main plot. This opens with a party of three or four randomized or customizable characters being launched on the path to adventure. These origin stories are usually well-told; the intro in the tutorial with the character who became my spellcasting Mystic, Fern, reading a book and then having that book become part of her life stuck with me through the entire campaign and beyond. After that, they pick their classes, learn to fight, and roll into the main campaign map. Wildermyth is one of those games that captures that lightning in a bottle. \u201c There's then a rhythm of exploring a new zone, participating in a randomly selected and procedurally flexible short story that develops the characters and the world, a combat mission assaulting the enemies you find there, and then consolidation of your gains in a way that grants the party upgrades. After enough of those, it's back to a plot mission to the end chapter. This campaign structure is a solid, if occasionally repetitive foundation for a game \u2013 and that repetition is probably my single biggest criticism of Wildermyth. But it\u2019s mitigated by several exceptionally clever and well-crafted elements of the overall design. The Best Modern RPGs 11 Images The first of these is that the writing is, well, really good. Each section of the story is told with a little comic book-style cutscene, and Wildermyth uses those creatively to grant the illusion of movement. In a touch that reminded me of the way Metal Gear Solid 5 starts its levels by crediting the designer, Wildermyth includes a title screen for each short story that includes the author\u2019s name. These vignettes can range from the somewhat generic for setting up a fight \u2013 a character falls down a hole and the other party members have to decide how to save her \u2013 to the intensely mythic, like a mysterious giant shape passing in the night, granting the party a reputation bonus simply for being able to tell the story of what happened in bars and at festivals for the rest of their lives. Great Hair, Great Personality More than that, however, the writing is flexible. Each character in your party has three important character traits, like being a dreamer or a weirdo or having potential or carrying a lot of shame. These personality traits are used in stories in ways that have the characters reacting to events in the proper ways, and some stories seem to be set up to only pop up when characters of specific traits are in the party. The presence of certain traits means that even when you\u2019re seeing the same stories multiple times, they can feel different based on which characters are involved. Personality traits are used in stories in ways that have the characters reacting to events in the proper ways. \u201c Another fun effect is occasional character transformations as campaigns progress. I've had characters grow wings from meeting capricious wanderers, start turning into gemstones based on their greed, or commune with a fire spirit and have their body start to turn to flame. Character relationships are important, too \u2013 those default to friendship, but Wildermyth can toss some familial relationships at you, and either your choices or random events can lead to romantic entanglements or rivalries, both of which add some fun storytelling spice beyond the preset traits. That spice isn't just in the plot, though. Both of those possibilities grant tactical buffs: rivalries cause pairs of characters to inflict more critical hits (called Stunts in Wildermyth's system) as the two compete in battle like Gimli and Legolas, while romances mean characters deal extra damage after their lover gets hit. Transformations have neat effects too, both adjusting the party member's stats and giving them exciting skills, like my flame-handed Mystic having the ability to shoot streams of fire from her hands at will.

Some of this is stylistic; Wildermyth uses a flexible paper doll system for its character models, kind of like a less grimdark Darkest Dungeon , and each face can age, get magically corrupted, or become scarred if characters are defeated in combat. Each body can be customized for height, size, gender and presentation, hair, face, and colors in a surprisingly effective manner given the apparent simplicity of the art style. And the cartoonishly exaggerated items like magical swords or spiked shoulderpads you find along your quest all tend to pop up remarkably nicely, even on the combat screen. It can take a bit to get used to (and paper dolls\u2019 heads tilting to look up never quite works), but it's a very clever way for an indie game to grant the illusion of having the resources to let you do whatever you want with your party members. Over the course of a campaign, which is probably about 10-15 hours depending on difficulty, your characters will evolve from looking like some peasants who picked up the most convenient items at hand to defend themselves, to a tough soldier or hunter, to a legendary hero of yore, with billowing capes, colorful armor, magical body modifications, and unique mythic bows or axes. They\u2019ll find themselves fighting alongside similarly decked-out best friends or husbands or children, all for the fate of the world. The progression feels natural, like an RPG should feel, and that goes a long way. Character progression feels natural, like an RPG should feel, and that goes a long way. \u201c It's a rare game where I'd barely mention combat until this late in a review, but Wildermyth is a very rare game indeed. Its turn-based tactical RPG battles feel perfunctory initially; playing the tutorial campaign on default difficulty tends to involve little more than moving to a monster, hitting it, and not overextending in order to win. But as I played longer campaigns \u2013 and increased the difficulty \u2013 I found a surprising depth emerging from Wildermyth. One extremely clever aspect of the campaigns is that after every combat, yes, your characters improve thanks to experience\u2026 but so do the monsters. A card that gets drawn could add a new more powerful enemy to future battles, or increase the health or armor or damage of an existing foe. As my campaigns progressed, so too did those enemy buffs, in ways that could cascade somewhat out of control. This, combined with tough-but-fair higher difficulties, meant my autopiloting through combat was replaced by intensely tactical battles. One fight saw my team caught between two large sets of enemies on a town street; it was only a tactical retreat into the nearest building with my best character, a Warrior, in the front, and my fire Mystic tossing dancing flames around that gave me a chance to get out without losing characters. I had gone into Wildermyth as though it were a game where the combat largely existed to help pace a storytelling experience \u2013 and it can be that if that's what you want \u2013 but it becomes a strong tactical RPG on its own if you ask it to dance. Get Off My Lawn Surprising depth is the name of the game on the plot side as well, with two major conceits providing the rugs that tie the room together. The first is time. Each campaign is divided into several chapters, and those chapters take place years apart. Both within and in between those chapters, characters age and time passes. It's a similar conceit to Double Fine's generation-based Massive Chalice, but with far more complexity and nuance between fights. The Shadow of Darklands As I played Wildermyth, the game that kept popping into my mind as one of its closest parallels was 1992's Darklands , arguably the biggest ambitious failure in CRPG history (though it's available on GOG ). Like Darklands, Wildermyth involves generations of heroes meandering through dense worlds, building reputations and having stories come from the world responding to our choices. There are differences, notably Wildermyth's more traditional setting and reputation being built in-party, but it scratches the same itches that the idea of Darklands always did for me. Play the first chapter and your fresh-faced youngsters will learn and grow a bit, but by the second chapter a decade may have passed and they\u2019re getting some salt-and-pepper in their hair and a few wrinkles to distinguish them. Another chapter later and they're married with children and ennui about adventuring. They can die, get maimed, or retire during story events \u2013 I had one character become a seer who prevented future enemy invasions, but that came at the cost of losing her from my party. And as the campaign draws to its end, they'll often retire and let the next generation take over \u2013 although you can make some decisions or build stats that let them stick around longer than normal. Aging creates a double-edged sword in a Wildermyth campaign. \u201c The aging creates a double-edged sword in a Wildermyth campaign: playing as a completionist makes your characters stronger, but it also makes them older and more likely to retire when you need them most. It also ties into that visual sense of progress. Yeah, Fern is looking cooler and cooler, and those gray hairs make her look like Rogue from the X-Men, and her entire body is turning to flame, but she may hang it all up after this chapter! This is a tension that could create a certain level of decision fatigue, but Wildermyth has one final trick up its sleeve. It\u2019s a meta-concept that doesn't just make everything work, it makes it work brilliantly. The Legend Continues See, Wildermyth is all about legacy . It's about stories and the knowledge that those stories may or may not be true, but they'll ring through the generations regardless. The interface is built around the idea of books, of telling and retelling. Books and libraries and oral history are crucial to many of the cutscenes, starting with that tutorial character getting her powers directly from reading a book. The characters realize they're in stories, in a sense, but in a way that makes it feel more mythic (most of the time, at least \u2013 occasionally an easy joke slips through). It\u2019s telling that the main currency in the campaign isn't gold or some monetary stand-in, it's \"Legacy Points,\" which can be spent on recruiting new characters or buying materials for gear upgrades or preventing enemy buffs. More importantly, characters who retire or finish a campaign aren't simply done: they become part of \"My Legacy,\" a sort of trophy rack of characters for both examination and for further use. Characters who die can also be buried in tombs that add them to your Legacy as well \u2013 I had one character I\u2019d gone through a long quest to recruit who\u2019d died quickly after, but his daughter showed up 20 years later. She eventually died as well, but she was so cool and the story around her was enticing enough that I added her to the Legacy, and now Yovanna Slenderskirt is a character who pops up in my stories again and again. That's right: Legacy characters can and will be pulled from that rack to play a role in other campaigns. Their levels are lowered a bit so they're not overpowered, and they can be de-aged depending on campaign need, but it\u2019s definitely still them. That's right: Legacy characters can and will be pulled from that rack to play a role in other campaigns. \u201c The Legacy characters also feel mythic. That sense of progress in gear and their individual storylines tying together makes them look and feel cooler than the newly generated characters of any campaign. They're given terms like \"Folk Hero\" or \"Local Legend,\" and it rings true \u2013 not just in how they're slightly more powerful in a tactical sense, but also in how their stories change a bit every time. In the tutorial campaign, my lead Warrior, Wynbrec, was a boisterous friend to the main characters; in the next campaign he popped up in, he's an expert warrior where that boisterousness makes him seem like kind of a jerk to the kids he ends up befriending. He was a fun sidekick when I didn't already know him, but became an inscrutable wanderer once he'd developed a reputation. This lack of canonicity to the storytelling, the elevated, legendary tone of the stories, and the effects of time, choice, and gear on the character models all add up to your Legacy characters feeling less like straightforward regular people within the game world, and more like folk heroes like Johnny Appleseed or Wong Fei-hung , or superheroes like Batman. It matches how I see people talk about their procedural characters in games like XCOM or Darkest Dungeon. Wynbrec isn't just \"a warrior who can attack twice per turn,\" he's my first Warrior, the guy who defended a barn in his hometown against a horde of giant insects and befriended a critter who stole his lucky coin. Everyone in my game world should have stories about Wynbrec, even if they contradict one another! He rules!"

There\u2019s a magical moment when characters \u2013 both mortals and the gods of Greek myth \u2013 burst into song and you can choose your response, which impacts how your character feels, affects how other people respond, and even changes the lyrics of the tune you\u2019re helping create.

Every line is voiced, often by recognizable talent.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask For such a fantastical story, though, I was a bit underwhelmed by the overly safe interpretation of the characters. If you\u2019re going to explore Greek mythology, I want to see something new done with characters like Athena, Pan, and Persephone; I want to be enchanted by discovering new sides to these gods and to their established storylines. There are a few of those surprises here: Baker\u2019s Apollo, for instance, is far moodier than the way the God of the Sun is usually portrayed, and I did enjoy his surfer bro backstory. But for the most part, this pantheon sticks a bit too comfortably close to the archetypes they\u2019re traditionally presented as. Disclosure: Humble Bundle is owned by Ziff Davis, the parent company of IGN. Humble Bundle and IGN operate completely independently, and no special consideration is given to Humble Bundle announcements or promotions for coverage. Part of that is due to the fact that a playthrough of Stray Gods takes only about three hours, so by necessity the writing (which was led by BioWare veteran David Gaider) sacrifices character development for plot acceleration, for the most part. You can catch characters at a bar or party and briefly speak to them, but the overarching goal is always to find the murder suspect and clear your name. The few dialogue choices that do build out the lives of these characters are just optional lines that you can skip through as you complete the main quest. The art, though, is absolutely fantastic. The hand-drawn characters look distinctive and vivid, in bold lines and fashion choices. A number of the gods have edgy piercings and other accessories that give them an extra layer of personality that matches their writing and voice performances. The color schemes of the backdrops, whether it\u2019s a lair or a luxury apartment, are also a feast for the eyes. What's your favorite original song from a video game? Still Alive - Portal We All Become - Transistor A Pirate I Was Meant to Be - The Curse of Monkey Island The Dragonborn Comes - Skyrim Baba Yetu - Civilization IV Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results Maybe this is just a pet peeve, but it did bother me that the characters\u2019 lips don\u2019t move at all \u2013 and while that\u2019s fairly typical for a visual novel, most visual novels aren\u2019t musicals. At times, the characters have their mouths closed while their songs play, which served to take me out of the illusion that they were really singing. To their credit, the varied camera angles do keep the flow of each scene going. While the murder mystery plot\u2019s true culprit was a little too obvious for my taste, and that never changes, there\u2019s potential for replayability in that Grace\u2019s dialogue options are guided by whether you\u2019ve chosen to play her as Clever, Charismatic, or Kickass, and that decision makes scenes play out very differently. A Kickass Grace will aggressively shake down a suspect, whereas a Clever Grace would reason with her adversaries and try to make them see logic. As a positive, the gameplay is extremely simple and accessible, to the point where it feels like an interactive TV special. You\u2019re mostly looking around places for clues and deciding if you want to charm, interrogate, or sneak past other characters or obstacles. You can choose violence\u2026 or you can be more subtle. You select Grace\u2019s dialogue choices, and during tense song battles, these choices are timed \u2013 though it\u2019s still low-stakes in that there are no real consequences if you fail to make a choice in time \u2013 it simply picks one for you. I find myself replaying to see if I can date other characters (usually you can). \u201c I find myself replaying to see if I can date other characters (usually you can, unrestricted by gender) and to spend more time with characters I\u2019d bypassed on the first run. And the only technical issues I ran into were occasional failures to save my progress. Even someone who has never picked up a video game before could, in theory, enjoy  Stray Gods. Stray Gods\u2019 original songs could fit right into a Broadway show. Scored by acclaimed game composer Austin Wintory, they\u2019re lengthy and are aimed at giving us a sense of who these characters are as they contemplate mortality, reflect on the bitterness of the past, and vent their emotions. The very talented voice actors show off their impressive range and deliver heartfelt performances. It can get quite heavy, and I found myself wondering if these songs might reflect the feelings of some of my own relatives who are nearing the end of their lives. However, they\u2019re written without much of a pop hook; as a result, they\u2019re not very catchy. But upon a second playthrough, I could hear recurring themes and character accents, and they certainly have their moments. At one point, Grace switches over to a Hamilton-like delivery, belting out insults against her opponents in a rap battle. At another, there\u2019s a quirky cover of \u201cI Put a Spell on You.\u201d A villain\u2019s soliloquy is appropriately devilish. Stray Gods: The Musical Screenshots 9 Images \u201cIt sounds like they hurt you, defied or usurped you,\u201d Grace sings at one point, and that about sums up the vibe. These gods have all been wronged in some way in their thousands of years of being alive. Grace almost has to go around offering them free therapy to comfort them, and I wasn\u2019t necessarily a fan of this approach. One of the draws of video games is that they offer a level of escapism, but Stray Gods dwells on too many sad emotions for me. It just feels a little bleak, especially if I spend too many hours in this world. These gods have all been wronged in some way. \u201c On my first playthrough I allowed every dialogue line to be read in full, and I found that the pacing of the story drags during some of the slower songs when characters ponder their lives and their decisions, such as when Apollo sings about how he\u2019s too passive. You have to sit through those no matter what, but thankfully, there\u2019s an option in the menus to make dialogue skippable if you\u2019d like to make additional playthroughs a breeze.

On a smaller scale, you\u2019re able to change the lyrics of the songs that the characters belt out, and even pick who gets a solo act versus a duet or group performance. You can also choose to make Grace someone who hogs the spotlight, or someone who\u2019s fairly generous with her time. When I first discovered this, I really enjoyed seeing how the songs change, while sticking to an overall melody that still works. Grace\u2019s muse ability to make anyone near her breakout in song means she can also influence their mental health and what they choose to do with their life. Stray Gods doesn\u2019t really address this, but it does open up the question to me, at least: Say you do influence the people around you to do what you want. Doesn\u2019t that strip them of their agency? It\u2019s an idea that Life is Strange: True Colors explores more in depth, and one that would have been fascinating enough to elevate that game from simply being about some characters in a town to being about greater human themes. Instead of digging into this, though, Stray Gods just lets Grace do what she wants, and doesn\u2019t bother worrying about the consequences."

Kingmaker's generic fantasy kingdom is replaced here by the specific story of a crusade against a demon army on the border of the world and the Abyss. Sometimes this is a little off-putting, in that it's easy to miss fighting ogres and goblins in a fantasy game when you\u2019re neck-deep in nabasu and dretch (whatever those are).

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Pathfinder and RPG Sequels In the history of story-focused RPGs, sequels are almost always more complicated and usually more interesting than the original games they follow. The key distinction tends to be that the original games are generalized, proof-of-concept, and the sequels are more specific and specialized, leaning into particular elements of the systems or settings to more fully examine them. (Not to mention general improvements in graphics, balance, and interface.) Knights of the Old Republic was a pure Star Wars heroic adventure, where KOTOR 2 was a darker, more complex deconstruction of what Star Wars mythology means. The first Pillars of Eternity felt like a setting and system in search of a story, while Pillars 2 focusing on the metaphysics of godhood combined with the complications of colonialism made it shine. Mass Effect 2 's companions were infinitely more memorable than the first game (except Wrex, of course) and Fallout New Vegas has a cult following well beyond either the third or fourth installments of that series. Wrath of the Righteous fits firmly and mostly happily in this tradition. Wrath of the Righteous also improves on Kingmaker and other RPGs from the Baldur's Gate family in a few important technical ways. For instance, it's the first isometric game like this I've seen to allow the camera to be spun around the game world, while still looking great from any angle. Even better, the finicky rules-lawyering that made Kingmaker such a pain when it first came out is long-gone, making Wrath welcoming to new players. I've noticed almost no arbitrary punishments for not knowing all of Pathfinder's rules, which was my main problem by far with Kingmaker. It also adds dozens of new character classes and variants, with Cavaliers and Shamans joining the typical Fighters and Clerics. Turn It Up The biggest and best change for the Pathfinder series and for the genre as a whole, however, is that Wrath of the Righteous has a turn-based mode available from the start. The Baldur's Gate or Infinity Engine-style of isometric D&D-based RPG has always been built on a foundation of \"real-time combat with pause,\" where either all your little dudes run at the monsters at once before a few corpses explode and you hope none of them are yours, or you spend half an hour pressing pause on and off trying to manipulate a system into a messy facsimile of turn-based combat in order to have some feeling of control over it. That manner of combat is one of my least favorite in gaming, and it's stood in the way of my enjoyment of a genre that's otherwise made for me. Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity 2 both experimented with turn-based modes, but these were patched in well after release. Wrath of the Righteous is the first major Infinity Engine-stlye game to have a full turn-based mode from the start (and also, because of that, the first of these turn-based modes that I've personally played).

Baldur's Gate Fallout Icewind Dale Wasteland Torment Divinity: Original Sin Pillars of Eternity Pathfinder Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results And it's amazing . The interface switches seamlessly between the two game modes at the press of the T-key, which you can do at any time. Even better, having a legitimately fun turn-based mode makes me care about the occasionally complex systems of the Pathfinder ruleset. Because of this mode, I can focus on actually learning how to break down enemies that have great saving throws or armor classes, for example, or care about the difference between the Searing Ray and Burning Arc spells. The only real downside is that combat encounters which might only take 10 to 30 seconds in real-time mode may take much longer in the slower-paced turn-based mode, which can make an already massive campaign feel even more drawn out \u2013 but that was a small price to pay for me to actually care about combat. Having a legitimately fun turn-based mode makes me care about the occasionally complex systems of the Pathfinder ruleset. \u201c The specificity of Wrath of the Righteous\u2019 setting also helps in that systemic development. As you play the Commander of a grand crusade to defeat the demonic invasion forever, your character isn't just a hero, but a Mythic Hero, who gets granted special powers over the course of the campaign. These can work to accent and dramatically improve existing skills; my barbarian Bloodrager, for example, gained the ability to use her Bloodrage skill as much as she wanted instead of having a cap on it. Meanwhile, I could give my Wizard extra first-level spells and a bonus to ice magic so she could throw dozens of high-damage snowballs at foes. What We Said About Pathfinder: Kingmaker Pathfinder: Kingmaker delivers a fantastic story and a deep character system to dive into. Without a Dungeon Master on the player\u2019s side to smooth out the rough edges however, its balance is wildly inconsistent and its event design, flawed. So many promising ideas fall well short in execution. \u2013 D.M. Schmeyer, October 17, 2018 Score: 6.8 Read the full Pathfinder: Kingmaker review Angels, Demons, and Tricksters The major plot differences between Wrath and other fantasy RPGs also show up in the story side of the Mythic Paths. Based on your ethical choices as the quest starts and your alignment overall, you'll have the option to pick one of several paths, from the somewhat generic good and evil of the Angel and Demon paths, to the freedom-loving Azata that my Chaotic Good character took, to darker paths like becoming a Lich and even resurrecting otherwise dead enemies as new party members. There's a lot of promise in this system and when it works it's great for keeping the plot flexible, but actually understanding how, why, and where you'll have access to those various Mythic Paths can be difficult to parse. As a Chaotic character it feels like I should have had access to the Trickster path, but apparently I'd missed a single dialogue option 10 hours before setting that decision in stone, and so was locked out. There's a lot to recommend about the plot and writing. \u201c Even with that, there's still a lot to recommend about the plot and writing. The overall plot can be fairly conventional with the mostly-good mortals finding off the demonic hordes, but it's given some extra spice when the legendary demonic witch, Areelu Vorlesh, shows up and starts raising complicated questions about free will and morality. The Best Modern RPGs 11 Images I was also particularly impressed with how, when you're given notable choices while adventuring, your party members won't merely chime in but will actually argue with one another in some detail. In one choice I happened to have the naively optimistic Ember and the polite-but-selfish prissy noble Camellia in my party; Ember responded to some clearly over-the-top nastiness by believing that the crusaders in question were just good people trying to do the right thing but making mistakes, and Camellia just tore into Ember's childlike ignorance. More could be done, of course (more could always theoretically be done to have writing for everything in an RPG) but Wrath follows games like Pillars 2 in pushing boundaries. Heavy Lies The Crown Unfortunately, that attention to storytelling and systemic detail is lacking from a major part of Wrath of the Righteous: its crusade management. This is divided into a strategic component of building up the crusade infrastructure and making choices in events, and a wargame of moving armies of crusaders around to reclaim territory from the demon hordes. Both are underwhelming. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Screenshot Gallery 33 Images The strategic layer is very similar to that of Kingmaker, where advisors present you with choices and you also have to develop your capital and forts with buildings. It feels like busywork and also unbalanced \u2013 you rarely have to make an actual difficult decision beyond just waiting for more money or more time. The risk/reward element of Kingmaker having you send different advisors to handle situations in their own unique and possibly wrong way is entirely gone as well, with all of the potential failures channeled over into the army side of things. It's also annoying that going to and from the strategic layer requires going through load screens, a minor problem with the game overall generally but an eye-rollingly annoying one in this mode. Armies move and fight in a very simple turn-based facsimile of a King's Bounty-style tactics game. You recruit units to give your armies different capabilities, such as sorcerors to cast some extra spells, but for the most part combat is a matter of having your generals use the same abilities over and over while your troops just conk enemies on the head for 10 minutes until the battle is won \u2013 then rinse and repeat. It's not terrible, but it\u2019s not especially good, either, and I would genuinely recommend that most people set it to automatic from the options menu. The sheer length of battles and amount of attention it takes can wreak havoc on the campaign pacing. And yeah, that pacing simply has to be mentioned. Wrath of the Righteous is a long, involved game even by the standards of being in the long, involved genre of role-playing games and the specific extra-long, involved type of the retro isometric RPG. I have played probably over 100 hours \u2013 multiple hours every day since release \u2013 and am 3/4s of the way to the level cap but the campaign just keeps going. However, there is depth here to earn that time investment; even beyond playing through the campaign to win, there are different mythic paths to try out, the ability to roll your own parties, and just raising the difficulty for greater challenge. It would be easy to fall into Wrath of the Righteous for months on end, and I say that intending it to be both a recommendation and a warning."

They take you to a mysterious place full of intrigue and the unknown, a place which by the end of your time there you\u2019ve uncovered all of the secrets it held inside. The stunning island setting of Call of the Sea does exactly this as you\u2019re led through each of its puzzle-laden areas, gradually revealing the answers to an engrossing story full to the brim with beauty and darkness. It\u2019s clear from the get-go of this four to five-hour first-person adventure where its inspirations came from. The shadow of Lovecraft hangs heavy over the island, with echoes of other-worldly creatures and pearlescent \u201cThe Colour Out of Space\u201d tones littering the landscape at times. Never does it descend into pure horror, though, and stays firmly put in the more dreamlike elements of the Lovecraftian spectrum, with aspects of Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s work also present. In particular, The Shape of Water appears to have a big influence throughout \u2013 romance, fantasy, and well, water are big themes here. It\u2019s fundamentally about the lengths we\u2019ll go to for the people we love. And like true love, Call of the Sea is reciprocal; the more you invest in its characters and story, the more gratification you\u2019ll ultimately receive when choosing between its equally affecting and poignant endings. The more you invest in its characters and story, the more gratification you\u2019ll ultimately receive. \u201c Call of the Sea is not without a sense of adventure, though, and borrows heavily from the 19th-century novels of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells as you travel to a mysterious location and unearth its history as well as the remnants of an ancient civilization. There\u2019s a genuine feeling of discovery as you follow in the tracks of your character\u2019s explorer husband, Harry. You play as Norah, a woman suffering from an unexplained illness, the cure for which is the reason Harry ventured to the south Pacific in the first place. She\u2019s expertly voiced by Cissy Jones (of Firewatch and The Walking Dead fame) who carries the story on her shoulders for almost all of its runtime with occasional support from Yuri Lowenthal (Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man) as Harry. Similar to Firewatch, Call of the Sea has a personal story to tell with a healthy dose of mystery thrown in. It\u2019s very well written on the whole and concisely tells its story through internal dialogue, letters, and painted murals without ever becoming confusing or dull. Call of the Sea Xbox Series X Screenshots 8 Images It\u2019s in these internal thoughts, however, that some of the writing doesn\u2019t hold up. It occasionally feels unnatural, with the obvious stated on more than one occasion. It didn\u2019t detract too much from me enjoying the story as a whole, but did at times leave little to interpretation or genuine discovery and what felt like it could\u2019ve been an enticing open mystery sometimes became an expedition in exposition instead. An adventure game is only as good as its puzzles, though, and in this regard Call of the Sea excels. As much as its story and aesthetic influences are clear to see, its gameplay is firmly rooted in classics such as the Myst series. Each chapter tends to have one large puzzle to solve in order to move onto the next area, and it\u2019s surrounded by numerous smaller problems to solve in order to find the main solution. An adventure game is only as good as its puzzles, though, and in this regard Call of the Sea excels. \u201c They start off fairly basic but build in complexity as you move deeper into the heart of the island. Some conundrums share similar mechanics, whether that be translating symbols or pressing a series of disparate buttons in a correct order, but no two are identical. There\u2019s a sense of progression in difficulty that goes hand-in-hand with the story, meaning the puzzles hit a real sweet spot for me and my head felt appropriately scratched. They were never so simple that I felt I wasn\u2019t being challenged, but also never obtuse to the level of me being stumped. This is much appreciated, as with a story-heavy game such as this you never want your momentum to be slowed as you await the next plot developments. It\u2019s a hard thing to balance, but Call of the Sea achieves this throughout. It constantly brings in surprising new mechanics and ways to move around its world. Each new set of puzzles brings a new set of ideas to the table whether on land, or occasionally, underwater. A favourite section of mine had me trying to bring an oversized dormant organ back to life and work out how to play the correct series of musical notes in order to proceed. There\u2019s always a satisfying pay-off to these larger puzzles as well in the form of significant narrative advancements or pure visual spectacle. Each of these areas will have you travelling back and forth between locations in order to do things in the right order. This can become a little laborious over time, as Norah isn\u2019t the fastest walker, and while you can move slightly quicker by \u201crunning\u201d it isn\u2019t enough of a speed boost to ease the pain. If you own an Xbox console do you subscribe to Game Pass?

Each biome houses its own delights, whether that be the tropical tones of a bird-song filled clearing or the harsh crashes of waves set against lightning poetically cannoning off a shipwreck. No two areas feel the same, and indeed not all of them feel of our world, but they\u2019re all attention grabbing in their own ways. The classic look of 1930s posters and postcards is infused into the art style and allows for colours to burst off of the screen. An experience packed with beauty and wonder that hides a dark mystery bubbling beneath its surface. \u201c This paradisiacal setting allows for the more foreboding and unusual architectural and artistic elements of the island to stand out more than they would do in a less naturally tranquil place.

        "Subtitle": "Birds of a Feather ",
        "Content": "Hatoful Boyfriend isn\u2019t about skipping classes on bird watching and making out with your pigeon boyfriend behind the gym. It\u2019s about growth, learning to accept oneself, and pudding. It goes far beyond its silly visual novel/dating simulation facade with its wonderfully written plots, characters, and smart dynamics, though certain game mechanics feel a little arbitrary. 29 Images Your character is a feisty human starting her second year in the most elite all-bird high school, St. PigeoNation\u2019s Institute. Yes, you read that correctly. No, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, but rolling with the absurdity of it is part of the fun. I was relieved I didn\u2019t have to waste time with the first year of school, as the focus wasn\u2019t on my human character\u2019s entrance into the all-bird institution, but was instead on the in-depth stories and relationships she shared with her classmates. If you don\u2019t use the fast-forward button to skip through the text, Hatoful Boyfriend takes a little over an hour to play through. To really complete it, however, requires you to replay multiple times in order to explore the alternate paths of the eight datable birds. This didn\u2019t feel like a burden, because allusions to greater mysteries in other birds\u2019 paths did a great job of encouraging me to replay it well over 10 times. I was intrigued by the potential for numerous endings shown in the gallery, and in mysterious documents in the archive that give little details about the world. Like most dating simulations, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and only requires mouse clicks to progress, but it creatively uses that very simple interaction to build suspense and add to the mood. While one click usually gets you through a sentence or two of dialogue, sometimes only one word or phrase appear with a click. Regrettably, the stats system misses that mark. Wisdom, vitality, and charisma can be leveled up on elective days and through random events, but it\u2019s not immediately apparent how leveling them benefits you. It was a bit annoying that it took me multiple playthroughs to find a benefit to leveling certain stats. No matter your desired path, the beginning of each playthrough begins the same: You enter school, meet the datable birds, and rush through your first term. Though the writing is immensely enjoyable, the first term suffers from pacing issues. I bounced between so many events, it felt like time was passing by too quickly, which seemed like a wasted opportunity for me to get to know each of the birds better before deciding which to pursue. However, once you begin to follow the path of a certain bird, the story becomes more focused. The witty writing embraces Hatoful Boyfriend\u2019s silly concept, using words such as \u201ceverybird\u201d and \u201cnobirdie,\u201d and pokes fun at some birds\u2019 real-world quirks, like the Fantail pigeon\u2019s attraction to shiny things. However, the best part is the characters. Hatoful Boyfriend doesn\u2019t pass up on the stereotypical male roles of a dating sim -- the shy guy, the playful bully, the best friend, and the popular guy, just to name a few -- but it pushes its characters past their stereotypes and led me to care and sympathize with each bird\u2019s story. Surprisingly, it\u2019s not awkward to date the birds. Better yet, the protagonist is just as interesting as the birds she pursues. As a self-proclaimed hunter-gatherer and the only human in the school, it\u2019s fun to learn about her interests and personality as she interacts with the birds. In addition to cute new backgrounds that contrast well against the stock-photo pigeons, the Steam release of Hatoful Boyfriend adds a new scene for the only female bird, Azami. Her personality and path is hilarious.",

        "Content": "Arc System Works has been making great fighting games since I was a teenager (read: a really long time). Both of its flagship franchises -- Guilty Gear and BlazBlue -- have enjoyed a passionate niche following for years. Yet despite having standout visuals and one-of-a-kind play mechanics, they've never caught on the way Capcom's or even SNK's offerings in the genre have. In fact, even amongst hardcore fighting game aficionados, these games and others like them bear something of a scarlet letter on their heads. We call them \u201canime fighters\u201d, a term as useless as it is pointless. Maybe it's the technically demanding fighting engines, or perhaps the cross-dressing nuns, but for whatever reason this sub-genre within a sub-genre has always been forced to stand in the corner. Until now. Enter Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game born from the unlikely collaboration between Arc System Works and the Persona 4 development team at Atlus. And what an entrance it makes. Not only does the game bring unprecedented accessibility to bear while keeping all the high level tournament depth intact, but it does so with an assured swagger that makes it impossible to ignore or forget. This one wasn't meant to sulk in the corner, folks. It was meant to strut on the stage. Above all else, Persona 4 Arena puts on a show, a show that begins with its rock-fueled opening video and ends with paparazzi camera flashes as you stand over the battered body of your opponent. Every screen serves up a feast of audio/visual tastiness that gets stuck to the roof of your mouth. Punky pinks and golden yellows dominate the palette with a crisp glow, accenting menus and interfaces that sport better art direction than some entire games I've played. It's a sheen that few games, 2D or otherwise, can match. The soundtrack manages to meet the high standards set by the visuals with a mix of the hard rock Arc System games are known for and selections from Persona 4's excellent OST. I defy you to refrain from singing along with \u201cReach Out to the Truth\u201d whilst laying down the smack.   That same fusion found in the soundtrack is present throughout the game. While it's in every way a fighter in the same vein as Guilty Gear and BlazBlue, it's also a Persona game through and through. Persona 4's original director, Katsura Hashino, worked with his original team to come up with the script for Arena's story mode, which functions as a canonical sequel to the Persona 4 RPG. This mode is aimed squarely at fans of the series who are more interested in learning the fates of their favorite characters than learning complex combos. You start by choosing one of four Persona users, and as you finish their quests, more and more of the cast becomes available, eventually completing the picture for you. Any fan of the Persona series will be happy with the writing, and some of the plot lines really extend the narrative arcs of their respective characters. Just be ready to spend a lot more time watching than playing. For players with no connection to the story or characters, there's both an Arcade and Versus mode. The former gives you the typical series of fights with bits of dialogue interspersed, and the latter lets you simply fight it out with a buddy or a CPU controlled opponent of your choosing without any story involvement. This is how most straight-up fighting fans will spend their hours with the game. Whether you're a new challenger or a grizzled vet, you can get your learn on in either lesson or training mode. Lesson mode gives you an invaluable breakdown of the game's many systems, and the training mode gives players of every level all the tools they need to practice and theory fight to their heart's content. A fully functional online mode rounds out the package, complete with savable match replays to help you breakdown those tough losses or prove to your friends just how much of a nerd-slaying badass you are. All told, it's the kind of comprehensive feature set I've come to expect from Arc System Works. They may ask full retail for the game, but give you every ounce of value for your dime. To watch or play a fight in Persona 4 Arena is to behold the impossible. \u201c Snazzy visuals drizzled over a heaping pile of bells and whistles is a great start, but at the end of the day you're looking for a good fight, and P4A puts its money where its mouth is in a big way. For all of its flash, it's built strongly on fighting game fundamentals. Unlike many games of its kind, there are a great deal of inputs and attack types that are universal to every character. Air dashes, double jumps, overheads, sweeps, reversals and more are available across the entire cast regardless of their wildly varied play styles. This allows players to have some kind of answer to almost anything their opponent throws at them, even if they only have basic knowledge of their character. You can even do a complete auto-combo for decent damage by pressing the light attack button repeatedly. Sure, it costs you some life and meter to use, but until you learn real combos, it at least gives you a way to get something out of the opportunities you create for yourself.  Check out move lists and more for every character in the Persona 4 Arena Wiki Guide. These mechanics make P4A a much more welcoming game for those new to the genre, but seasoned pros still have a mile high skill ceiling to shoot for. Not one of the 13 playable characters are simple or straightforward in their approach. Each of them has a character specific mechanic as well as a unique Persona \u2013 a manifestation of their other self that can assist them with a wide array of attacks and abilities. Your Persona is like a second character, one that you can position independently on the battlefield. Using it in concert with your main character is key for claiming victory, but you also have to be wary not to expose them, as they can be hit and even temporarily knocked out, leaving you to fight on at half strength for a while. But properly coordinated offensives are a thing of beauty, shaving off a third of your opponents life or more amidst barrages of arcane energy that would look right at home in any RPG."

Australian studio Drop Bear Bytes has designed a classic turn-based RPG set in (you guessed it) a post-apocalyptic Australia, reducing it to an unforgiving desert full of man-eating spiders, raiders, and even bloodthirsty kangaroos. While that setup is a little too familiar, what's supposed to set Broken Roads apart is an intricate morality system alongside its more traditional RPG character sheet. That seems incredibly promising at first, making me look forward to tackling some difficult moral questions \u2013 but after 30 hours of play, it\u2019s clear Broken Roads falls distinctly short of its own goals, to the point it feels somewhat unfinished.

You\u2019ll always end up travelling to the town of Brookton, which is quickly attacked by raiders from a technologically advanced settlement and burned to the ground, and then inexplicably stay with the town\u2019s only survivors instead of going back to wherever you came from. Broken Road\u2019s characters and plot are immediately so paper thin that they\u2019re genuinely difficult to talk about \u2013 you\u2019re introduced to a bunch of people who don\u2019t have much personality other than being hard boiled survivors, and then you essentially become responsible for finding them a new home. Why are you getting involved? Why do a bunch of strangers trust you to make the hard decisions? Party members mostly don\u2019t speak again after their initial introduction, so it\u2019s difficult to tell. Broken Roads even introduces some magical realism later on to keep things interesting, but these plot points aren\u2019t really set up well. The morality system is interesting in theory, but falls pretty flat. \u201c The question at the heart of this story is one many post apocalyptic games ask: who decides who should live and who should die? But Broken Roads just doesn\u2019t have any interesting answers, which is particularly disappointing when an intricate morality system is supposed to be its centrepiece. Where other RPGs are happy to let you choose a rough alignment such as lawful good or neutral evil and call it a day, Broken Roads describes character morality by using actual philosophical principles and gives you a full questionnaire to determine your character\u2019s beliefs. Are you a Nihilist who puts themselves first in any given situation, or are you more of a Humanist who wants the best possible outcome for the largest number of people? That\u2019s interesting in theory, but because you have so little control over what happens, this idea falls pretty flat. Do you think the post-apocalyptic setting in games has been overdone? Yes, I want more variety No, I really enjoy the setting Not yet, but it's starting to get old It depends on how it's done I don't care Answer See Results There are very few conversations involving a moral choice in the first place, and you\u2019re locked out of pretty much all other conversation options once you\u2019ve started down a given alignment path, leaving no opportunities to try something drastically different later. In that way, the hard decisions Broken Roads teases you with are actually pretty straightforward, and the story doesn\u2019t change in any interesting ways from the very few moral choices you can make anyway. For example, you can involve yourself in a town\u2019s elections, but which mayor gets chosen doesn\u2019t have any consequences on the larger events, and isn\u2019t even brought up again in any meaningful way after the fact. One time I even rescued a person only for them to die immediately afterwards, completely without explanation or acknowledgement from any other characters. This could well be a bug, but it\u2019s by no means clear \u2013 sometimes quests fail or resolve themselves if you don\u2019t get to them in time, though these similarly have no effect that I can see on the storyline or your party. I went back a few times to see if different decisions would dramatically change anything, but they largely boiled down to disappointing dialogue differences: do you want to be mean or helpful? Broken Roads didn\u2019t give me enough reasons to care about what I was doing as a result, and when I did make the effort, the rewards were pretty paltry. Broken Roads is often just a long line of fetch quests. \u201c Broken Roads is often just a long line of fetch quests, which doesn\u2019t really make it feel as if you\u2019re fighting for survival in the Outback. It\u2019s also frequently tedious stuff \u2013 in order to infiltrate a community of philosophers, I have to talk to everyone , debate some characters in philosophy, and then scour several cities for a collection of philosophy books before I can proceed. This does make some sense, I\u2019m making an effort in order to befriend a community, after all. It\u2019s just\u2026 not fun to do, and it\u2019s often not clear that you need to complete a random side quest to actually continue with the main task. Sometimes a character will ask me something, but forget important details (for example, exactly how many of a specific item they are actually asking for), leaving me to look it up in the journal. A lot of quests are busy work with no alternative, like exhausting every conversation option with a character. Sometimes, I even had to repeat conversations I already had in order to advance a quest. Broken Roads either tells me exactly where to go, or it tells me nothing at all, and both can be equally frustrating. You can get into fights along the way, though battles happen very rarely either as part of the story (which can mostly be avoided) or as random encounters while travelling the world map (which you can choose to flee from). Combat, which is turn-based in classic RPG fashion, is incredibly frustrating thanks to a very rudimentary UI that makes choosing targets difficult, as well as enemy AI that makes opponents do almost nothing but attack you constantly \u2013 even if they kill their allies or set themselves on fire in the process. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you fight a band of raiders or some angry kangaroos, as these fights play out pretty much the same every time, hampered by slow animations, a lack of enemy variety, bugs, and few really interesting skills to shake things up.

She\u2019s a compassionate, believable protagonist stuck in an ugly sequence of events that\u2019s resistant to change, no matter how hard she tries. That said, this up-and-down three-hour episode betrays a lot of what makes her special. Dark Room is the most inconsistent episode in Life Is Strange so far. The two hours between the excellent prologue and the finale advances the story slowly, and spends most of its time rehashing of what Life Is Strange has already done better before. The story and choices swing wildly from believable lucid to incomprehensible and gross. At times, Dark Room is just plain cheap. Max\u2019s major choices here don\u2019t suit her behavior, or are shocking for the sake of shock value, and that\u2019s really disappointing. It\u2019s a serious tone problem. The fallout from Episode 3, while grim, paves the way for a beautiful look at a friendship Max might have had if things had been different. The new timeline is quickly wiped away and forgotten in a cowardly and convenient cop-out. Life Is Strange quickly ditches its somber best buddies and Blade Runner references theme for a dirtier, scarier Girl With the Dragon Tattoo vibe. I enjoy these things, but they fit together like Thomas Harris writing Nancy Drew. I appreciate the dark, violent underworld Max starts exploring in Dark Room, but it comes at a price. Max and Chloe\u2019s investigation dives deep into her school\u2019s drug problem, the missing Rachel Amber, and how a corrupt local family is connected to it all. It\u2019s a cool string of connected events but it comes together by way of a complicated, poorly explained puzzle. Connecting evidence is tedious, and because Life Is Strange has such low-res textures, it\u2019s even more difficult to piece the right information together. It pays off well, at least. I\u2019m glad the meandering main-plot mystery finally unravels, but that comes at a cost as well. I\u2019m left as intrigued as I am confused as events come to a head in Life Is Strange\u2019s upcoming finale. I have a lot of \u201cWhy?\u201d questions, but they\u2019re the kind that result from poor storytelling, not good mystery setup. Some of them make me want to learn more, but most of them make me wish Dark Room was more sophisticated than its sloppy story was. Click for all episode reviews of the game Life is Strange.",

        "Content": "Kentucky Route Zero: Act 4 opens with a giant, robotic woolly mammoth perched on a boat, and gets stranger from there. The weirdness serves as a valuable storytelling tool, not a gimmick, and is tactfully employed to offset presuppositions we don\u2019t even know we have. Though the imagery is fanciful, it opens the door to this short but excellent adventure game episode\u2019s exploration of truly serious themes: the desperation of poverty, the nature of friendship, and the impending threat of death. A giant mammoth on a boat. In previous Acts, the subterranean journey down Route Zero has felt intrinsically rooted in the hill-and-cave country legacy of the Kentucky highlands: coal mines, distilleries, bad jobs, gospel music, poverty, apocalyptic spirituality, and mystical backwoods folklore wrapped in the twilight of magical realism. These elements are all still present, but Act 4 broadens the scope of the storytelling and embraces the rich, esteemed legacy of literature\u2019s river stories. The journey down the Echo and the striking, somber encounters along the way seem inspired by an Americana as old as Mark Twain. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery and a renewed understanding of their purpose. Though I appreciated the tranquil and maudlin tones of Act 4, it\u2019s the first episode in the series that didn\u2019t scare me. It\u2019s deeply consequential, but the de-emphasis on menace took a little away from the shadowy mystique that penetrates every aspect of the gloriously realized artistic vision. Like Huck and Jim, the Route Zero protagonists follow the endless current toward an unanticipated destination: self-discovery \u201c Playing Kentucky Route Zero is more like writing a novel than reading one. Character background stories are composed on the fly, chosen from a series of wildly divergent dialogue options that define the protagonists\u2019 histories. When someone asked the orphaned boy Ezra if he\u2019d ever been on a boat, I had the choice to define a deep, emotional memory of boats connected to his lost parents, relate a cursory tale about boats in cartoons, or decide that he\u2019d never even been on a boat before. When playing Route Zero, you\u2019re not just choosing where you\u2019re going, you\u2019re also deciding where you\u2019ve come from. This tremendous flexibility feels just as empowering as any climactic action scene or iconic puzzle. There are no bosses to beat or puzzles to solve, but there are very high stakes. The Mucky Mammoth Like previous episodes in Kentucky Route Zero, Act 4 regularly places you in control of multiple characters in the same conversations, constantly shifting your perspective and control in discussions. There\u2019s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene. The clean and simple interface kept this unusual dynamic from becoming confusing, and thanks to a clever script the constantly changing perspectives built up my empathy for the characters. There\u2019s no hard line between player character or NPC party; at any moment you might be asked to change roles in a scene \u201c The carefully crafted dialogue alternates between things people might actually say and a tone more reminiscent of things they\u2019re more likely to think. The effect fits the dreamworld state of the setting very well, but the thickness and constant existential awareness of the text might turn some players off. And then came wonderful, surprising moments where I suddenly lost control of a character and they stepped out (quite literally) on their own, autonomously making decisions that, whether coincidentally or by design, usually lined up with a behavior I would have chosen for them. These moments are few and far between, but when they happened they always made sense and added an air of comedic shock and genuine tragedy to the story. I happily discovered the sparks of independence made Conway and the other characters feel more like people and less like avatars and instruments of my will. Even when I disagreed with their choices, I respected them. Characters standing in the shadows. Act 4 is a short affair, easily completed in a couple of hours, but there\u2019s a surprising amount of variety in the storytelling method during that time. Route Zero is mostly a game about people talking, and Act 4 keeps finding ways to reframe that mechanic. One creative party encounter was experienced entirely as a series of security camera video tapes viewed by people I\u2019d never met, long after my party had passed by. Another was played out in a haunting, beautifully written river-raft tour through a subterranean wildlife preserve, and a third through the playful and thoughtful journeys of a wandering child capturing sounds on a handheld tape recorder. There\u2019s plenty of standard walk and talk, but Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale. Act 4 keeps finding ways to change up the talking and keep things from feeling stale \u201c Every stop along the river has something thoughtful or delightful to offer, but not every encounter is an absolute home run. The concert sequence offered me a chance to get dynamically involved in creating music, but much like Act 3\u2019s interactive song sequence, the musical experiment here feels like it could have come together better with a little more tweaking. All these scenarios and portrayed in a lovely, minimalist graphical style that makes tremendous use of carefully chosen muted colors and shadowing to create a sense of surreality. The camera work is especially well implemented, with constant subtle zooming and panning that brings a sense of life and motion that\u2019s unusual in adventure games. The simulated flatness of the art is so well executed it lulls me into forgetting the characters are moving through a 3D space, and more than once this is startlingly exploited as the perspective twists or zooms to reveal the layered reality of the setting. A roaring prehistoric beast. Thematically, the transition comes at a perfect point in the broader Kentucky Route Zero story, as our heroes begin the chapter in a meandering, listless wandering, and through their encounters along the river, their way toward surrendering to who they are, or changing to become who they want to be. As one character observes: \u201cAll people need is enough to pretend they\u2019re home, and we can make it anywhere.\u201d"
