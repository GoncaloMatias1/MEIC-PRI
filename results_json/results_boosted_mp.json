        "Content": "NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 does a solid job making 2v2 arcade basketball fun for the long haul. Expanding on its predecessor, this sequel \u2013 now under the NBA 2K umbrella \u2013 includes two new major modes that enhance both the solo and multiplayer experiences. While the core gameplay feels very similar to NBA Playgrounds, that\u2019s mostly a good thing. Playgrounds 2 still lacks the depth of the defunct NBA Street series and the pure chaos of the also-dormant NBA Jam, but it has found its footing as a unique take on arcade basketball in its own right.  On the single-player side of the equation, Playgrounds 2 features a season mode, which replaces the six tournaments seen in the original. This isn\u2019t a full-fledged 82-game haul, however. Instead, each season consists of 14 regular season games and a best-of-three playoff format for the top eight teams from each conference. The truncated schedule works well here. You can finish an entire season in under a couple hours with the default game length of three minutes. It\u2019s a refreshing change of pace from the long slog of sports sim seasons. It also gives you the option to play the season cooperatively with a friend via couch co-op or online. Of note, season mode has four difficulty levels, and the AI feels smarter in the sequel, especially when ratcheting up the difficulty.   The season mode directly ties into the card collecting progression system, which makes its return from the original. Winning the championship with each team unlocks a legend. For instance, hoisting the trophy with the Lakers gives you access to Magic Johnson while prevailing with the Cavs gives you Mark Price. Legends often have unique animations that add flair to an already stylish experience.I found myself interested in the season loop even after I won the title with multiple teams. It\u2019s also a good way to level up cards that increase player stats. Currently, I have ongoing seasons with the Celtics, Nuggets, and 76ers. Although it doesn\u2019t really hurt the experience, it\u2019s slightly annoying that you are limited to three save slots and have to delete previous seasons once you fill up all three.  You can spend real money to unlock the whole player collection at once, but, unlike the original, it doesn\u2019t feel necessary. \u201c  Like the original, you have to open card packs to acquire new players. This means that many teams will be inaccessible at first simply due to the fact you won\u2019t have any of their players. Thankfully, you earn enough in-game currency to buy new packs at a fairly fast clip. After each run through a season, I had enough to purchase several packs, each of which contains four players. It also helps that opening duplicate cards doesn\u2019t seem to happen nearly as often in Playgrounds 2. I\u2019ve opened about 20 packs so far, and I\u2019ve only come across two duplicates. You can spend real money to unlock the whole collection at once, but, unlike the original, this doesn\u2019t feel necessary.  Playgrounds 2 has a great mix of current NBA players and legends. It appears that the 2K publishing deal has helped in the legends department as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and numerous other Hall of Fame caliber players are featured in Playgrounds 2. Jordan even has his legendary from the free throw line dunk. Not all teams are evenly represented though. For example, the Lakers have 14 possible cards while the Bulls have nine, the Clippers have seven, and the Wizards have eight. There are several active players on the wrong team. DeMarcus Cousins is on the Pelicans (one of only five Pelicans players by the way), Tony Parker is on the Spurs, Nick Young is on the Warriors, and Isaiah Thomas is on the Lakers.  NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 Screenshots 9 Images  The beefed-up online mode could give Playgrounds 2 some competitive legs if the community is active. Dubbed Playgrounds Championship, it\u2019s ranked play complete with multiple modes, leaderboards, and advanced stats. You can play competitive matches with either a CPU or online teammate (via friend list or matchmaking), or cooperative matches against the CPU with an online teammate. It\u2019s a more expansive online mode than the original and the rankings system could keep you online longer. Though I was only able to find a couple online matches for this review, everything ran smoothly, and I can see myself getting hooked from the rankings system and leaderboards. You can also play the three-point contest in Playgrounds Championship. The contest still feels like a throwaway mode, but at least it does help you work on timing your shots.  It\u2019s easy to grab a controller and score some buckets, but if you want to win on a consistent basis, you have to have skills. \u201c  On the court, Playgrounds 2 cleans up the arcade gameplay a tad, but it plays incredibly similar to the original. The shooting meter has changed from a bar to a semi-circle, though the concept of stopping the timer in the green remains the same. It\u2019s still a challenge to make three-pointers on a consistent basis with low-level players, even for those known for their sharpshooting. If you land outside of the green, it\u2019s an automatic miss. While somewhat unforgiving for an arcade basketball game, it\u2019s also what makes Playgrounds 2 unique. Yes, it\u2019s easy to grab a controller and score some buckets, but if you want to win on a consistent basis, you have to have skills.  Crossover moves are elaborate and over-the-top (cartwheels!) and vary based on player. Dunk and layup animations, the stars of the original, are still ridiculously cool. Even after the twentieth time watching Kevin Love slam home an alley-oop and proceed to do a backflip off the rim, I smiled. It doesn\u2019t take much skill to make your players perform crazy off the glass dunks, but it still feels satisfying nonetheless.   Defense feels a bit more balanced. I had an easier time blocking shots and snagging rebounds than I did in the original. Importantly, the shove button, which still drains your power-up meter, doesn\u2019t feel as cheap. Shoving a ball handler often pries the rock away from their hands, but unless your teammate is right by you, it\u2019s not a sure turnover. On the other hand, swiping at the ball feels more effective, if you time it up right against crossover moves.  The Lottery Picks meter is now represented by a basketball on each of the bottom corners of the screen. Once it\u2019s filled with glowing energy, you get a special ability for a temporary period. The nine boosts include multipliers for dunks and three-point shots, unlimited sprint, and super strength. New to Playgrounds 2 are power-ups that hurt the opposing team. You can inflict a curse on them that lowers their shooting percentage or a sheet of ice that covers the basket so they can\u2019t score. There\u2019s also a change to the lightning power-up. This time, in a nod to NBA Jam, the ball catches on fire, and yes, you will automatically make a full court shot with the fireball. Power-ups can change the momentum of a contest dramatically, but they very rarely feel cheap. Rather, they add an element of unpredictability that makes each trip to the blacktop exciting."

        "Content": "Foamstars has the energy of a Sega Dreamcast game that was made specifically to look good on a quarterly earnings report. With its eclectic soundtrack and sterile-feeling art style, this third-person PvP shooter puts some creative twists on the winning formula coined by Splatoon \u2013 but its commitment to that bubbly theme has a false earnestness to it, weakening its strong foundation with just about every multiplayer monetization trend from the last 10 years. For every clever map design or killer song, there\u2019s a bad voice performance or a cosmetic pack that literally costs more than the price of Foamstars itself. There is still a fun competitive shooter here if you manage to surf deep enough into its sea of foam, but you\u2019ll have to wade past a whole bunch of red flags to find it. As is upsettingly laid out in its brief and painfully easy single-player campaign, you play as a Foamstar: a person who uses their odd ability to excrete a foam-like body fluid to compete in the Foamsmash Tournament, a series of competitive events set in the Las Vegas-inspired city of Bath Vegas. This extremely gross fact is never really explained beyond that, but it does let you cover the ground with bubbly bullets that morph each arena\u2019s topography, allowing you to do cool things like build mounds of foam to get the jump on your opponents or wall them off from an objective. Think Splatoon\u2019s ink, just with the ability to stack it up. Also like Splatoon, your character can move more quickly in the foam by surfing on it, which adds a welcome sense of speed that lets you collaborate with teammates in creative ways. Foamstars Screenshots 9 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Foamstars takes things a step further by weaponizing surfing; once you deal enough damage to chill (not kill) your opponent, they become covered in foam, rendering them nearly immobile before you surf into them to finish the job. On the other hand, if your teammate is foamed up and needs help, you can surf into them to revive them from the brink of death \u2014 or, from being put on ice, that is. This small mechanic makes a world of difference by both encouraging and rewarding aggressive play. Suddenly a foamed-up opponent or teammate becomes a chokepoint to strategize around, especially in the Smash The Star mode, which crowns one person on each team as a Star Player and requires you to take them out while protecting your own. Smash the Star is positioned as Foamstars\u2019 central mode so it\u2019s always available to play, whereas the other two standard options, Happy Bath Survival and Rubber Duck Party, rotate on the hour. Happy Bath Survival is my favorite, and easily the most unique mode Foamstars has to offer: teams split into parties of two, with half of each team facing off against one another in a truncated version of Smash the Star while the leftover pairs from each team lather the map in foam from a perch above the battlefield. Scaling down the deathmatch to a two-on-two confrontation with a longer respawn timer nicely distills the fast-paced fun of Smash the Star into something more focused, yielding white-knuckle showdowns that carry more weight \u2013 but having teammates constantly spraying the battlefield with also foam adds a really fun layer to this mode, as you can use it to disrupt your opponents, play defense, build a tower for your teammates, or just keep the other team from claiming too much turf. A foamed-up opponent becomes a chokepoint to strategize around. \u201c As for Rubber Duck Party, don\u2019t let its deceptively childish name fool you; this is Splatoon\u2019s extremely engaging and highly competitive Tower Control mode down to a T. Blending King of the Hill and Capture the Flag, you and your team need to hold the small area on top of a duck and ride it into your opponents\u2019 base. You need to stand on a small, elevated, and vulnerable area on the duck\u2019s head to capture it, which is a risky point to hold as it exposes you to nearly the entire map and an all-but-certain volley of foam. And if you want to double down on the danger, holding the Circle button on a PS5 controller while your team is in control of the duck lets you do a short dance to boost its speed. While Foamstars doesn\u2019t win any points for originality by copying this mode so closely, it\u2019s still a tried and true classic that\u2019s just as fun here. Unlike Foamstars\u2019 inky predecessor, all three game types are available in its various ranked modes. Also locked behind needless timing constraints, solo and team-based ranked play aren\u2019t both available at the same time, which makes ranking up a confusing dance that hasn\u2019t begun to make sense to me even after hours in the ranked queue. For example, your ranking in each placement match doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with your individual performance, but your team\u2019s as a whole. In matches where we lost (sometimes thanks to AFK players), my performance was arbitrarily rated low despite leading my team in playing the objective. Wins, on the other hand, all won me the same rating regardless of whether I was carried by a teammate or led the lobby in chills. It\u2019s all frustrating as a result, making me less inclined to try and grind my way up its ladder. How disturbed are you to learn that the foam in Foamstars is a body fluid they excrete? Extremely, I am going to have nightmares It is pretty weird, yeah I guess if that's the lore it's fine? I think it's cool/funny! Answer See Results Rather than having a large pool of maps that get slightly reworked based on whatever mode you\u2019re playing, each mode has its own set of unique maps, which is as much in Foamstars\u2019 favor as it is a drag. On the one hand, it guarantees that every match takes place in an environment designed specifically around that mode\u2019s mechanics \u2013 for example, the map Fusion Coaster Kingdom the rubber ducky you need to capture on a tall roller coaster track, forcing you to get creative with your platforming if you want to take the advantage or get the jump on the other team. But on the other hand, there are only three or four maps available for each mode, and that small handful of options means they can get stale pretty quickly. Some of Foamstars\u2019 bigger maps feel sparse by comparison, too. Wide lanes and open spaces overestimate just how quickly foam can stack up when foaming the ground isn\u2019t part of the objective, making the middle of many maps like Aqua Blast Adventures into a no-mans-land rather than a foamy battlefield. Foamstars\u2019 roster of eight unique characters is also disappointingly slim, though each of them at least has distinct strengths and weaknesses that add diversity to the lineup and cater to different playstyles. Soa, Foamstars\u2019 pop idol mascot, has some strong mobility thanks to an ability that lets her perform a jump that doubles as a dodge, allowing her to safely make aggressive plays. Tonix, on the other hand, isn\u2019t as mobile but she can put down a lot of foam to help her teammates by creating better vantage points and even set turrets to back them up. My favorite so far is \u0394GITO (yes, his name has a triangle in it), who is a shark-obsessed \u201cPro-Gamer\u201d with a shotgun-like bubble blaster and a movement-friendly special ability that rewards you for going for chills. The monetization would feel pretty brazen even for a free-to-play game. \u201c If you aren\u2019t interested in grinding out PvP matches, you can also take on missions to save Bath Vegas from an onslaught of foamy baddies with up to three other players in what generally boils down to a shooting gallery-like horde mode. Interestingly, the multiplayer version of these missions adds roguelike progression between rounds, which allows you to build around your character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in some highly satisfying ways that make you feel like you\u2019re breaking its systems while still facing a challenge. Despite its extremely straightforward setup, with wave after wave of enemies flying at you on the same boring square arena without any change beyond the foam you and your teammates lay down, the multiplayer version is surprisingly satisfying to fight your way through. The same can\u2019t be said about the single-player version, which acts as Foamstars\u2019 story mode and is so easy I thought I might\u2019ve accidentally missed a difficulty setting somewhere in Foamstars\u2019 slow menus. No matter the mode, playing matches provides you with experience points, which fill up Foamstars\u2019 modestly-priced $6 (USD) battle pass. This doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel as far as online multiplayer games go, rewarding your time with premium content restricted to cosmetics only \u2013 except, that is, for each season\u2019s new character, which you\u2019ll need to slowly unlock as you play if you don\u2019t buy the battle pass to get them right away. The pass features a handful of exclusive skins for each Foamstar, emotes, weapon and surfboard wraps, and \u201cparty poppers\u201d that are used to boost your experience gain in a match. It\u2019s generally fairly standard stuff, but there\u2019s also no premium currency in it that you could put toward the next season\u2019s pass like many games have, so we\u2019ll probably end up having to pay piecemeal for each new season as they come. That\u2019s an aggressive tactic that would feel pretty brazen even for completely free-to-play games, let alone one with a price tag. But the bulk of Foamstars\u2019 cosmetics come from outside the battle pass, and instead of being walled behind an in-game currency that you can earn as you play (or even through the battle pass), nearly every cosmetic unlock costs real money. Where some are an annoying but reasonable enough $4, far too many of the items in the shop are absurdly priced, with several item sets clocking in at a gut-checking $45. Adding insult to costly injury, few of them are cool or interesting beyond a new skin that isn\u2019t just a palette swap, like giving Jet Justice a space suit. Even still, surfing around Foamstars\u2019 energetic fights can be a blast, and its foam mechanics add a fascinating level of variability to each map. It\u2019s just hard to reconcile the good parts of that frantic, bubble-flinging fun with nearly everything happening outside of it. With its use of generative AI to make in-game album covers (the generic quality of which doesn\u2019t live up to the awesome songs they hold), laughable \u201cmicro\u201d transactions, and small launch roster, its hard to convince myself to just sit back and enjoy the fights. Square Enix has promised regular updates to both Foamstars\u2019 competitive and cooperative modes, but the content drip seems to be just that; a drip feed. Each season is going to last a whopping five weeks, which seems far too long, especially without any new maps or modes planned until Season 4 \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be until mid-May, but there\u2019s a desperate need for them now. Charlie's Favorite 3rd Person Shooters With Creative Movement Movement is the most important part of a shooter for me. From Splatoon's creative take on platforming to Foamstars' cleverly weaponized movement, all of these games have really cool movement. See All 1 Splatoon 3 Nintendo EPD 2 Fortnite Epic Games 3 Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion Nintendo EPD 4 Splatoon Nintendo EAD 5 Splatoon 2 Nintendo 6 Foamstars Square Enix To make matters worse, Foamstars has placed all its bets on a horse with bad odds, following in the footsteps of Nintendo\u2019s famously confusing, unreliable online multiplayer. Almost all of Foamstars\u2019 game modes are only available at certain times, obnoxiously rotating on a fixed schedule or tied to specific days of the week. If it had launched with more maps and/or modes to cycle through, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but right now you can only play a handful of matches in a given mode before it pointlessly disappears into the Foamstars vault for an hour. This could easily be fixed by adding specific queuing options \u2013 but instead, Foamstars has chosen to surf in the choppy wake of an almost 10-year-old game without hitting the same highs. It will also never let you forget how impossibly sluggish everything, is as it annoyingly kicks you back to its hub area after each game, forcing you to cycle through its bafflingly slow matchmaking menus ad nauseam."

        "Content": "Nathan Hale is having a very bad day. Not only is his star-spangled country rapidly being overrun, but he just got alien blood on his Yankee blue jeans - and dang it - that stuff just won't come out in 1950s-pre-industrial-strength-stain-remover-America. He's also looking a little worse-for-wear himself; pallid skin, bloodshot eyes and a pugilist's nose \u2013 but that's nothing some rhinoplasty can't fix. The invasion, on the other hand? That'll take some elbow grease and a whole lot of ammunition.  Insomniac's second foray into the alternative history world of Resistance 2 proves to be one of the most perfectly rounded shooters available on a console \u2013 certainly the best on the PS3 and regularly a marvel of clever and punishingly hard design. It leaps into new areas shooters rarely aim for \u2013 eight player cooperative gameplay, 60 players online in a single match and a core campaign that boasts impressive scope and a location-hopping, grandiose storyline.  In terms of raw mechanics, Resistance 2 does not innovate, strictly speaking; it's not a game that pushes the mechanics of shooting, defending and advancing farther in any particular way. In fact, without a more refined cover system and a sometimes clunky sprint system, the combat sometimes feels very traditional and routine and therefore somewhat dated, which is a little disappointing. But Resistance 2 does offer is a fullness of options and modes, as well as a finely-tuned single-player experience that manages to impress through sheer polish as much as through its scale and visual variety.    It's also a very thoughtfully designed game on a technical level. While the difficulty ramps up quite a bit, the auto-save locations are mercifully frequent and the AI really does make you pause (making sure you're kneeling behind something, and ever so briefly) to reflect on how aggressive and unrelenting this game becomes. New enemies abound, presenting new airborne, aquatic and landlocked threats. Some, such as the Goliaths (fifteen feet of disturbing brutality and heavy weaponry) act as sub-bosses when they appear in threes and fours. You will die. A lot. Others, such as the swarms of fast moving, zombie-like hybrids that burst out of cocoons flood the screen with enemies and force you to keep on your toes. The game also ramps up the technological foes too \u2013 quadrupedal tanks with several types of weapons come two or three at a time, usually flanked with heavily armed squads of Chimeran foot soldiers. Plasma turrets, strategically positioned, can mow down a whole squad of humans with a single, sustained burst and must be dealt with indirectly, forcing you to think through the best flanking manoeuvre.  Thankfully, you won't be going into battle with pea-shooters and potato-guns; those projectile fetishists at Insomniac continue to push their weapons into strange, new places in Resistance 2. This time, in addition to a few returning weapons and grenades, upgraded versions of both the Auger and the Bullseye soon become your standard weapon of choice in the campaigns. The Marksman is a fantastic new addition to the collection too \u2013 a medium-distance assault rifle that fires three rounds in quick succession and featuring a secondary fire mode that fires out an electrified orb that zaps enemies around it. The Splicer fires out spinning blades of death or can be used, rather unnecessarily, as a melee weapon (though, your standard melee attack is practically as effective). A Magnum revolver with explosive-laden rounds is also excellent, but rare. The LAARK Rocket launcher now sports a secondary mode that fires out a swarm of micro projectiles \u2013 perfect for taking down a cloud of enemies or providing heavy suppression during a critical moment. Two other heavy weapons - a heavy-duty chain gun and a plasma cannon - round out the list, alongside sniper rifles, shotguns and all manner of things that go bickety-bam .   You will learn to hate those giant jerks. The Auger, on the other hand, is possibly the best weapon ever.  Visually, as well as in terms of level design and mission structure, Halo comparisons immediately spring to mind (the first Halo, we should point out \u2013 not the arguably unfocussed and compromised sequels). The AI-driven, squad-based combat and open, varied playing fields harkens back to those first critical steps towards an open battlefield; in Resistance 2, the scope and spread is enormous as you press back the Chimera in open canyons, through the streets of Chicago and its surrounding residential suburbs, through pine forest thickets or wading through waist-high flood water and over scenic ridges as storm clouds roll in, threatening torrential downpour. There's a naturalistic beauty to Resistance 2's original graphics engine \u2013 and critically, a use of a colour spectrum that consists of more than browns, beiges and muted earthy tones.  As the story shifts and things get more interesting (or convoluted, as might actually be the case), dirt and wood and cinderblocks eventually give way to steel, rubber, diffused glows and ornately designed alien technologies that are perfectly offset against the 1950s aesthetic. This is now formula for the series \u2013 and the overall design work continues to impress with its scale, if not the most cutting edge technologies at play. Enemy animations, however, are roundly fantastic; boss characters - enormous insectoid creations with numerous limbs, incredible joint articulation and musculature simulation - all look fantastically menacing. The microdetailing on some surfaces is remarkable too \u2013 small plant growth on the redwood forest floor, for instance.   The fractured narrative jumps around a little too much. Nathan Hale remains mostly unremarkable as a character \u2013despite some intrinsic changes to his persona as the story progresses, and a larger speaking role. This emotional distance between player and character falls on a lack of incidental storytelling in the game; the only time we really see Hale is during moments of critical storytelling. A few sequences of quiet reflection or some sort of inner monologue would've added some much needed personality and human insight to his character \u2013 which, in turn, would make players actually give a damn. Regardless, Resistance 2 still succeeds in holding the story's central threads together enough to provide motivation through the campaign. Again, it's not prizewinning storytelling, but it's a fun, disposable romp from end to end.  This is also a punishingly hard game at times, even on the standard difficulty. A lot of trial and error is required in some areas, and a dedication to using your weapons and limited munitions in a strategic way is something to be applauded. You're never inundated with ammo, and grenades remain a precious commodity. The end result is an adventure that actually plays out much more like Dragon's Lair \u2013 perfecting your path through an essentially linear experience while dying over and over and over again in the process. It can be maddening, but this challenge really creates a beautiful feeling of accomplishment that few shooters muster. Half-life 2 was one; Resistance 2 certainly stands proudly alongside in this regard; you're challenged \u2013 never pandered to.  Smoke effects and environmental detail has greatly improved since the first Resistance: Fall of Man.  Scripted events are genuinely memorable \u2013 the game shifts gears and speed more often than a rally driver.  Pressing through the flooded streets of Chicago, for instance, sees you leaping over Chimera-infested waters one minute, diving to cover from a volley of fire across the street another. Still further in, the location takes on a horror movie quality to the dilapidated, pitch black halls of ruined hotels. With your small but effective torch pushing back the darkness, you just know that whatever is thumping away on the floor above you is hungry, angry and waiting. That, dear reader, is called atmospheric perfection \u2013 the combination of pace, limited resources and dead-on presentation \u2013 and this is not easy to achieve.  A thoughtful experience system and unlockable secrets are married to the multiplayer and cooperative experience. These two areas make up the other half of the Resistance 2 package \u2013 and these cement Insomniac's effort as one of extraordinary long-term value. If you're not much of a social gamer \u2013 and that's probably a lot of you \u2013 you won't be punished for the occasional dabble in multiplayer. Traditionally, the experience and rank that you achieved in multiplayer stood on its own; a testament to your skill in the competitive arena and a literal badge of honour. However, if you joined the scene too late, it seemed like you were constantly struggling against players with better equipment and more applicable skills than yourself \u2013 even within the constraints of matchmaking. In Resistance 2, Insomniac addresses this imbalance by allowing you to play through the game and accrue experience points and earned 'Berserk' skills through both versions of the core campaign, so that when you're ready, you can tackle the online community.  On the subject of cooperative gameplay in Resistance 2, as you may have heard, operates in a separate parallel campaign entirely, trimmed of cutscene but heavy on action. For eight players playing over the net, this mode is an absolute riot, thanks to scaling difficulty and the need to really take advantage of your class distribution. There are three classes to choose from \u2013 and from experience, you really need to keep a balance of all three on hand to make it through the campaign alive. The soldier is your heavy-arms class, with access to improved armour, rounds and sights. The spec-ops character is about distance attacking, grenades and indirect fire with weapons like the Auger. Then there's the medic class \u2013 or, as we like to think of them, the 'cheap' class that you get your inexperienced buddy to play as. You see, of all three classes, the medic class keeps things nice and simple \u2013 you shoot the enemy with your 'medic gun' and you gain health. You basically can't die. You can also transfer health to your allies with its secondary attack. For more detailed information on the specifics of each class, head to one of our numerous previews . In brief though, as long as you have a medic on your side, co-op is fantastic \u2013 and the auto-balancing AI keeps things interesting and fresh.   Multiplayer remains brilliant fun - and with 60 players at once, it's also insanely chaotic by the end of the round.  In terms of competitive multiplayer, Skirmish mode is the big drawcard in Resistance 2. This is the much touted 60 player multiplayer mode that pits ten squads of six against each other as they work their way towards an objective point. Eventually, the squads diverge and all-out chaos takes over. It's brilliant fun, with no noticeable lag and just enough differentiation between insignias and squads to keep things from getting completely out of control. To be perfectly honest, more players doesn't always mean a better experience. That said, Insomniac's real achievement \u2013 and perhaps the biggest accomplishment in the entire game \u2013 is presenting a new way of handling massive battles such as this, with careful integration of leaderboards and MyResistance.net community-oriented features too.   The flaws in Resistance 2 are few and far between \u2013 however, there are some, and they're certainly worth mentioning. For one, no offline multiplayer beyond the dedicated co-op campaign is disappointing. We still think that sometimes a four-player split-screen experience between friends around a TV can be far more satisfying than online. The trend lately is to cater almost exclusively to online services \u2013 but not everyone has a net connection \u2013 and nobody likes being cussed out by a pimply teenager sitting in his grandmothers' basement in Milwaukee.  The narrative suffers from middle-story syndrome to some degree \u2013 the ending offers only some degree of closure but heavily hints at Resistance 3. Those collecting the secret intelligence briefcases will find that reading the contents will fill in a lot of gaps.  Linearity isn't a dirty word, but there comes a point where you realise that you must confront situations in just such a way, you will take damage no matter what, and trial-and-error is sometimes the only way to progress in these instances. These moments point towards strange balancing and design decisions that will occasionally raise an eyebrow or two in baffled frustration.   I think I remember this scene in Predator. It didn't end well for the human.  Finally, and perhaps most subtly, it becomes a little too easy to forget that this is a game rooted in 1950s alternate history. Whereas in the original Resistance, the English setting afforded a certain air to the setting thanks to some classic set pieces and objects, the United States is covered with alien wares and most weapons are pseudo-sci-fi now. Combat suits are a little too modern and overall the effect downplays the game's original trump card \u2013 the kitschy, dated time period. This isn't an overt problem \u2013 and you might disagree with our wanting of downgraded weapons or vehicles for the sake of authenticity. But conceptually, Resistance 2 suffers for not feeling quite as '50s' as it should. "

        "Content": "Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn\u2019t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It\u2019s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.  Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare\u2019s best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S. The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten \u2013 not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It\u2019s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.  Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you\u2019ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and \u2013 in the case of the space and water missions \u2013 special consideration for verticality and physics. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation\u2019s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.  But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It\u2019s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.  It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling \u2014 it's more about dumb fun \u2014 and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he\u2019s a member of the Ghosts. And then there\u2019s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.  The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.  Or, in the case of those for whom multiplayer is the primary focus, it handily gets out of the way other than to serve as the inspiration for map environments, equipment, and weapon design.  Ghosts preserves much of the look and feel of the traditional Call of Duty multiplayer experience, but introduces sweeping changes that make it more personalized, more diverse, and better balanced. At its core lies the expansive new Create a Soldier system, which affords us the ability to create and customize 10 unique characters, each with up to six loadouts, for a total of 60 available classes and 20,000 possible configurations. Create a Soldier also riffs on Black Ops II\u2019s Pick 10 system, allowing you to forego certain equipment in order to outfit a primary weapon with extra attachments or enable extra perks. In all, there are an impressive 39 weapons, 12 pieces of equipment, 35 new perks, 36 scorestreaks spanning three categories, and various weapons attachments to choose from.  Create a Solider is ambitious in its scope, and the sheer breadth of options caters to and empowers every style of play. Whether you want to run around like a high-powered knife-wielding mutant or move stealthily through a map by using heightened senses, you can. But for all of its versatility, Create a Soldier is dauntingly complex next to previous Call of Duty games. Even after hours of matches and experimentation, I felt as though I had only begun to understand the nuances of each of the 35 unique perks and how to optimize my classes for a specific style of play. On the one hand, Create a Soldier\u2019s depth will have enthusiast players honing their perfect loadouts for months, but on the other, it makes for a more challenging entry-level experience.  It's a credit to developer Infinity Ward that even while running around with a maxed-out weapon and the best complimentary perks I could find, at no point did I see a player gain a noticeable advantage. Unlike Black Ops II, which favors lightweight SMGs, Ghosts\u2019 balance encourages you to explore a variety of weapon types. SMGs are considerably less effective, while assault rifles are faster to shoulder and have a reduced impact on speed. A new class of weapons, called marksman rifles, bridges the gap between sniper rifles and assault rifles, providing range and power with greater mobility. Sniper rifles remain largely unaltered with two notable exceptions: new optics that preserve (but blur) your peripheral vision, and aim-assist has been reduced to make obnoxious quick-scoping harder to exploit.  The added emphasis on ranged weapons is paired with considerably larger maps, which greatly outnumber those that feature more traditional tight-quarters designs in the 15 included battlefields. In deathmatch-style gametypes, teams will often find themselves spread across smaller contingents at different sides of the map, whereas objective modes will draw everybody to certain points. Instead of just funneling players toward enemies via a limited number of paths, Ghosts presents an array of alternative routes, making team play far more effective than traditional run-and-gun strategy \u2013 in fact, running around these large maps gets lonely and boring. Traditional lone wolf-style play also throws a wrench in the spawn system, making enemies often appear nearby without warning. Playing in a well-coordinated group is more gratifying than ever, but more casual solo games can be frustrating.  There\u2019s also the much-touted map dynamicism, which disrupts pathways and sightlines using everything from player-triggered gates to a missile strike that turns the environment to a smoldering wasteland. The effect is less impactful and cinematic than Battlefield 4\u2019s crumbling buildings and dams, but with considerably smaller maps and faster-paced gameplay, grander scale or frequency would have been distracting. Instead, the traps and map events are only brief interruptions that can shake things up if one team becomes entrenched, but won\u2019t fundamentally alter the course of a game.  Ghosts multiplayer introduces five brand-new gametypes alongside all of the series staples like Domination and Kill Confirmed, for a total of 13 different modes. Although many of the new modes expand upon existing gametypes, each adds a fresh dynamic. My favorite new addition, Grind, is like Kill Confirmed, except that it requires you to not only collect dog tags from downed enemies, but also deposit them in one of two \u201cbanks\u201d on the map before being killed yourself. Another, Cranked, is like Team Deathmatch, but whenever you score a kill, you\u2019re given a 30 seconds to rack up another kill \u2013 or else you'll explode. Although they\u2019re simple modifiers, the new gametypes are immensely fun and breathe new life into multiplayer.  Extinction, Ghosts\u2019 new alien invasion mode, is better compared to Valve's Left 4 Dead games than Treyarch\u2019s zombie modes from Black Ops. It's a four-player cooperative mode wherein you fight off monstrous creatures through a miniature campaign set in a large, multi-stage level. Unlike zombies, the aliens are nimble and unpredictable, leaping over objects and scaling walls. It's a tough challenge, and teams must carefully consider their loadouts, special abilities, equipment, and power-up trees to ensure survival, making for an interesting strategic dynamic.  For a more traditional Call of Duty experience, but sheltered from the fierce competitive landscape of multiplayer, there\u2019s Squads: a suite of cooperative modes that offers wave defense (AKA horde mode) and competitive bot matches. In a cool touch, Squads uses your custom characters and classes as the basis for A.I. soldiers that play alongside you to battle other bots or human players. Bot matches are hardly novel for the genre, but the soldiers in Squads are especially notable because of how easy it is to mistake them for human players due to their use of advanced tactics. It's impressive how they move through maps aggressively, and appear to be acutely aware of other players.  Squads is an excellent testing ground, and offers a nice respite from online multiplayer while also contributing to online character progression using the unified Create a Soldier system. Most importantly, the new Call of Duty profile system allows players to carry over their stats, unlocks, and characters created for Squads or multiplayer across generations. If you play on Xbox 360 and visit a friend who owns a Xbox One, your character and all progression is carried over, and comes back home with you.  This is possible, in part, because of cross-generation, cross-platform feature parity. Character customization, maps, dynamic events, weapons, gametypes, and constant 60fps multiplayer framerates are ubiquitous across current- and next-gen platforms. The biggest variations between platforms falls upon visuals and player counts. On the current-gen versions Ghosts looks nearly identical, though I did encounter occasional framerate issues during the single-player campaign on PS3 and PS4, whereas my time with the Xbox One version was stable throughout.  Like Black Ops II, the Wii U version takes advantage of the gamepad to present a secondary display for the in-game map and provide touchscreen shortcuts to custom loadouts. The gamepad\u2019s display can also be used to play without a TV, though it also supports Wii Remotes and the controller. Graphically, the Wii U version is comparable to Xbox 360 and PS3, and overall, runs smoothly. Unsurprisingly, the PC version scales well from low- to high-end machines, and in most cases, looks superior to the next-gen experience.  It\u2019s difficult to appreciate the variation between current-gen and next-gen in TV commercials or a browser window, but up close and personal, the difference is drastic. Whereas the current-gen versions look muddy with blotchy textures, characters, weapon models, and environments are presented in vivid detail on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Call of Duty engine fares surprisingly well on next-gen, but even then Ghosts lacks a lot of the added atmospheric effects and visual panache that makes competing games look so realistic. I\u2019m eager to see what a future Call of Duty looks like when maintaining 60 frames-per-second on current-gen is no longer a concern.  When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there\u2019s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality.  It\u2019s certainly going to be a sticking point for those who demand the highest fidelity experience, but the difference is harder to identify in absence of a side-by-side comparison.  Oddly, the Xbox One version makes no use of the haptic feedback motors built into the controller\u2019s triggers, and the DualShock 4\u2019s trackpad is used solely as a button to toggle the in-game scoreboard during multiplayer.  There is, however, one notable exclusion from current-gen. Historically, Call of Duty has limited a majority of its modes to 12 players, but offered an additional playlist that supports 18-player matches known as Ground War. While the larger-scale matches live on with the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, owners of the Xbox 360, Wii U, and PS3 versions are capped at 12 players. It\u2019s a surprising step back for the series, and the larger maps could have benefited from the higher player count.  It should also be noted that my smooth multiplayer experience was hosted on a dedicated server hosted by Activision \u2013 and most of yours will be, too. Activision says that all platforms will use a hybrid of dedicated servers and peer-to-peer matchmaking, which should eliminate many of the lag issues we've seen in the past. If all goes well, the days of being tossed into a game hosted by someone 2,000 miles away on a dial-up connection will be behind us."

For me Halo has always been a social experience, with lifelong friendships forged over a shared love of the game. Some hop online to randomly test their merit in competitive matches. Others find themselves lost in the fiction, playing through the campaign alone and then poring over the extended story in books and anime. Still others look to Halo for a creative outlet as level forgers or machinima producers. This range in how we play Halo is a testament to how feature-rich development studio Bungie has made the franchise, and Halo: Reach is the ultimate punctuation on a decade's work.  This is the end of the Halo road for Bungie -- the group is set to move on to a new original game next while Microsoft takes over responsibility for the franchise's future -- and that sense of this being a finale is in Halo: Reach. It shows clear reference to past games, refines well-established game mechanics, adds a few exciting twists, and polishes the rest to a glossy finish. The result is one of the most complete, fully-featured packages you'll find in gaming.   Little here will surprise the hardcore Halo fan, especially if they were among the millions that took part in the multiplayer beta earlier this year. The approach to making a first-person shooter remains the same as it has in the past for Halo. There's a co-op friendly campaign filled with the dreaded Covenant aliens, sparkling online competitive multiplayer, the four-player Firefight mode, and lots of flexibility to allow everyone to tweak settings to their liking. If you've played a Halo game in the past, you'll feel instantly at home.  That's not to say this is just another rehash. There's plenty of new and exciting content in Halo: Reach and it begins with the main character. Master Chief is out. This time you'll step into the shoes of Noble 6, a nameless hero for players to project themselves onto. Noble 6 doesn't even have a defined gender. Thanks to a deep new customization system, you're free to fit Noble 6's look to your personality.  A dark tale of destruction awaits you.  Noble 6's tale begins with an introduction to Planet Reach. This colony is the center of humanity's military might, and home to the Spartan program that produced Master Chief himself. The events of Halo: Reach take place as a prequel to the main Halo trilogy and -- though they take small liberties with the established fiction -- help to tell the story of the events that lead up to events of Halos 1 through 3. The war with the Covenant is already raging, and things don't look good for us humans.  Noble 6 is the rookie member of Noble Team, a squad of Spartans stationed on Reach. You'll get to know each of the other team members through the course of Halo: Reach as you work with them to complete various missions, but the action always follows Noble 6's adventure.  The whole shebang will last you about nine or ten hours on your first play through on the Heroic difficulty (less if you're real good and more if you aren't). During that time you'll find a lot of tried and true mainstays of the Halo formula. That means plenty of big battlefields, crazy vehicles, lots of aliens to fight, and tons of weapons to help make the Covenant pay. Though past Halo games were filled with repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots, Halo: Reach does not suffer from these problems.   This is the most straightforward and enjoyable tale of destruction the franchise has yet to produce. And don't worry if you haven't played the other Halo games yet \u2013 though Reach will feel a lot deeper and more compelling to longtime Halo fans, it can stand on its own as a self-contained story. The tale starts out simple enough, but it quickly escalates to stunning set pieces before pulling out all the stops. The last third of the game is just one big thrill ride, and the revelations that occur during that part of the game are sure to make any Halo buff go ballistic. The ending in particular left a huge impression on me. I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that the space combat Bungie used to tease Halo: Reach is only the beginning.  Now, though the Halo formula is intact and there are plenty of wink-and-a-nod references to past games, Reach is a big step forward. Little successful elements of old Halo games are sprinkled here or there while a newfound sensibility in level design and pacing is wrapped around the core. The action is always moving through one combat scenario to the next, with plenty of gameplay and scenario twists to keep things fresh.  Halo Personality Quiz -- Find out which Spartan you are.  The best new addition? Armor abilities. These are an evolution of the equipment found in Halo 3 and drastically change the way you play in their updated form. These temporary but reusable extra abilities add things like sprinting, jet packs, and invincible armor to the franchise for the first time. The result is a faster, more acrobatic game that affords the player more flexibility in how they'd like to approach each fight. Also, jet packs are awesome. How did we go without them this long?  These new features and refined, classic design work in concert well enough that Halo: Reach often meets that gaming ideal of pure immersion -- the core components that can remind you that you're playing a game are a nonentity while you focus on the action at hand. While playing I found myself slipping into that state quite often, only occasionally ripped out by nasty difficulty spikes. Halo: Reach is a tough game on the harder settings -- easily the most difficult in the franchise -- and it only gets more challenging as you add co-op players thanks to a scaling difficulty.   That sense of immersion is helped along quite a bit by the amazing audio work and the new graphics engine built for Halo: Reach. Marty O'Donnell, the lead sound guy at Bungie, has once again delivered an epic soundtrack that is so good that it elevates the entire game. That's no small feat.  While that music pummels your ear drums, your eyes get to feast on one gorgeous looking game. The alien vistas and color palette are striking, and the sense of scale is oftentimes off the charts. You're fighting amidst a war that rages across an entire planet, and Bungie doesn't let you forget it. Even so, there are times when the epic battles don't quite feel so incredible thanks to a lack of detail or the occasional framerate stutter while the engine can't keep up with what's happening.  It's difficult to separate out the core components of Halo: Reach because they all sort of blend together into one massive experience. The campaign can be played alone or with up to four-players on a split-screen or online. Likewise, you can play the Firefight mode, a single map test of skill and endurance against waves of Covenant enemies, with a few friends cooperatively. All of those great additions that made it into the campaign? Well they're here too. This mode was introduced in Halo 3: ODST, but has finally met its promise thanks to online matchmaking and a more robust set of options. One of which is a competitive versus mode where you can compete for points while one or more players take up the side of the Covenant.

Like Firefight, the core concept remains the same as past Halo games while new features, weapons and modes have been added. Armor abilities and tweaked physics make the game that millions have poured hours and hours into feel fresh once again. It doesn't hurt that the new modes like Headhunter and Invasion are a ton of fun. The format is warmly familiar, but it all feels so new after digging into the competitive game and learning new tricks and skills.  Wrapped around all of this is an addition that Bungie calls player investment. Everything you do -- be it play the campaign or complete an online match -- earns you credits. Rack up enough and you can unlock customization features to make your Noble 6 look elite, and that look carries through all modes in the game -- even cut scenes. Don't be surprised if you find a goofy, pink-and-blue Noble 6 invading your game like IGN editor-in-chief Hilary Goldstein did. If you make your character look dumb, it's your own fault.  Firefight has met its promise.  Likewise, Xbox Live members can take part in daily or weekly challenges created by Bungie with an eye towards compelling players to come back again and again to prove their skills. This, for me, is the kicker. I don't think I'm going to be able to stop logging on every few days for a new challenge, followed by a little message to a friend taunting them about how I did it faster.  The one aspect of Halo: Reach I found lacking was in the multiplayer map selection. There are 13 total for competitive games, but four of those are either direct copies or retreads of maps from past Halo games. Everything plays quite differently with all of the gameplay tweaks, but I can already see myself looking forward to the first map pack. It's tough to complain about a lack of content in such a feature rich game, but I was left hoping for more.  IGN's History of Halo  That issue is mitigated to some extent by the incredible amount of flexibility built into Halo: Reach. The Forge, where players can lightly edit the competitive maps, is back and now much more user friendly. Most won't take advantage of that tool, but they will benefit from the new map and game variants that the hardcore create and share with the community.  It's also incredibly simple to just hop in and edit the rules of the game, both for Firefight and in normal multiplayer games. You can tweak everything from which enemies you face in Firefight to how much damage weapons do, and a whole lot more. Think of a crazy game variant -- even one that doesn't have anything to do with shooting -- and you can probably make it and share it with your friends in Halo: Reach. The whole system is incredibly powerful and equally impressive. The only downer is that there is no way to search for a custom game. If a game type isn't in the predetermined matchmaking hoppers and you don't have friends online, you're out of luck.  Yeah, you can play as the Elites online.  All told, the multiplayer suite is one of the best ever. The Halo multiplayer game has been expanding since the early days of the original Xbox, and now it's hit a point where the amount of , flexibility, number of modes, and potential for fun is just out of this world. Very few other games can compete with this level of polish, presentation, and attention to detail. And just when you think you've seen it all, don't forget to hop on to bungie.net to find extra stats, shared in-game screenshots and movies, and a vibrant community ready to help you extend the life of your game for months and months."

Legendary Edition The Legendary Edition contains everything the less expensive Limited Edition comes with, plus a lot more to justify the $150 price tag. It's all housed inside a special case made to look like an ONI security container. This is a pretty substantial set of bonus content, so let's get right to it. Like the Limited Edition, the Legendary box has a special black DVD case to house your copy of Halo: Reach. It's a nice touch, though not as sweet as the Halo 2 metal case I still proudly display on my shelf. The other crossover content with the Limited Edition includes an \"artifact bag\" that contains notes from Dr. Halsey, the creator of the Spartan program and blueprint  for Cortana. This bag is a must for any real Halo fan. Inside a hardbound notebook, you'll get tons of inside info made to look like it was handwritten by the good doctor, a patch, a mock UNSC security badge, a color map and a whole lot more. Play Halo: Reach and then go back and read through the manual for a deeper understanding of what happened in the game. Inside the disc case, you can find a code to download several exclusive pieces of content. There's a special flaming helmet armor affect for your Spartan (previously only available to Bungie employees), a cool Elite costume, and a Falcon Avatar accessory. This code also gives you two free days of Xbox Live Gold and a behind the scenes video delivered in a unique way. Rather than putting the video on a disc, it can be watched through Halo Waypoint after redeeming the code. Make sure you play the game before watching the behind the scenes video. It's two hours long and filled with spoilers, according to the descriptor. It wasn't available for us to watch in Halo: Waypoint pre-launch, so we can't comment on its quality. The crown jewel in the Legendary Edition is the hand crafted statue of Noble Team. This limited statue will surely make your friends jealous -- it's made for the true fan and collector. It's sturdy, well-crafted, and exactly the sort of thing that will make the Halo fanboys cry tears of joy.

The last third of the game is just one big thrill ride, and the revelations that occur during that part of the game are sure to make any Halo buff go ballistic. The ending in particular left a huge impression on me. I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that the space combat Bungie used to tease Halo: Reach is only the beginning. Now, though the Halo formula is intact and there are plenty of wink-and-a-nod references to past games, Reach is a big step forward. Little successful elements of old Halo games are sprinkled here or there while a newfound sensibility in level design and pacing is wrapped around the core. The action is always moving through one combat scenario to the next, with plenty of gameplay and scenario twists to keep things fresh. The best new addition? Armor abilities. These are an evolution of the equipment found in Halo 3 and drastically change the way you play in their updated form. These temporary but reusable extra abilities add things like sprinting, jet packs, and invincible armor to the franchise for the first time. The result is a faster, more acrobatic game that affords the player more flexibility in how they'd like to approach each fight. Also, jet packs are awesome. How did we go without them this long? These new features and refined, classic design work in concert well enough that Halo: Reach often meets that gaming ideal of pure immersion -- the core components that can remind you that you're playing a game are a nonentity while you focus on the action at hand. While playing I found myself slipping into that state quite often, only occasionally ripped out by nasty difficulty spikes. Halo: Reach is a tough game on the harder settings -- easily the most difficult in the franchise -- and it only gets more challenging as you add co-op players thanks to a scaling difficulty. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images That sense of immersion is helped along quite a bit by the amazing audio work and the new graphics engine built for Halo: Reach. Marty O'Donnell, the lead sound guy at Bungie, has once again delivered an epic soundtrack that is so good that it elevates the entire game. That's no small feat. While that music pummels your ear drums, your eyes get to feast on one gorgeous looking game. The alien vistas and color palette are striking, and the sense of scale is oftentimes off the charts. You're fighting amidst a war that rages across an entire planet, and Bungie doesn't let you forget it. Even so, there are times when the epic battles don't quite feel so incredible thanks to a lack of detail or the occasional framerate stutter while the engine can't keep up with what's happening. It's difficult to separate out the core components of Halo: Reach because they all sort of blend together into one massive experience. The campaign can be played alone or with up to four-players on a split-screen or online. Likewise, you can play the Firefight mode, a single map test of skill and endurance against waves of Covenant enemies, with a few friends cooperatively. All of those great additions that made it into the campaign? Well they're here too. This mode was introduced in Halo 3: ODST, but has finally met its promise thanks to online matchmaking and a more robust set of options. One of which is a competitive versus mode where you can compete for points while one or more players take up the side of the Covenant. Or you can just go all out in a fight against other players by joining the competitive online multiplayer game. Like Firefight, the core concept remains the same as past Halo games while new features, weapons and modes have been added. Armor abilities and tweaked physics make the game that millions have poured hours and hours into feel fresh once again. It doesn't hurt that the new modes like Headhunter and Invasion are a ton of fun. The format is warmly familiar, but it all feels so new after digging into the competitive game and learning new tricks and skills. Wrapped around all of this is an addition that Bungie calls player investment. Everything you do -- be it play the campaign or complete an online match -- earns you credits. Rack up enough and you can unlock customization features to make your Noble 6 look elite, and that look carries through all modes in the game -- even cut scenes. Don't be surprised if you find a goofy, pink-and-blue Noble 6 invading your game like IGN editor-in-chief Hilary Goldstein did. If you make your character look dumb, it's your own fault. Likewise, Xbox Live members can take part in daily or weekly challenges created by Bungie with an eye towards compelling players to come back again and again to prove their skills. This, for me, is the kicker. I don't think I'm going to be able to stop logging on every few days for a new challenge, followed by a little message to a friend taunting them about how I did it faster. The one aspect of Halo: Reach I found lacking was in the multiplayer map selection. There are 13 total for competitive games, but four of those are either direct copies or retreads of maps from past Halo games. Everything plays quite differently with all of the gameplay tweaks, but I can already see myself looking forward to the first map pack. It's tough to complain about a lack of content in such a feature rich game, but I was left hoping for more. That issue is mitigated to some extent by the incredible amount of flexibility built into Halo: Reach. The Forge, where players can lightly edit the competitive maps, is back and now much more user friendly. Most won't take advantage of that tool, but they will benefit from the new map and game variants that the hardcore create and share with the community. It's also incredibly simple to just hop in and edit the rules of the game, both for Firefight and in normal multiplayer games. You can tweak everything from which enemies you face in Firefight to how much damage weapons do, and a whole lot more. Think of a crazy game variant -- even one that doesn't have anything to do with shooting -- and you can probably make it and share it with your friends in Halo: Reach. The whole system is incredibly powerful and equally impressive. The only downer is that there is no way to search for a custom game. If a game type isn't in the predetermined matchmaking hoppers and you don't have friends online, you're out of luck. All told, the multiplayer suite is one of the best ever. The Halo multiplayer game has been expanding since the early days of the original Xbox, and now it's hit a point where the amount of , flexibility, number of modes, and potential for fun is just out of this world. Very few other games can compete with this level of polish, presentation, and attention to detail.

        "Content": "Halo means so much to so many people. This is not extraordinary in the culture of videogames. What's exceptional is how many different things it means to those players. For me Halo has always been a social experience, with lifelong friendships forged over a shared love of the game. Some hop online to randomly test their merit in competitive matches. Others find themselves lost in the fiction, playing through the campaign alone and then poring over the extended story in books and anime. Still others look to Halo for a creative outlet as level forgers or machinima producers. This range in how we play Halo is a testament to how feature-rich development studio Bungie has made the franchise, and Halo: Reach is the ultimate punctuation on a decade's work.  This is the end of the Halo road for Bungie -- the group is set to move on to a new original game next while Microsoft takes over responsibility for the franchise's future -- and that sense of this being a finale is in Halo: Reach. It shows clear reference to past games, refines well-established game mechanics, adds a few exciting twists, and polishes the rest to a glossy finish. The result is one of the most complete, fully-featured packages you'll find in gaming.      Limited Edition Most limited or special editions are filled with a few trinkets of questionable worth. This, however, is actually a pretty cool set of goodies, all for just an extra $10. Inside the larger box, you'll find a black DVD case that will make Halo: Reach stand out in your collection. That's a nice touch, but it's only the start. You'll also find an \"artifact bag\" that contains notes from Dr. Halsey, the creator of the Spartan program and blueprint  for Cortana. This bag is a must for any real Halo fan. Inside a hardbound notebook, you'll get tons of inside info made to look like it was handwritten by the good doctor, a patch, a mock UNSC security badge, a color map and a whole lot more. Play Halo: Reach and then go back and read through the manual for a deeper understanding of what happened in the game. Last, but not least, you can find a code to get a special armor set for your Elite multiplayer model. The Halo: Reach Limited Edition package is a great one, and one that I would recommend to anybody that wants more than the base game but can't quite afford the very expensive Legendary Edition. It may smell a bit funky when you first open it (seriously), but it's a great buy for serious Halo fans.  Little here will surprise the hardcore Halo fan, especially if they were among the millions that took part in the multiplayer beta earlier this year. The approach to making a first-person shooter remains the same as it has in the past for Halo. There's a co-op friendly campaign filled with the dreaded Covenant aliens, sparkling online competitive multiplayer, the four-player Firefight mode, and lots of flexibility to allow everyone to tweak settings to their liking. If you've played a Halo game in the past, you'll feel instantly at home.  That's not to say this is just another rehash. There's plenty of new and exciting content in Halo: Reach and it begins with the main character. Master Chief is out. This time you'll step into the shoes of Noble 6, a nameless hero for players to project themselves onto. Noble 6 doesn't even have a defined gender. Thanks to a deep new customization system, you're free to fit Noble 6's look to your personality.   A dark tale of destruction awaits you.  Noble 6's tale begins with an introduction to Planet Reach. This colony is the center of humanity's military might, and home to the Spartan program that produced Master Chief himself. The events of Halo: Reach take place as a prequel to the main Halo trilogy and -- though they take small liberties with the established fiction -- help to tell the story of the events that lead up to events of Halos 1 through 3. The war with the Covenant is already raging, and things don't look good for us humans.  Noble 6 is the rookie member of Noble Team, a squad of Spartans stationed on Reach. You'll get to know each of the other team members through the course of Halo: Reach as you work with them to complete various missions, but the action always follows Noble 6's adventure.  The whole shebang will last you about nine or ten hours on your first play through on the Heroic difficulty (less if you're real good and more if you aren't). During that time you'll find a lot of tried and true mainstays of the Halo formula. That means plenty of big battlefields, crazy vehicles, lots of aliens to fight, and tons of weapons to help make the Covenant pay. Though past Halo games were filled with repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots, Halo: Reach does not suffer from these problems.    This is the most straightforward and enjoyable tale of destruction the franchise has yet to produce. And don't worry if you haven't played the other Halo games yet \u2013 though Reach will feel a lot deeper and more compelling to longtime Halo fans, it can stand on its own as a self-contained story. The tale starts out simple enough, but it quickly escalates to stunning set pieces before pulling out all the stops.

        "Content": "It feels as if the paint had just begun to dry on Splatoon after its release on the Wii U in 2015 when Nintendo applied a fresh coat and relaunched it with Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That may be why this sequel feels less like a whole new game than a new version of the first one that rolls up the best post-launch updates to the colorful and adorably non-violent team-based shooter and adds some new toys. Of course, considering the first game is a lot of fun, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you missed it for lack of a Wii U. And despite some questionable choices that can leave you trapped in matchmaking purgatory, the addition of a standout and clever take on a co-op horde mode provides some seriously addicting fun that has me coming back for more.  Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2\u2018s emphasis on using vibrant, ink-based weapons to splatter both enemies and the ground alike in your team color to control territory makes it a distinctive kind of visually rewarding fun. Controlling the ground is more than just a way of keeping score, though \u2013 you\u2019re far more mobile in your own territory, creating lots of opportunity for strategies around creating a highway to an objective and cutting off your opponents, and also setting up areas to submerge into the ink and replenish your ammo. The key to victory on the eight distinct and symmetrical maps currently in rotation often lies in being aware of terrain, ink management, and the opposition\u2019s plans.   Between the original arsenal, the guns added in post-launch updates, and the new ones introduced in Splatoon 2, there\u2019s plenty of ink-based weaponry to choose from, and yet each type has distinct uses. There\u2019s the fast and furious Inkbrush that covers ground quickly, contrasted with the Slosher that manages to turn a literal bucket of ink into a deadly close-range weapon. One of my favorites of the new batch is the Dualies, dual-pistol style weapons that have a great rate of fire and also let you quickly dodge-roll when firing to strafe enemies and release a concentrated burst of ink. There\u2019s also a brand-new array of special weapon powerups, many of which work well with proper coordination to break stalemates. The protective Ink Armor shields your entire team from harm, while the Tenta Missiles can lock onto and fire a salvo of ink strikes on multiple enemies.  Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game. \u201c  Going hand in hand with Splatoon 2\u2019s wealth of weapons is a set of gear that provides both style and bonuses in combat, with the added twist of over 20 random secondary abilities that unlock after you\u2019ve battled with them equipped enough times. These range from practical effects, like increasing ink recovery rates, to highly specialized abilities that can track the enemy who last splatted you or players you\u2019ve recently hit. Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game, too \u2013 you can now order any gear you\u2019ve seen on other people in-game using currency earned from battle, though the abilities attached to yours might not be the same due to random generation. Paying to scrub unwanted extra traits to make room for new ones leaves chunks of those abilities behind to apply to other gear, letting you mix and match from your inventory, or you can try your luck at unlocking different bonuses to replace the old ones that better align with your playstyle. This is a good way get value out of gear you earned but don\u2019t plan to wear: by scrubbing enough ammo-conserving bonuses from gear I wasn\u2019t using, I was then able to apply that trait to my favorite jersey (for a hefty price). Offering the chance to craft the perfect gear for your playstyle to give you a better edge in the more competitive Ranked Battles has kept me more invested than I was in the first Splatoon.  Aquatic Ambience  With a world this colorful and fun, it\u2019s great to see how much better people and places look on the Switch. Characters like the weapons dealer Sheldon and clothing merchant Jelfonzo look better than ever with more detailed models and textures, and the various forms of street art and graffiti scattered around the maps pop. The ink itself shimmers and glints with shiny flecks. Despite it all, Splatoon 2 never failed to maintain a smooth 60 frames per second in battle even with ink flying in all directions in a fully populated eight-player match. In handheld mode, things look great, and the option to set sensitivity for both modes of play helped immensely when switching between handheld and docked mode. I actually ended up swapping between motion and non-motion controls with surprising ease (though not being able to use the control stick to look up and down with motion and controls does take getting used to every time).   Solo Artist  Splatoon 2 brings back a very familiar and simple 32-mission single-player campaign that, with some exceptions, follows the style of its predecessor almost to the letter. There\u2019s a fair amount of hand-holding and will only take six or so hours to run through and find most collectibles, but missions provide some pretty fun ideas to play around with. There are places to stylishly grind on ink-rails like a squid version of Tony Hawk, and elsewhere you can lure giant, ink-vacuuming Squee-G robots into your enemies\u2019 path. Spraying ink to activate expanding sponges or moving platforms gives it a light Super Mario Sunshine feel, but it rarely challenges you the way co-op and multiplayer do. The most significant improvement over Splatoon is that the sequel\u2019s campaign lets you try out each of the weapon types, which is a great way to learn about their potential and how they can be used in multiplayer before jumping online. This focus on weapon research greatly extends replay value, as you can head back into levels you\u2019ve already conquered to discover new challenges based on the weapons\u2019 strengths and limitations.  Heading into Splatoon 2\u2019s main lobby lets you queue up for an engaging variety of online modes. Each mode automatically drops you in one of two maps that change up every two hours, which keeps things feeling fresh and doesn\u2019t let a map wear out its welcome as quickly as in other games, where the community often picks a favorite and plays it to death. The standard Turf War mode, which carries over from the original, is welcoming for beginners and veterans alike with the simple yet entertaining concept of competing to ink the most territory in three minutes. No two matches ever feel the same because the battlefield hotspots \u2013 dictated by the competing colors of ink \u2013 are constantly changing, and several times being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory. This is one case where I actually miss the Wii U gamepad \u2013 without the second-screen map or an always-on-screen minimap, you have to hold a button to overlay a map to see how things are going or jump to a teammate\u2019s location. This means you\u2019ll need to be that much more alert to the status of your team and the terrain, and finding a safe spot to check the map overlay took some getting used to.  Being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory. \u201c  Besides Turf Wars, Ranked and League Battles are where more precise and objective-based modes await. There\u2019s a king-of-the-hill-inspired Splat Zone, a tug-of-war style payload mode called Tower Control, and a spin on capture the flag where you carry a powerful but movement-impeding weapon to the enemy base called Rainmaker. Splat Zone is the most basic of the trio, and I prefer the modes where teams fight over a moving target like the mobile tower in Tower Control, and the Rainmaker weapon that was constantly changing hands. Even when both teams are working well together and locked in a tug-of-war for control, matches move at a quick pace, which prevents drawn-out stalemates. Even though Ranked Battles rotate between modes every few hours, I\u2019m glad each mode has their own ranking system so I can see which modes I\u2019m best at and where I need to improve.   The only real problems I\u2019ve encountered so far are the lobby\u2019s matchmaking system and the lack of a between-match loadout screen. Like in most games, once you\u2019ve picked your mode of choice you\u2019ll be sent to a room awaiting seven more players to begin. The catch is that nobody can cancel out or do anything else (such as the minigame the first Splatoon gave us to kill the time here) until either the match fills up or the timer runs out a couple of minutes later. Even if your group does fill up fast (which we can assume will be more likely after launch) and you get to play a round, you're still left with the problem of being unable to swap out weapons and gear between matches. I don\u2019t mind not being able to switch during a match because that makes you carefully consider your choices and commit to the role your weapon fills, and the matches aren\u2019t that long to begin with. But after playing with a great group and leveling up, the last thing I want to do is ditch them just so I can put on a new pair of shoes.  Cooperative Calamari  Where Splatoon 2\u2019s single-player campaign gently guides you through Octoling enemies, the new Salmon Run mode is an excellent cooperative foil. As hilarious as it is addicting, this mode puts you and up to three other players up against three timed waves of relentless enemies while collecting a quota of golden eggs from boss creatures and depositing them in a basket. Unlike other horde modes, Salmon Run deftly uses Splatoon\u2019s ink and territory mechanics to ensure you\u2019re not only splatting fish but also struggling to maintain control of the ground as enemies try to stifle your movement. The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I\u2019ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead, wielding trash as makeshift weapons and armor and shooting beams of ink from atop a tower of pots and pans. Their distinct looks help you assess threats quickly, which is essential because your team must neutralize them before being overwhelmed.   When playing online, you\u2019ll be given one of four random weapons to use for every wave, and I love how it challenged me to adapt and fill new roles on my team: In one wave I was sniping bosses with the Splat Charger, but in the next wave I had to clear a path to the egg basket with the Roller instead. Difficulty can be set when playing locally, and steadily grows when online thanks to the randomized nature of enemy waves and weapon loadouts, boss configurations, and special events like rising water levels or egg-stealing mothership invasions. Those shifting conditions kept me coming back to see what would happen next.  The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I\u2019ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead. \u201c  Playing locally with friends is a blast \u2013 my teammates and I frantically screamed out boss names and locations of golden eggs to direct each other to counter problems and capitalize on opportunities. But this also highlights how key communication is to survival, something that doesn\u2019t currently translate well in random online matchups, where you can only give basic callouts. Fortunately, with Nintendo\u2019s new companion app you can create voice chat groups with friends on your phone - but there are some significant problems. While you can check out nifty details about matches and order more gear from your app, the voice chat system feels woefully lacking. You can only chat with friends in certain modes, and while chatting your phone cannot be used for anything else (even turning off the screen will mute all conversation). Given that the app won\u2019t let you talk to friends outside of specific lobbies, and that I\u2019m not a fan of having my phone battery drained by a screen that can\u2019t be turned off, I\u2019m much more inclined to use Skype or Discord to talk with friends.  And speaking of bizarre catches: for some reason, the excellent co-op mode can only be played online on certain days for specific amounts of time \u2013 for instance, 5:00AM to 5:00PM \u2013 which is truly frustrating considering just how fun it is. After a fun weekend playing with friends, finding out I can\u2019t play again for two days can get annoying, especially when I can\u2019t discern any rhyme or reason to the Salmon Run schedule. Not being able to easily remember the next available slot time forces me to constantly check in-game for the next five openings. I get that Nintendo wants to ensure full rooms on the days Salmon Run is active, but this seems like a poor way to do it. I\u2019d rather have the option to queue up with friends online or have a way to easily back out if nobody is around to play with (going it alone is pretty much a death sentence). On the days the mode is active, you can earn quick rewards not found anywhere else which is a nice bonus; if you choose to play locally you can play as much as you want, but it takes much longer to earn bonuses."

With four players on each team, #IDARB is borderline impossible to keep up with -- which makes playmakers feel all the better when a plan comes together. Setting up those big moments earns teams more points, too, and that\u2019s the hook. Accuracy and precision takes skill, since you both move and aim with the left stick, and firing off a high-speed shot (or missing a pass) could cause the ball to bounce off the edges of the opponents\u2019 net and back into your defensive zone. Everything about #IDARB relies on your reflexive, instant reactions to always-unpredictable events. Scoring is hard, but because #IDARB is so responsive and skill-centric, it makes getting a goal all the more rewarding -- and it gets even better as the player count increases. Passing the ball to an airborne ally creates a combo multiplier that pays off with more points when they score, particularly if they\u2019re farther away from the goal -- the farther you are, the more points you earn. The satisfaction of having a risky play send your score soaring over an opponent\u2019s keeps both teams striving to make big moves. When a massive play failed, our room full of local players burst into hysterical screaming -- one side relieved, the other horrified, both ecstatic for their next opportunity. A team of two is enough to get in position, pass the ball between players, and score goals by throwing the ball into a blocky net. Skilled players reveal themselves when intercepting passes and setting up alley-oop shots. Causing turnovers by blasting the offender with a burst of energy is essential as well; it disjoints possession, sending the ball loose into the multi-tiered playing field. Erratic shifts in who\u2019s carrying the ball causes frantic communication in teams who play to win, which is simultaneously part of what makes #IDARB entertaining, and why it\u2019s smart. Clearly explaining where you are, when you\u2019re available for a pass, and what you\u2019re planning, is challenging but crucial. Helpful visual language, like the line popping out of players calling for passes, give ball-carriers information amid the babbling chaos of their couch competitors. And #IDARB is at its most enjoyable with a large competitive couch crew -- online multiplayer works, but I ran into persistent and significant problems. Most notably, it suffers from inconsistent latency issues that made each match a crap-shoot in performance; one would run smoothly, while the next had an unbearable frame rate that destroys the split-second timing that makes #IDARB a great game. Also, when playing alone at home, you can\u2019t queue into a multiplayer game with custom settings -- playing alone means playing 1v1. Playing with one local pal means queuing into a 2v2, etc. #IDARB\u2019s online multiplayer is neutered by an absence of matchmaking options, and I constantly wished I could jump into a four- or eight-player match when I didn\u2019t have guests. This extends to local play somewhat as well. If you have, say, three or five players, the teams end up uneven, and there\u2019s no way to fill the spot with an online player or A.I. bot -- and unbalanced teams led to one unhappy team every time. Customization options are excellent, though. If you\u2019re all-in on #IDARB, you can create your own character sprites using a simple sprite editor. It\u2019s too small to allow for much sophistication, but it was enough to use that I could recreate my favorite Dota 2 Heroes, and recognize dozens of the pre-made Halo, The Walking Dead, Super TIME Force, and suspiciously Disney Princess-esque characters. Using your sprites, or the included ones, you can create teams for tournaments, as well as give them their own intro music using #IDARB\u2019s easy-to-use and surprisingly great music tool. I spent a couple hours composing little themes, messing with drum rhythms, bass lines, and goofy sound effects, and found the editor fun to use because it\u2019s simple without sacrificing depth. It only allows for four instrument layers, but it was sufficient enough for my musician coworkers to create awesome compositions."

        "Content": "The pendulum of the Red Dead Online experience, which quietly removed its beta label in May, is one that swings wildly. One moment I might be engaged in patient management barely distinguishable from Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s slow-paced single-player gameplay, perhaps perched on one knee by a fire barbequing a batch of pork rubbed with freshly plucked oregano (or mint, or thyme). The next, though, could just as well be the complete chaos of PvP multiplayer in indiscriminate, close-quarters slaughter in which I might be sprawled dead for the umpteenth time in the labyrinthine alleys around Saint Denis\u2019 Lanik Electrical factory with a tomahawk in my face courtesy of someone called 420bong_rip. As an online environment full of real people, some of whom will invariably be pond scum, Red Dead Online may not be as elegant an experience as the carefully curated single-player world, but the true appeal tends to expose itself when facing its unforgiving landscape beside friends.  This is a broad beast stuffed with story-driven co-op missions, a seemingly endless array of odd jobs and side quests, plus a growing set of PvP deathmatches and horse races, all housed within Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s enormous, living wild western world. During my time in Red Dead Online so far I\u2019ve partnered with pals to gun down waves of egg-sucking NPCs on behalf of an angry widow with an itchy trigger finger, and I\u2019ve sat with other random players for hours playing round after round of Texas hold \u2019em. I\u2019ve quaffed beers amongst a friendly fight club in a Blackwater bar where nary a single smokewagon was skinned, and I\u2019ve been shot in the back while unarmed by lily-livered cowpokes too cowardly to seek out a fair fight elsewhere. I\u2019ve ridden on my lonesome and as part of a posse, survived a handful of in-game ambushes, hunted anything with a heartbeat, and fished and fished and fished.   Come, Helen Highwater  Red Dead Online unfolds across the same exquisite world as Red Dead Redemption 2, which is all unlocked from the outset (even the parts that are temporarily inaccessible for story reasons in single-player). Set just prior to the main story of Arthur and the Van der Linde Gang, Red Dead Online has its own tale to tell and casts us as patsies caught up in a grand, revenge-driven plot that has yet to fully unfold in the dozen-plus story missions that Rockstar has made available thus far. An introductory sequence lets us create a character \u2013 man or woman \u2013 from scratch. It\u2019s not entirely unlike GTA Online\u2019s character creator, though only a single character can be created and maintained at this stage. There are plenty of options here to create a character with a face that would stop a clock, thanks largely to the dental selections (which range from corn-kernel yellow to missing entirely). On PS4 I\u2019ve opted for a broad-shouldered, redheaded woman with a scarred face and a bad attitude, presumably from a lifetime of growing up with a pun for a name. (Sorry about that, Helen Highwater.) On Xbox One, \u201cRavishing\u201d Rick O\u2019Shea is my boy. He\u2019s Irish, probably. No one\u2019s ever heard his accent. She's all bad.  The intro that follows is a gently paced series of cutscenes and tasks which set the tone for a lot of what follows. Helen or Rick or whoever you\u2019ve cobbled together has been sentenced to hang for a murder they didn\u2019t commit \u2013 the killing of the widow Jessica LeClerk\u2019s husband \u2013 but is broken out and put to work by LeClerk and her associate to aid in the pursuit and punishment of the folks actually responsible. The intro doesn\u2019t last too long, though, and before you know it you\u2019ll be loose in the open world, free to tackle Red Dead Online in any way you see fit. Want to plough through the story missions? Get cracking. Want to earn cash and XP by moseying around the countryside taking on jobs from the \u2018Strangers\u2019 dotted around the map as quest-giver NPCs? Go right ahead. Want to spend all your time at the poker table? Deal yourself in. Prefer skulking about in the woods shooting bears and badgers? There\u2019s nothing stopping you (well, nothing except the bears themselves and, to a lesser extent, the badgers). Not quite everything has made the jump from the single-player sandbox, but there\u2019s certainly more than enough to keep me occupied every time I log in.  Red Dead Online plays just like its solo-oriented stablemate, from the same style of deliberate, weighted movement to the same type of frantic gunfights rife with tumbling bodies, sailing hats, and squelching headshots. Health, stamina, and Dead Eye cores need to be maintained by eating the right food when necessary, horses need to be cared for, and guns need to be kept clean. Those of you who grew tired of this sort of stuff in the single-player are unlikely to be swayed here but I still really like the survival aspect and the atmosphere of authenticity it helps create. Oh dear.  Red Dead Online\u2019s story missions unfold much like those within Red Dead Redemption 2; they\u2019re generally a series of rides, chases, and/or gunfights stitched together and bookended with well-produced cutscenes. They can\u2019t be played alone \u2013 they must be played in two- to four-player co-op \u2013 but you can either bring friends or let the matchmaking group you up with random players. Even though I\u2019d generally rather play alone than with strangers, matchmaking is quick and painless and I\u2019ve never needed to wait long to be linked up with enough players to start a story mission. Also, some of the missions require players to split up to achieve objectives and wouldn\u2019t support a solo player, so the requirement is at least justified by the mission design and not entirely arbitrary.  There are several memorable missions, including surviving an epic siege in the town of Valentine, storming Fort Mercer in iron armour inspired by the Kelly Gang, and robbing a Saint Denis bank and escaping through the streets in an 1898 version of GTA IV\u2019s famous Heat-inspired Three Leaf Clover heist. One mission I played \u2013 Kerosene, Tar, and Greed \u2013 was a bit of a bust as a first-time player because my more experienced match-made partners disappeared from the outset, riding ahead of the instructions and accomplishing most of the required tasks before I even knew where to go to complete them. Other than that, however, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with the story missions. Safe from whom? Not me, I guess.  Interestingly, four missions are exclusive to players with high honour, and four are only playable by those with low honour. It\u2019s certainly a good way to prevent people who fancy themselves as more noble types from needing to get embroiled in cop-killing sprees, but it does mean that everybody will miss some neat missions on one side or the other unless they opt to tank their honour with an hour or so of senseless slaughter (or pay precious gold bars to have their honour flipped).  On top of the main story thread, however, there are 20 \u201cStranger\u201d characters dotted around the map, ready to assign side missions from an apparently bottomless supply of escorts, deliveries, assassinations, kidnappings, repossessions, robberies, and more. As Stranger missions can range from hunting down outlaws and hijacking stagecoaches to collecting wagons and, er, delivering wagons, some are certainly less exciting than others. However, hovering over a previously met character on the map screen will remind you what missions they offer, if there are any in particular you want to avoid. Unlike Story missions, Stranger missions can be played alone \u2013 although it\u2019s worth considering bringing a friend along to discourage rival players from messing with you as you try to complete them.   That\u2019s actually been a relatively rare occurrence for me recently, and I\u2019ve found general griefing down noticeably since the May 14 update. I\u2019ve been able to complete almost all the Stranger missions I\u2019ve attempted over the previous two weeks unmolested. I can\u2019t figure out exactly why toxic play seems less rife but the new defensive mode seems to be a help by making attacking random players generally more trouble than it\u2019s worth (toggling into defensive mode makes it impossible for other players to lock-on to you in auto-aim, and also makes you able to withstand slightly more punishment). There\u2019s also a new ability to press charges, which raises your killer\u2019s bounty and hostility level. On the surface it seems like some sort of mechanic designed to dissuade bad sports from summarily killing others unprovoked, although randomly killing others already used to automatically boost the perpetrator\u2019s bounty. I\u2019m not sure the \u201cPress Charges\u201d bounty amount is adequate. I\u2019ve experimented on a couple of occasions after being murdered by opting not to use the parley option (which renders me immune to a griefer\u2019s actions for 10 minutes) and have found that some aggressive players are content to continue to kill me, even while I\u2019m in defensive mode, and even after I\u2019ve pressed charges half a dozen times. Clearly the penalty isn\u2019t significant enough, and perhaps it needs to multiply for multiple kills on the same player within a small window. At the very least there certainly should be no XP awarded for killing players in defensive mode, as there currently is. Unprovoked nonsense is still occurring but it has reduced.  The Good, the Bad and the Bloody  I had a terrible 48 hours of connection issues in the two days before update 1.10, regularly losing pelts and progress thanks to a spate of crashes, but in a very pleasing turnaround I\u2019ve had almost no issues in the past week. There are still some annoying hitches (I\u2019ve still lost pelts from the back of my horse after using a fast-travel post, on more than one occasion I\u2019ve triggered a Stranger mission only the have the objective disappear without notification after going to the map screen, and I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve attracted a Wanted level in Saint Denis for \u2018stealing\u2019 my own horse) but it\u2019s generally pretty sturdy.  One major mechanical difference between single-player and multiplayer, of course, is the way Dead Eye is handled. You\u2019re naturally unable to go into slow-motion while online but Dead Eye is still an absolutely crucial technique to master in order to be remotely competitive when you hop into the bloody PvP modes.  Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever 184 Images  Icons to enter a playlist of multiplayer deathmatch-style games are dotted around the map but opting in via the pause menu is far easier. Small (up to 16 players) and large games (up to 32 players) are separated into two different playlists that cycle randomly through game types, though the latest multiplayer match types added via updates appear to be accessible directly from the pause screen while they\u2019re fresh. The newly added Overrun is the pick for me, though my preference is the layout that\u2019s a narrow strip of checkpoints that two teams must try to push each other back through, like if World War I was restricted to the width of a two-lane freeway and had a time limit of two minutes. Most Wanted is okay, too; it\u2019s essentially a deathmatch where the more players you kill, the higher your own value becomes, and other people will subsequently get more points for killing you. In theory it\u2019s possible to come from behind by killing the Most Wanted and netting a windfall of points; in practice, success mostly just put me in the sights of a better player (or at least one with better guns, better ammo, and/or ability perks that allow them to eat way more damage).   I\u2019ve had more success in the small-scale battle royale modes, like Make It Count (which restricts all players to the same, single weapon and the last one alive is the overall winner), or the new Last Stand (which lets us bring our own loadout but the maps are much smaller and it\u2019s the first to win two rounds who emerges as overall victor). While the other modes are essentially fast-paced and frantic massacres with slightly different rulesets and objectives for each, Red Dead Online\u2019s battles royale suit my pace of play more by allowing me to sneak, hide, and set up ambushes.  I\u2019ve also tasted success in another recently added mode (Head for the Hills, where teams of players must either reach a safehouse by fighting or sneaking their way through enemy-patrolled territory, or stop a rival team from reaching said safehouse) but I reckon this mode is too harsh on defenders. It seems surprisingly easy to sneak through the fairly large maps without being seen by your opposition, and once hidden behind the safehouse you\u2019re untouchable because defenders aren\u2019t able to leave their area to get their sights on you. The period appropriate victory screens are a cool touch.  The horse races in Red Dead Online are interesting as they\u2019re simultaneously one of the silliest modes (think Road Rash 1899, and add smashing through barrels to boost your horse\u2019s stamina and pick up weapons) and yet also the most skilled-based. The extremely potent auto-aim is disabled during horse racing so, while you can collect and use firearms, hitting anyone is actually quite difficult (as it really ought to be, clinging to the back of a 500-kilogram animal doing 40 miles per hour firing guns that were probably invented before the lightbulb). I barely bother with the weapon pick-ups, actually; trying to focus on hitting someone ahead usually just slows me down.  There are three different types of horse races: circuit races, point-to-point races, and \u2018Open Races\u2019, the latter of which are basically frantic treasure hunts as all players dart around an open map collecting the scattered checkpoints in any order before racing to a single finish line. I have a preference for the regular circuit and point-to-point races at this point, as everyone\u2019s more or less on a level playing field (as opposed to having to collect a bunch of widely dispersed checkpoints and hoping you chose the most efficient route to each of them).   Microtransaction Reaction Red Dead Online features microtransactions based on gold, a second currency that can be slowly accumulated by playing or rapidly purchased for real cash. It\u2019s slightly insidious that some cosmetic items are restricted to gold-only purchases, but it depends on how much you value your wardrobe. Me? I\u2019ve changed clothes about once in the past six months and couldn\u2019t care less about emotes. As far as its effect on actual gameplay, gold can\u2019t be used to level up, but it can be used to bypass level locks on cosmetic stuff. Gold can also be used to buy weapons, but you can\u2019t buy them early; you still need to have reached the eligible rank. Gold can\u2019t be used to upgrade ability perk cards, either (they require a combination of XP and cash). At any rate, Rockstar has been giving out so much gold for free lately it\u2019s just been sitting idle in my inventory (you can get 10 free gold bars just by adding two-factor security to your Rockstar Social Club account at the moment). By fluttering between hunting, Stranger missions, and story missions I have more in-game money than things I\u2019m desperately keen to buy right now. For better or for worse, levelling up is quite slow, so by the time I unlock the occasional new item I want I\u2019ve found I\u2019d already accrued enough money for it. Gold seems like a timesaver for those with eyes bigger than their wallets.  There are also Free Roam events, which gather anyone currently in Free Roam who accepts the invite and dumps them into various contests. I\u2019m not a fan of Fool\u2019s Gold, which sees a mob fighting over the chance to wear golden armour, and Railroad Baron is frustrating too (think King of the Hill on a train, but you have to catch the train on your horse each time you die, and you respawn in clumps alongside other rivals). It\u2019s chaos and should probably be for two smaller teams rather than a free-for-all. I don\u2019t mind Master Archer (build up points by hitting bullseyes hung around the map with a bow and arrow) but other people do ruin it by running around blasting folks with rifles. Perhaps combat should be disabled. I do love the fishing competitions, though, if only because I\u2019m finally decent at it. Trout of this world.  All in all, however, Red Dead Online\u2019s PvP modes are easily my least favourite part of the whole package. They\u2019re certainly not the reason I play it and I\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019d miss them if they suddenly vanished. For me, it\u2019s all about co-op and PvE gameplay, which Red Dead Online\u2019s free-roam mode and story/stranger missions are brimming with. The big hurdle for me when it comes to taking on other humans is that it just feels like I\u2019m wasting my time and energy going up against higher-level players who have access to better ammo and upgraded perks within the ability card system (which seems packed with power-ups geared towards compromising the balance of any given shootout). I just don\u2019t find it fun fighting high-level players packing more potent special ammo and bulletproof hats, who are also splurging on tonics to fortify their health, stamina, and Dead Eye bars. I just don\u2019t have the energy to match that commitment to maxing out perks, constantly accumulating better bullets, and overdosing on special tonics just to be in the same league. It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019d rather beat them at the poker table, or just disappear and go fishing. But that\u2019s the beauty of Red Dead Online: I can opt out of entire portions of it and still have stacks to do because it\u2019s so damn big."

        "Content": "Insurgency: Sandstorm is an excellent multiplayer shooter that successfully avoids the common pitfalls of military simulation, but still manages to deliver an immersive, at times disturbing, sense of realism to its modern, Middle Eastern setting. Its arsenal consists of some of the best-realized firearms in any video game to date thanks to stellar sound design, punchy animations, and obsessive attention to detail. Elsewhere, though, things aren't quite as glamorous: I found most of its maps to fall into the \u201cjust okay\u201d category due in part to poorly defined restricted areas that, on top of being annoying to encounter, are easily exploited. Still, Insurgency: Sandstorm punches well above its weight, offering phenomenal gunplay that shows up much of its big-budget competition.  If ever there was an example of outstanding FPS gunplay, Insurgency: Sandstorm is surely it. That surprisingly elusive feeling isn\u2019t a result of any one factor but rather a marriage of several. To boil it down: pronounced but manageable recoil, a near-instantaneous time to kill, percussive sound, impactful graphics, and an obsessive understanding of firearms come together to make SMGs, LMGs, shotguns, and especially assault rifles feel truly special.   And while Sandstorm has ample amounts of all of the aforementioned qualities, it leans hard into its knowledge of how guns actually work. Upon chambering a round at the start of a match, you can then swap magazines to effectively increase your capacity by one. Tiny details like the depression of the magazine release or the change in position of the fire selection switch are all visible on the gun models and are thoroughly appreciated. You can double tap the reload button to perform a hasty magazine swap that, while faster, discards any remaining ammunition in the spent magazine. Shotguns have remarkable range by FPS standards. And finally, there is slight deadzone in the middle of your aiming axis where only the gun moves and your character does not. That sounds weird but feels great. These details may seem trivial but the results are anything but.  The effect that all this realistic weaponry has on the battlefield is downright scary. \u201c The effect that all this realistic weaponry has on the battlefield is downright scary. If you\u2019re looking to walk away from your modern military FPS with mild tinnitus then Sandstorm on a pair quality headphones is a good place to start. Bullets produce a loud snap when whizzing by, and a burst of automatic gunfire against a nearby metal surface is almost deafening. I\u2019ve never been in combat, but this seems to be a much more realistic representation than we typically see in games. The most disturbing sounds, though, come in the form of determined, blood-spewing coughs and the labored, wailing death rattles produced by both your enemies and allies. These touches are intense, and I wouldn\u2019t blame if you find them to be in poor taste. But I, for one, prefer a depiction of war that doesn\u2019t obscure its horrific nature. The feeling of being in the thick of it is enhanced by myriad post-processing and particle effects that successfully punch up Sandstorm\u2019s otherwise-modest looks.  This brutal, at times tragic depiction of war certainly makes an impact at first. And while such scenes eventually become secondary to the fixation on gameplay, a few particularly unsettling scenarios managed to evoke an audible \u201coof\u201d from me, even well after the 30-hour mark. And while its commitment to realism is apparent throughout, Insurgency: Sandstorm also knows when gameplay should come first. For instance, even in the absence of enemy hit indicators I was rarely left pondering an enemy\u2019s fate thanks to the impressively large and (hopefully) exaggerated mist of blood that landing a shot produces. Other compromises are even less subtle, like HUD elements that display the position of allies through walls. Kicking in a door has the effect in instantly killing anyone on the other side, and you can even jump on a grenade to reduce or prevent the damage dealt to nearby allies. While some of these examples may have a real-world analog, they feel to me like solid choices that were made for the sake of better gameplay, and I appreciate them.  While its commitment to realism is apparent throughout, Insurgency: Sandstorm also knows when gameplay should come first. \u201c The non-competitive versus playlist contains two modes that support up to 32 players: Push, Skirmish, and Firefight which supports up to 12. All three are enjoyable in their own right and offer sufficiently unique experiences, but Firefight stands well above the rest. The objective is deceptively simple: kill everyone on the other team or take all three uncontested capture points, whichever comes first. The catch is that because dead players can only respawn if their team takes an objective, the ensuing high-stakes strategy makes each match enjoyable and replayable. The tension is similar to that felt in Counter-Strike\u2019s Bomb Defusal or Hostage Rescue, but with the chance for redemption after death. The six maps are at their best in this small-scale setting, but even here the unintuitive boundaries managed to frustrate me ever so often.  Artificially imposed \u201crestricted areas\u201d announce their presence with bright-red on-screen text and an angry AI callout when you step over their invisible borders. The problem is that there is usually no visual language in either the map design or HUD that distinguishes where these boundaries are, and many can simply be ignored to unfairly access a legal area. This makes learning the ins and outs of where you can and cannot go in a particular portion of a particular map on a particular mode total guesswork. And to really drive the ambiguity home, trespassing in different restricted areas result in different punishments. For instance, going straight out of bounds prompts a timer that will kill you if you remain, staying in an in-bounds restricted area for too long disables your weapon, but ducking into a restricted zone for only a few seconds carries no perceptible punishment. This means that in many cases these boundaries serves no functional purpose other than to confuse everybody.  It just feels sloppy to have so many restricted areas so close to the objectives. \u201c For instance, you can simply bulldoze through restricted areas at multiple points on Precinct in the Push mode to flank enemies from an unexpected angle. Conversely, if you think you\u2019re safe because your flank is blocked by territory that\u2019s restricted to the enemy team, you\u2019re probably not. Furthermore, it just feels sloppy to have so many restricted areas so close to the objectives themselves. And finally, these boundaries accentuate Precinct and Refinery\u2019s worst characteristics - their linear and narrow design. Elsewhere, Crossing is barren to a fault, Hideout opens with a nightmare of a chokepoint on Security Push, and fighting through the densest parts of Summit took a toll on my performance. On the whole, the maps betray Insurgency: Sandstorm\u2019s humble origins more than any other element when compared to its big-budget kin.  I\u2019ve seen a few minor bugs, but most are of the graphical and hopefully easy-to-fix variety. I can only think of three larger issues worthy of bringing up: there is no way to disable the hysteria-inducing mic chirp noises of allied players even if you mute them, initiating a vault over an obstacle can be noticeably finicky, and on two occasions my gun inexplicably refused to fire for a few seconds\u2026 and yes, it was loaded. Some players have complained about a low framerate, but my experience on both a GeForce 2080 TI and 1070 I\u2019ve only seen minor performance issues on the Summit map.  Maintaining a level playing field while also rewarding time invested means that progression in Insurgency: Sandstorm is purely aesthetic in nature. Each of the 33 firearms and the dozen or so attachments are unlocked from the very get-go, with the only limiting factors being your class, faction, and loadout points. The Breacher class, for example, has different primary weapon choices than the Gunner, but each has the same amount of points to customize their guns and gear as they see fit. Tinkering with point distribution proved to be a fun process of trial and error. If you want an absolutely decked out primary, for example, you can ax your explosives, armor, and secondary weapon and dump all of those points into attachments like a suppressor, foregrip, laser sight, and optic.   You may not always get to play as your favored class, though, because most roles have a limit on how many people are allowed to play them at a time. Playing as the Marksman, is a first-come, first-served endeavor. However, I was never particularly disappointed at the prospect of being forced into the plain-old Rifleman role, as that basic class offers fantastic versatility and has no problem competing with more specialized archetypes.  While most of the eight classes simply offer exclusive weaponry, the Observer and Commander are clear outliers. A Commander can call in powerful ordnance like chemical mortars, drone bombers, or a helicopter gunship \u2013 but only if the radio-operating Observer is standing close by. Crucially, all members of this fire support team need to be alive to get anything done.  When you\u2019ve cut your teeth on the versus playlist you can up the stakes in a ranked competitive queue. Here a lengthier version of Firefight with five players on each team serves as the only mode and weapons, attachments, and equipment are all much more expensive, resulting in the use of barebones loadouts. Communication is key, and comms remain active even after you\u2019ve died. While my experience in ranked is limited I love what I\u2019ve played so far \u2013 the competitive playlist makes Sandstorm\u2019s best mode even better. With that said, I think the inclusion of seasonal ranked rewards would be a welcome incentive to increase the apparently barren matchmaking pool. Finally, there is a tutorial and cooperative versus AI mode if you need a bit of practice before heading into multiplayer."

        "Subtitle": "More disguise than robot. ",
        "Content": "The root of most movie tie-in games' problems: time. Too-short development cycles, last-minute plot changes (realistic for shooting schedules, but murder for level design and game pacing)... the list goes on. And time feels like it's at the root of all of Transformers: Dark of the Moon's problems. Too much time spent waiting for things to happen. Too much time doing the same things over and over. Too little time spent as a robot-out-of-disguise. And not enough time to beat (or even meet) expectations as the follow-up to the best Transformers game ever, last year's Transformers: War for Cybertron. Transformers: Dark of the Moon carries over much of what made War for Cybertron great. A hybrid of third-person shooter and vehicle combat, the game allows you to shift between vehicle and robot form at will, and each Transformer has its own particular abilities and strengths. While the ability to pick up new weapons is gone, each character has distinctive tools of destruction that are typically pretty interesting to use. Some significant mechanical changes rear their heads, too -- vehicle mode now defaults to Stealth Force, where you have so many weapons, your Transformers is literally splitting at the seams (no, really -- guns poke out of every orifice ). It seems like a cool idea, and it is... until you realize that this is the first of several small changes that drastically alter the way the game plays. The thing is, in Stealth Force mode, your character can take much more punishment than he can in robot form -- a 180 from War for Cybertron. The weapons you carry in robot form have to be reloaded all the time, but your Stealth Force cannons come equipped with endless piles of ammunition. Put simply, you rarely have much reason to run around in robot form. Everything you can do on legs, you can do more effectively on wheels (or hoverpads, or whatever). imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F117%2F1176563%2Ftransformers-dark-of-the-moon-20110503014722222_1308173561-000.jpg&caption= This creates a strange dynamic where you wind up staying in vehicle form until the last moment possible, then shifting to robot and back. The alternative is to die unexpectedly from a sudden wave of enemies tossing grenades and firing balls of death in your general direction. And on normal difficulty and above, you will die. In robot form, you're downright fragile, but even in Stealth Force mode, you're likely to find yourself overwhelmed with few points of cover to duck behind. This is partly due to level design that feels sparse at the best of times; Transformers: Dark of the Moon usually feels like taffy stretched too far. The giant, expansive journey through War for Cybertron's alien world is replaced by small levels whose playtime is artificially expanded by the \"survive multiple waves of bad guys in a locked room\" motif. Some of the levels showcase interesting ideas, and certain outdoor locations show off some really fantastic lighting and color, but moments of inspired design are few. Even the parts that involve travel over large areas are surrounded by cliff faces or giant concrete walls or... you get the idea. War for Cybertron fans will be disappointed to learn that the three-player cooperative play and Escalation survival modes haven't returned in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but things are saved somewhat by the returning competitive multiplayer mode. Once again, developer High Moon Studios brings a unique online experience to bear -- the ability to transform adds mobility and strategic options that other multiplayer shooters can't reasonably replicate. But some of the campaign's basic problems persist in multiplayer, particularly the robot/Stealth-Force/vehicle trinity. The nature of firefights has changed, and I'm not sure it's for the better. It's still fun, but the removal of support classes and enhanced durability of vehicles eliminates some of the lightning-fast back-and-forth inherent in War for Cybertron's team deathmatch and conquest modes. It also removes some of the fun.",

        "Content": "Ask Tom Brady and Matt Ryan what they think about halftime adjustments. Those adjustments, major or minor, are the key to winning any football game \u2013 the types of championship-caliber adjustments we hoped for from Madden\u2019s move to the Frostbite Engine in Madden NFL 18. The engine has enhanced the graphics dramatically and added an immense amount of detail to the absolutely wonderful Longshot story mode, but EA Sports misses the opportunity to really make its mark by refreshing the gameplay in meaningful ways.  While playing a rematch of last season\u2019s Patriots vs. Falcons Super Bowl, it was easy to get distracted by the lighting effects and the improved body types, which, to my eye, have both taken the largest leap of any of Madden 18\u2019s graphical upgrades. While watching a replay I noticed details like how the glimmer of the sun flickered off of a receiver\u2019s helmet, and even while referees are announcing penalties you can see that the glare in their faces is real.  The body types brought a second glance from the moment I turned on Madden NFL 18. Players still look a bit stiff and can run into each other while walking around between plays, but each position and body type is well represented, which is more than previous Maddens can say. And while it\u2019s a smaller touch, stadium and uniform detail have really stuck out to me. The pop from the Seahawks\u2019 lime green and the Buccaneers\u2019 orange is a highly appreciated detail.  The new animations look great and aren\u2019t repetitive. \u201c On the more tangible side, the engine switch makes gameplay look more fluid thanks to enhanced movement and interaction animations. My expectations weren\u2019t too high considering FIFA\u2019s first foray with Frostbite encountered speed bumps from using old animations in the new engine, but Madden doesn\u2019t encounter the same problems. The new animations look great and aren\u2019t repetitive, and so do the one-on-one interactions are strong and fluid in every activity I\u2019ve seen (line play, secondary coverage, and tackling). When I picked off Russell Wilson in the red zone, my DB was tripped up by Doug Baldwin, and when I took a closer look at the replay the animation was spot on. (It\u2019s a shame that to truly appreciate the animations you need to watch the replays, but I highly recommend taking the time to do it.) Gang tackling looks smoother as well, but we still see bowling pins and unnatural-looking rag dolls on occasion.   The new Target Passing mechanic, which allows you to lead your pass catcher, is a doozy to learn (or maybe I\u2019m just terrible at it) because it moves extremely fast and demands on-point precision. I don\u2019t always complete a pass, but I\u2019m slowly getting the hang of it and how to lead correctly. I don\u2019t think accuracy ratings play into the mechanic, which turns it into a mini-game inside the passing game. I don\u2019t see the point of the mechanic because it doesn\u2019t give me any reason as to why it\u2019s better or a preferred way to be more accurate. Open practice is going to be your friend while learning how to use this, but I\u2019ll stick with traditional button passing.  Target Passing doesn\u2019t give me any reason as to why it\u2019s better. \u201c Though it\u2019s easy to see the graphical improvements, the real star of Madden NFL 18 is its new story mode. EA Sports finally breathes life into the single-player side with the introduction of Longshot mode: a fantastic story-based experience using a strong cast of motion-captured actors and a well-written script that kept me engaged with RPG-style decision making. Its storytelling sequences make great use of the more lifelike graphics \u2013 imagining what it would\u2019ve looked like with last year\u2019s engine made me appreciate Frostbite\u2019s upgrades even more.  A good single-player experience is a significant development for this series because it\u2019s been without one for four years. Madden\u2019s old solo mode, Superstar, was a waste of space and barely worth discussing. Thankfully, EA Sports eventually saw the light and dropped it after last publishing the mode in Madden NFL 13, which left Franchise as the only real single-player option. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so used to Madden being relegated to a fun, dynamic game of multiplayer football with my best friends, and of course the ever-growing online community. And that was great, but it wasn\u2019t a good look for the NFL\u2019s exclusive console game to lack a strong solo option while single-player modes are doing great things in other sports genres like NBA 2K and EA\u2019s own FIFA series.   But in Madden NFL 18, EA Sports has created a theatrical-quality, immersive, emotional, and educational single-player experience that had me glued to my TV for its five-hour run. The Longshot story mode \u2013 an adventure that takes you through the life of former blue chip quarterback Devin Wade as he makes his way through high school, college, and the NFL \u2013 captured my attention as a student of the game and kept me coming back to find out what happened next.  The Longshot is a single-player experience that has me glued to my TV. \u201c While walking in Wade\u2019s shoes, I encountered a sense of accountability I\u2019d never felt in a sports game before. The script is very well written, and stays interactive with Mass Effect-like decisions and button prompts that will affect your football IQ, draft grade, and social standing. Even something as trivial as choosing to post a semi-crude video to social media can impact your story. I was torn down by my coach for calling the wrong play and brutally hammered by the media when a press conference quickly got out of hand, and for every big or small mistake I made, I felt bad for Wade because of the repercussions. Those choices felt meaningful on my first playthrough, but after playing 50 percent through for a second time to test their impact on the outcome it\u2019s become clear that Longshot\u2019s story is linear with a few alternate scenes and endings.  It\u2019s interesting that Longshot doesn\u2019t rely much on Madden\u2019s traditional football gameplay to succeed. Through the first two hours of the campaign, there was nothing more than a few button games and a quick challenge on the field. But once you hit the halfway point the gameplay kicks it up a notch and becomes a focal point as you begin to encounter former NFL stars throughout the mode.   After the ending, Madden seamlessly transitions you straight to Madden Ultimate Team (MUT) mode, instantly filing your collectible-card lineup with players, coaches, stadiums, and uniforms from Longshot. There are also 27 solo challenges in MUT that let you live relive key moments from Wade\u2019s past, present, and future. The best challenges are reminiscent of the NCAA Football franchise, as you\u2019re controlling the University of Texas vs. the Oregon Ducks with the NCAA theme song playing in the background. It\u2019s a respectful nod to EA Sports\u2019 historic and highly regarded but dormant college franchise. Plus, there\u2019s an opportunity for EA Sports to release new challenges and cards that relate to Longshot throughout the year, potentially keeping the mode somewhat relevant for longer than launch period.  Squad Up  I have never been a fan of the grind that comes with the collectible card modes, but this year I was enticed to give Madden Ultimate Team a wholehearted chance with the Longshot elements and the new 3v3 competitive mode, MUT Squads, and was pleasantly surprised.  I could see Squads catching on with competitive esports teams \u201c You and two other players team up and fill the Offensive Captain, Defensive Captain, and Head Coach roles. The on-field team is a mix of the three users\u2019 Ultimate Team lineups, opening up some really cool possibilities of creating a star-studded team at random. As a foundation, I love the idea, and I could see Squads catching on with competitive esports teams. In fact, I strongly recommend playing with a premade team you know, because some of the games I played with matchmaking were a much worse experience thanks to a lack of communication and a wide disparity in skill level. But winning as a team is much more fulfilling than winning a one-on-one match.   The other notable difference between MUT Squads and standard Madden gameplay is that the standard camera angle here is zoomed out pretty far, giving it a different feel. Controlling the smaller players takes a minute to get used to, but once I got the hang of it I appreciated the wide-open space and seeing my teammates run with me. I used the camera view to break a long touchdown run with Barry Sanders, something I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do as strategically in the default camera angle.  Another good tweak this year is the ability to play offline and in Franchise mode with three distinct gameplay styles: Arcade, Simulation, and Competitive. This addresses a long-standing frustration I\u2019ve had with the series, in that I play Madden regularly with a handful of friends and acquaintances who all like to play in different ways. Some like to score as many points as possible and go for it on 4th-and-28. Others will delete my number from their phone if I ever go for it on fourth down early in the game while on my side of the field. It\u2019s all about our own styles. So it\u2019s a relief to see that those styles are now officially supported in Madden NFL 18.  Arcade provides tons of scoring, limits penalties, and removes injuries entirely. Plus, the hit stick and fancy ball-carrier moves have an increased chance at succeeding, leading to more of the \u201cWow!\u201d moments that I crave when playing for bragging rights. During my first game in Arcade mode, I launched an 80-yard bomb to the Titans\u2019 Corey Davis for a quick score, only to be on the receiving end of a similar big play courtesy of Russell Wilson only three plays later. It\u2019s a great mode for beginners and those looking to have a quick and entertaining game of Madden, especially considering the AI tends to be on the forgiving side of things.  Simulation, which has always been my preferred style, gives the hardcore \u201cSim Nation\u201d fanbase what it wants: an authentic NFL experience built upon stick skills and player ratings where penalties and injuries stay consistent. While using Simulation in Franchise, it encourages proper team building and play calling giving you the most realistic Sunday possible.  Competitive is the final piece of the Madden puzzle, and one that will hopefully show the acceptance of Madden\u2019s growing eSports community over time. Competitive really started to grow on me while I was in matchmaking (by the way \u2013 Madden has the most stable online servers of all the sports games). This mode is heavily weighted on stick skill, which made it that much more fulfilling when pulling out a win online. The improved ball hawk mechanics shine in this play style, as mastering the timing on errant throws can really add to your interception rate.  18 Images  Another new mode, Play Now Live, allows you to follow along the real-life NFL season with in-game challenges to rewrite history, or imagine it before it happens. As an added bonus, the commentary is already updated with chatter of the NFL\u2019s first week of preseason, which gives sophomore commentators Brandon Gaudin and Charles David fresh conversational material (which they sorely needed after a limp debut last year). This week, for instance, I played the preseason matchup between the Rams and Raiders, where the commentary of the big Sammy Watkins trade ruled the conversation. Once the game is completed, you can move right into Franchise mode to play out the rest of the season. Outside of the updated commentary, Play Now Live is lifeless, giving no reason to sit down and play awhile.  Finally, it\u2019s a bit disappointing that my favorite mode, Franchise, went almost completely untouched from last year\u2019s version to this one. Tiny tweaks to the presentation were made, including lineup introductions showing full 3D model players rather than headshots. And the soundtrack is one of the better ones in recent years. But other than that, EA Sports\u2019 developers really meant it when they said at E3 that the focus would be entirely on Longshot and the port to Frostbite, and it sucks that I haven\u2019t been given a reason to fire up the new version."

        "Content": "I've never been as consistently interrupted while playing a game at the office as I was while playing through High Moon's Transformers: War for Cybertron . I would put on headphones and play for ten or fifteen minutes, and I would suddenly feel a tingle in that weird lizard-brain proximity sense we've all got that says \"someone is in my personal space bubble.\" I'd turn around and see another IGN editor standing behind my shoulder, staring at me with pleading eyes, and I always knew what they were going to ask before they asked it: \"is it good?\" It's the look of someone afraid of getting their hopes up.  Which is why I was happy to report to those asking that Transformers: War for Cybertron is actually very good. Fantastic, even. High Moon has taken a fun, fast, third person shooter foundation, crafted a well thought out transformation mechanic on top of it, and designed combat situations around that. The end result is a shooter that has an identity all its own, and leverages its license to make something very cool for fans and newcomers alike.   More Transformers: War for Cybertron News & Previews Set millenia before the original cartoon series that fans have taken to calling G1, Transformers: War for Cybertron tells the story of the final days of the Autobot's and Decepticon's civil war on the surface of their homeworld, Cybertron. Officially sanctioned as canon by Hasbro, War for Cybertron fills in some gaps in fans' understanding of Transformers lore, explaining things like Starscream's defection from the Autobots, Optimus's succession to the position of Prime, and more. High Moon's storytelling is generally good, and feels well situated in the Transformers fiction -- it's a good modernization of the original cartoon while remaining true to the characters and stories that fans have placed on a pedestal for decades -- but there are points where the narrative jumps sloppily from one event to the next. It feels at times as though we're watching a show with episodes missing, and though there's a pre-level text crawl that does a decent job of filling in some of the details, it's still jarring cutting so quickly from triumph to despair and back again without in-game exposition.  However, while the story occasionally stumbles, High Moon's love and attention to detail with regards to G1 Transformers remains vitally palpable throughout. High Moon covers all of their bases and more in establishing their Transformers cred, as it were, even while making minor changes here and there in the interest of gameplay and plausibility. While some fans might rankle at the prospect of Soundwave transforming into a sort of Cybertronian truck, there's a point a couple of hours into the Autobot campaign that should provide ample compensation. Their redesigns of well-known Transformer archetypes like Bumblebee and Soundwave feel current and cool while remaining instantly recognizable.  With the many small details (like constantly moving pistons and gears on each Transformer in humanoid mode, as well as some great transformations), High Moon does a great job of straddling a line between fan service and respect that other games referencing revered properties often trip over. While I could have lived with a little less \"BLAM!\" from Warpath, it's hard to argue with Peter Cullen's contributions as Optimus.    Surprisingly, though, the story and treatment of the Transformers fiction isn't where War for Cybertron sees the most success. In interviews leading up to War for Cybertron's release, Executive Producer Matt Tieger stressed that the team at High Moon prioritized strong gameplay fundamentals. Rather than contriving a reason for cover based shooting in a Transformers title, High Moon has instead gone with a more immediate third-person dynamic that emphasizes up close melee combat just as much as shooting, with great results.  Transformation in War for Cybertron isn't just a gimmick; levels and encounters are designed around the ability to shift at will between vehicle and humanoid forms, and from early on, a mastery of both forms and knowing when to use them is practically a requirement. High Moon has created a shooter that rewards both strategic thinking and heavy experimentation. From double-jumping into a dash to melee a jet in mid-air, to using a detachable turret on one group of enemies then quick turning 180 degrees as a tank to take out another, to kicking into the air to transform into a jet to use flanking tactics on an enemy position, combat in Transformers: War for Cybertron is more satisfying than any third person shooter in recent memory.  While most players will most likely jump immediately into the cooperative campaign mode in Transformers: War for Cybertron, competitive multiplayer is where the game will find its legs. Marrying aspects of Unreal Championship with Tribes and the class-based finesse of games like Team Fortress 2 and Bad Company 2, War for Cybertron leverages its transformation mechanic to create something that feels shockingly new. The same combat scenarios that make the singleplayer campaign of the game so much fun are present in fast-forward online, as Scientist-class jets scream overhead and Soldiers, Scouts, and Leaders mix it up on the ground. While matches are capped at 10 players, in practice this expertly skirts an almost-too-frantic vibe from games that support far more combatants at once. Conquest mode is a particular favorite, as the momentum between the Autobot and Decepticon sides can change abruptly at the drop of a hat, making for matches that stay interesting.   Transformers: War for Cybertron at IGN.com  Is War for Cybertron perfect? No, of course not. The framerate can take a hit at a few points, and some boss battles occasionally devolve into exercises in avoiding instant or near-instant death to shoot the red flashy thing. Transformers nerds will love the character customization for each class with multiple chassis and customizable paint jobs in multiplayer while simultaneously lamenting its limitations. But these nitpicks are small in light of everything War for Cybertron does fantastically well. "

        "Content": "Two weeks ago, we published a generally unflattering article in which we laid out our first impressions of Saga , a new MMO from Silverlode Interactive . Given the tremendous uphill climb that most MMOs endure during their first few months, we wanted to wait a few weeks before offering up our final review. The team has squashed a few more bugs and improved the overall presentation but, even with these improvements, the fundamental frustrations of the gameplay still kept popping up in the same old places. While we love to see developers taking chances and pushing the boundaries of what we've come to expect, it feels like the team at Silverlode Interactive just bit off more than they could chew with Saga. The ambitious nature of the project is impossible to deny; the massively multiplayer online real-time strategy collectible card game sounds like it would be appealing to a wide range of gamers, but the truth is that there are just so many moving parts here that even the Sonys and Microsofts of this world would be hesitant to take it all on at once.  Players can choose from a variety of traditional fantasy factions, each of which can lead an army of troops appropriate to their type. Dwarves get axemen, dark elves get sorcerers; you know the routine. After picking a city type (which still seems kind of arbitrary), you'll be plopped down in the world. At your city you can order the construction of new buildings, direct your peasant work force, and recruit armies before heading out to seek your quests. Clicking on a quest in the overland map gives you a bit of story about the quest and then transports your forces to that particular battlefield. You select your starting troops, kick the snot out of whoever's opposing you and then head back to your city to start it all over again. The quests themselves start out a bit repetitive but things open up a bit later on. The objectives almost always involve capturing something or destroying all the enemy units, but to max out your experience and loot gains, you'll probably want to do both in any case. Most quests can be repeated at higher difficulty levels for greater rewards but you're likely to need the help of other players. Still, there are so many quests here that you can effectively solo through the game with little need to actually interact with others. Unfortunately, there's not much going on tactically. Your units have a few different formations, but all these amount to are just simple stances that you can switch between depending on whether you're being attacked by melee or ranged units. Any concept of fronts, flanking or maintaining groups of units in their own formation just don't seem to apply here. Worse yet, the formations don't matter at all in terms of impeding a unit's movement, so those nasty beast riders can just walk right through your carefully positioned pikemen and charge right into your archers. Of course, you can take advantage of this as well. There are some missions that ask you to run a gauntlet of enemy forces. Just select your starting forces and click their destination on the other side of the map and you can go make a sandwich.  The enemy usually puts up a good fight but that's due more to numbers and event scripts than actual tactics. Sure, the enemy knows to keep his archers in the rear and his swordsmen up front, but he doesn't know how to gather distant troops together for a  massed attack or to send out a sortie when your long-range artillery units are smashing his gates. We've stood outside enemy fortifications and reduced them to rubble before the enemy force, who just happened to be standing on the other side of those gates, ever stirred. The one thing that we really do like about the tactical side of the game is the way you can create and field your own armies. Rather than just giving you a generic set of units, Saga ties army creation in to the whole collectible card game scheme. Players can buy booster packs that unlock new unit cards that can be used either to recruit new unit types into their own armies, or traded through the in-game marketplace for other cards. Since each faction has unique cards, you'll wind up with some that you have no use for that might nevertheless be very attractive to other players. And even beyond that, there's a lot of thought and planning that has to go into how you create an army. You'll have to build units of the appropriate size and equip them with the various weapons and armors you've looted during battles. Since the size of a unit limits how many you can field at a time (and how many you can put out as reinforcements throughout the battle) you'll have some careful balancing and number crunching to do. Add in the fact that the units each gain experience and you'll really start to create an army that reflects the way you want to play. The only real pain about this system is that units resurrected between battles have to be replaced by hand. It stands to reason that if I'm paying to bring a soldier back to life; I'm going to want him to go back and rejoin his old unit, right? So why do I have to add him manually. It's a real waste of time and something that I hope the developers plan to fix soon. Unfortunately, the aspect of Saga that most clearly identifies it as an MMO is the chat window. Currently there's no central forum for groups of players to gather together and participate in the types of cooperative and competitive types of play that are, in essence, the game's only excuse for calling itself an MMO. Right now you can set up your own battles for other players to join, but apart from shouting LFG in the general chat window, there aren't any highly visible ways to advertise your desire to play with other players. You can, of course, always catch the odd multiplayer match lingering for a few moments in the war window, but that's kind of a random process.  To be completely fair, we expect that Silverlode is working to provide some kind of central hub to advertise players looking for matches (or matches looking for players). They'd be crazy not to include it and we can only assume that its absence is due to the game's rushed launch. A system that flagged the quests on your map based on whether players were currently looking to play as a group would be a nice start. When you do manage to link up with other players, Saga begins to shine, but just a little. The missions themselves can be just as repetitive and predictable as before, but at least you'll have someone else there to throw a little tactical (not to mention conversational) stimulation your way. There's also a PVP option where players can raid each other's territories, but it's not very well documented. The same is true of the overall empire management options available in the game. Silverlode has finally offered up an in-game manual to players, and it actually reveals some of the things that we'd been curious about over the last few weeks. Still, not having that information available at launch may have discouraged players who might otherwise have enjoyed the game. As is usual with most MMOs, there are plenty of features that are only just now starting to get off the ground, but basic information about how to play the game should have arrived much sooner than now. We're not any more impressed with the graphics than we were two weeks ago. The unit models are primitive by today's standards and the monotonous appearance and animations are best viewed from an extreme distance. We definitely like the range of invention shown in the units, from golems to dragons to knights, but the problem is that the selection of types is so familiar that you're bound to have seen virtually every element of this game ten times over already. At this point, we'd like to have seen either more detail or, failing that, at least more inventiveness. The same is true of the rather predictable effects and environments.  Sound effects are thin and just don't communicate the drama of the battles they're supposed to represent. We speculated in our initial impressions piece about just what those noises might actually be in real life, but in any case, they're not strong enough to support the action on screen. The music, on the other hand, is actually quite good and serves to get us in the right frame of mind for the game."

At first glance, you might not notice too much that\u2019s wildly different about Splatoon 3\u2019s multiplayer options when compared to its predecessors, but diving into its ink-covered warzones reveals a heaping helping of quality-of-life changes lurking just below the surface. It has better lobby systems, multiple practice ranges, and even more customization options to make your character shine \u2013 not to mention stylish new weapons and terrifying new Salmon Run foes that mix up its familiar formula in exciting ways. It may forego any drastic additions or changes, but Splatoon 3 skillfully fine-tunes everything that made its team-based multiplayer so extremely compelling already. For those not familiar with Nintendo\u2019s cephalopod shooter, Splatoon\u2019s main multiplayer modes pit two teams of four against each other, using ink-spewing weapons to satisfyingly coat both the ground and your enemies in shiny goop. Your squid or octo-based character can seamlessly shift forms to glide through your team\u2019s ink and rapidly advance, popping up out to fire a variety of weapons and build out further territory. Splatoon 3\u2019s main mode \u2014 Turf Wars \u2014 tasks your team with covering the most ground before time runs out, while other modes for more experienced players add in specific objectives like protecting payloads or towers. The modes themselves may not have changed here, but they are still as fun as ever, bolstered by new weapons, specials, and tactical moves to take advantage of within them. Nintendo Switch OLED Splatoon 3 Special Edition 7 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Matches are as fast as they are frantic, but are approachable enough that anyone can easily get into them and have a blast. Even if you miss inking another player to eliminate them in Turf Wars, you\u2019ll still be inadvertently painting the ground to help your team towards victory. Splatoon 3 has also made a smart tweak by moving your starting position and respawn point from an easily abused spot on the ground to launchpads up in the air, letting you pick which part of your base to launch into (and see where your teammates are going to launch), or check the map to easily target a teammate on the field to give them backup. This does wonders for letting teams escape getting camped in their own starting area, so long as they coordinate their efforts. I really came to like the tall towers in Scorch Gorge that made for excellent sniping spots. \u201c Each map is nearly symmetrical, with tricky terrain elements that offer tactical opportunities like mesh walkways to slip through, ink rails to zip along, paths to ambush from above, and multiple routes with different strategic advantages. The Turf Wars mode in particular never loses its chaotic fun, as there are plenty of chances for last second comebacks and extremely close matches. Even if your team gets totally demolished, the quick match time for all of its modes ensures you\u2019ll be back at it again in no time, and the calling of \u201cjust one more match\u201d is hard to shake. Many of the best maps from previous Splatoon iterations have returned \u2014- that includes Mahi-Mahi Resort and its changing water level that reveals more turf to ink, as well as the MakoMart that has you splatting foes along the aisles of a giant supermarket. Of its new additions, I really came to like the tall towers in Scorch Gorge that made for excellent sniping spots (or points to ambush using the new Zipcaster special), and the Hagglefish Market\u2019s various routes that let me tear through boxes of debris. Most maps are tweaked slightly for ranked battles to allow the addition of moving towers or goals, but they all provide lasting fun whether you\u2019re trying grinding against other competitive players or casually repping your chosen team during the new three-way Splatfest events. One great change from Splatoon 2 is the ability to keep playing with your current group to let the good times continue to roll (both for PvP and PvE modes). It\u2019s awesome to be able to stick with a good group of random players after a win, and even nicer to not have to remake a group with your friends after every match when you just want to have some more relaxed fun together. The only downside I\u2019ve noticed is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to cancel out of matchmaking when you choose to stay together, which seems like an odd oversight that left me in matchmaking purgatory a few times when the rest of the group bailed. As you level up from playing matches, you\u2019ll be able to browse Splatoon 3\u2019s huge assortment of weapons, which range from traditional blasters and speed-increasing ink rollers to literal paint buckets and precise snipers. All of Splatoon 2\u2019s best options can be found among those offered at the store, including two new weapon types. The allure of the Splatana (a giant squeegee on a wiper blade) caught my sword-loving eyes, though I have yet to master its extremely precise swipes that emit projectiles that remind me of The Legend of Zelda\u2019s Master Sword. The other new armament is a bow called the Tri Stringer, which can be charged up to unleash three ink bolts that explode after a short pause. It\u2019s a fun concept that has great potential in pinning down foes or keeping them away from objectives. What We Said About Splatoon 3's Single-Player Splatoon 3\u2019s single-player campaign takes all the highs of Splatoon 2\u2019s creative Octo Expansion missions and places them in a satisfying hub world where freedom of choice lets you get as much as you want out of your playthrough \u2014 confident that you\u2019ll be back for more. Even when it relies heavily on familiar enemies, smart level design and objectives, and bosses brimming with personality keep things fresh for the whole ride. Score: 8 Read the full single-player review. Each weapon is paired with a special move, and the sheer variety of both new and returning specials add a wonderful sense of unpredictable mayhem to the battlefield. From deployable shield domes to buff dispensers and exploding dolphins (complete with an \u201cAkira slide\u201d), I encountered many instances where a well-timed special turned the tide for my team at the last moment. My favorite by far has been the Zipcaster, letting me tether and fling myself to almost any surface, which has opened up so many fun new opportunities for ambushes and taking down sniper nests \u2014 though it\u2019s extremely limited duration before I\u2019m sent back to where I started is a clever way to keep it from being abused. Earlier Splatoon games required players to accumulate currency from matches to buy different weapons, but Splatoon 3 has done a great job anticipating the needs of returning players in order to make weapon acquisition easier. Here you get a token each time you level up (or level up an armament from repeated use) that can be exchanged for one weapon, and while there\u2019s a slow but steady roll-out of beginner friendly weapons at first, you can also choose to spend three tokens to pick out any weapon regardless of its level requirement. This benefits both veterans who want to go right to their favorite, and also newer players who might not want to wait 10 levels to get another bucket-type armament if they\u2019ve come to love the one they\u2019ve been using early on. Splatoon 3 has done a great job anticipating the needs of returning players. \u201c In fact, many of the new tweaks and changes in Splatoon 3 seem to have its experienced players (especially competitive ones) in mind. You\u2019ll find not just one or two, but four different firing ranges to try out weapons depending on where you are and which mode you\u2019re practicing for. The inclusion of a Recon Mode is also an extremely welcome one, letting you freely explore any of its 12 launch maps in order to get an understanding of the level's terrain and choke points on your own. After playing multiplayer matches, you can now view replays of your last 50 battles too, which included a wealth of great options like being able to swap to another player\u2019s view on either team with a quick button press, or quickly scrub through the timeline and set up highlights to share online. The best addition by far is the new lobby, as you will no longer be trapped in a nebulous menu while you wait for matchmaking to begin. There\u2019s now a wonderful open space to wander where you can see holograms of your friends to check what they\u2019re up to (or if they have a spot you can join), and make use of the giant practice range\u2019s many neat features \u2014 and even clean up all the ink with the press of a button. In between matches, you can quickly swap out stat-boosting clothing and weapons (something that wasn\u2019t available when Splatoon 2 first debuted), and also see other players running around the practice range before the next match starts. The best addition by far is the new lobby. \u201c Not only are these new additions sorely needed, they\u2019re presented in a cool and stylish way that perfectly echoes the fresh fashion and design of Splatsville. A locker room even lets you customize your very own cubby with stickers and gear as another place to express your personality, or create dioramas as quirky and bizarre as the player social posts and art that can appear all over the square. You\u2019ll also earn new titles, badges, banners, and more that add even more customizable style to your inkling character \u2014 many of which can be gained from a new Battle Pass system (that thankfully requires no opt-in purchases) that\u2019s given me yet another great reason to keep diving back into multiplayer. Splatoon 3 still holds a strict and sometimes nonsensical insistence on gating certain features that were present in previous incarnations. I understand why new players really should try playing Turf War before anything else \u2014 including the PvE Salmon Run mode that unlocks at level four, and the ranked objective modes in Anarchy Battles that unlock at level ten \u2014 but you\u2019re also banned from shops and even your own locker room until level four for reasons I\u2019m still trying to justify. Even the mediocre new tabletop card game seems needlessly gated, despite it being only against AI for the time being. At least for those returning players with Splatoon 2 save data, you\u2019ll be able to hop right into ranked battles and buy a few choice weapons early on. What is your favorite Splatoon Weapon Type? Shooters Blasters Chargers Rollers Brushes Sloshers Splatlings Dualies Brellas Splatanas Stringers Answer See Results The aforementioned PvE Salmon Run has returned, and thankfully it\u2019s now available to queue up for 24/7 instead of the bizarre decision the previous game made to close it down for hours at a time. You\u2019ll still be given random weapons from a set as you and three other players battle hordes of encroaching Salmonids, and the new Splatana and Tri Stringer can really shine here. I particularly love the new intro that showcases you and your buddies preparing to launch out of a helicopter like you\u2019ve been dropped into Metal Gear Solid 5. The act of surviving waves of enemies while collecting golden eggs from the various boss monsters that show up is still a lot of fun, and there are some great new tweaks here too. Most notable among those changes is the ability to launch a golden egg you\u2019re carrying ahead of you like a grenade. This opens up a huge realm of possibilities for maximizing your time on a map as you can bank shots like a pro basketball player. Working to create an egg tossing relay with my team was incredibly satisfying, and proved even a random group without voice chat could sync up like a well-oiled machine. Of course, the tradeoff is that launching eggs requires a ton of stored ink just like a grenade, and may leave you vulnerable and out of ammo as a result \u2014 which is another great risk vs. reward choice to introduce to a mode already full of them. These modes are only great when fighting with or against other players, which is something I haven\u2019t been able to do enough of quite yet. \u201c New boss enemies also bring fresh strategies to the mix, like the \u201cFish Stick\u201d that drops a giant spire into the ground to harass you from above. Being able to take them out and then use their pillar as an attack point is a great touch. To reward players for repeated wins, a new Godzilla-like salmon boss can now appear too if you\u2019ve been on a roll, and the atmosphere instantly changes when it does. Instead of stockpiling eggs, you\u2019re encouraged to use them as ammo to launch into the beast to take it down \u2014 but you\u2019ll still be rewarded for making it as far as you have even if your team is defeated. Defeating this fishy kaiju also lets you unlock even more exclusive rewards, which is a great way to show off your salmon-hunting prowess to the masses, and gives even more reasons to keep coming back to survive the ever more difficult waves."

        "id": "a9bbe7f419c2a652fab9f9c1892f8cfe",
        "Content": "The American West has made actors famous and writers rich. It has inspired children on the playground and grizzled country singers alike. Its stories of heroes and bandits, gold rushes and simple homesteaders have been fictionalized and romanticized to the point that they're known the world over. And yet, video game makers have either ignored the setting or attempted to squeeze it into existing game conventions with limited success. That has all changed now that Rockstar, the group made famous for its Grand Theft Auto series, turned its eye towards the Wild West. No game maker has approached the period with as much passion and power as Red Dead Redemption . This is the new bar that all Westerns must strive to reach.  Check out our full video: Why We Love Red Dead Redemption. It's tempting to say that Red Dead Redemption is ahead of its time, but the reality is that this is a game of and for the times. Rockstar shows an uncanny ability to hold a mirror up to society and remind us that present day hot button issues like racism, immigration, federal government power and personal freedoms are not only nothing new, they are deeply ingrained in American society. They are forces that helped to shape America into what it is, and their inclusion in Red Dead Redemption gives it a sense of authenticity that videogames in general lack. But rather than preaching politics at you, Red Dead Redemption puts you in the shoes of the relatively neutral John Marston. This former outlaw gone straight has found that history has a way of catching up with you. Those who were once his friends have now become enemies, leaving Marston alone and fighting for his future in a lawless land. It's a setup that is almost cliche, but this is only the beginning of your adventure. The storyline of Red Dead Redemption will take you all over a vast swath of countryside that straddles the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Along the way you'll meet, assist, and spill blood with a fantastic cast of supporting characters as Marston attempts to set things straight. The characters are wonderful with top notch dialogue and voice acting -- all good enough to make you feel a part of the world. If there is any criticism I could level at the story, it's that Marston occasionally feels divorced from the action, his motivations muddled as he is all too willing to help anybody that asks for it despite his own pressing matters. A simple, \"I'm being made to do this,\" from Marston is all you'll get out of the protagonist for much of the game while secondary characters drive the tale along, which was a bit of a disappointment for me. This all changes towards the end, however, as Red Dead Redemption builds towards a shattering climax that is amongst the best I've ever seen in a video game. Following that main story will take you roughly 20 hours from start to finish, though most will find that there is so much to do that it is difficult to focus on one thing. This is made by Rockstar, after all, and their heritage as masters of the open world sandbox game is not lost. Herding cattle and breaking mustangs? Check. Tracking down outlaws for bounty? You can take them dead or alive. Treasure hunting and sharpshooting challenges? There are dozens of them. The side missions and quests range from the little things like playing horse shoes or poker to big shootouts at bandit hideouts. There are even some that are fleshed out enough to be a part of the main storyline. You could spend hours just riding around trying to track down all of the components of a new outfit for Marston, or hunting wild game and picking herbs and desert flowers. The Rockstar Social Club, a free online community that connects to the game, offers additional challenges and leaderboards to encourage even more replay. If you're looking for one game to occupy you for months, this is it.  As you begin to make a name for yourself, the world of Red Dead Redemption adapts to your fame. The question of ethics and morality is left up to the player. If you want to be a salty drunk that assaults women and robs stagecoaches , that's your prerogative. Others might prefer to help the needy and be more honorable . Though there is a legal system in Red Dead Redemption that will keep the most villainous in check, you're free to take the high or low road in most any situation. A little morality meter, alongside a separate fame bar tracks your actions and the citizens you come across will begin to react to your renown. It's a system that allows for a huge amount of freedom and then rewards you for exploring it. Like many Rockstar games, that freedom may ruffle a few feathers. Several of the actions you're able to perform will surely be considered indecent by some. But all of that is left up to the player, and as it turns out there isn't just a lot to do -- there's a lot to see . The world feels alive with something happening everywhere you turn. Birds come screaming out of the bushes as your horse thunders by. Trains whistle while storms come blowing in to fill low-lying areas with fresh puddles. Around the next bend might be a carriage being robbed by bandits, its poor inhabitants crying out for help, or there might be a cougar or bear ready to tear down your horse and bring Marston to his knees. Walk through town and you might see a drunk assaulting a prostitute, a lynch mob dragging a poor soul through the main drag, or a person who caught wind of your fame and has come looking for a duel. The simulation -- though its aggressive nature occasionally creates a goofy backdrop to Marston's conversations -- is always presenting something new and exciting.  Welcome to the Wild West.  What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie. Red Dead Redemption is a gorgeous game with an incredible attention to detail. The art direction, particularly the careful consideration paid to the color palette and geology of the land, is superb. Exactly the right amount of red is used to make the dusty hills and plateaus come to life, the sunsets look breathtaking, and the purple mountains call out with the majesty they're known for. The area you can explore is immense and dotted with towns, ruins, and different environments that all feel hand crafted and unique. Just ride out towards the sunset and listen to the exceptional soundtrack and you'll feel teleported to a whole new world. The setting of Red Dead Redemption, leaving out the interactive elements, is an achievement in itself. Add in the smooth way the world reacts and moves and you have a game that is stunning. Horses gallop realistically. Bodies dangling from those horses -- be it from a rope or from a foot caught in a stirrup -- animate near perfectly. Shoot a bandit in the hat and it will fly off, or aim for the legs and he'll stumble to the ground while you prepare to hogtie him. None of the animations are canned, which means every time you go out into the desert to play you'll have a slightly different and awesome outcome.  It's a gorgeous game.  The only slight detractor from this wonderful world is that Red Dead Redemption doesn't have quite the same level of polish as we've come to expect out of a Rockstar game. While playing I noticed the occasional bug (once during a cutscene the game rendered two of the same character doing different animations, creating a weird ghosting effect) and the game did freeze during loading a couple of times. The game's graphics engine can't always keep up with the action, either, resulting in some visual hiccups here or there. Given the scope of what has been accomplished here, Red Dead Redemption is actually a relatively smooth experience, but it isn't perfect. The developer's pedigree must also be mentioned when talking about the game itself. Some will describe Red Dead Redemption as Grand Theft Auto in the Wild West and in some ways that description is accurate. Many of the same presentational elements created in the GTA universe are used here, included extended conversations during rides to the next mission and the layout of the mini-map. In that regard, GTA veterans will feel right at home, though they will find little improvements to the formula in things like better checkpoint and mission replay systems.  This isn't just a redo of Grand Theft Auto with a different backdrop, however. Rockstar did a remarkable job of taking only the elements of its past games that work while adapting the flow and the controls to the Western setting. The Dead Eye slow motion effect makes you feel like a classic gunslinger. The confluence of a wide-open setting and turn of the century technology offer the perfect mix of civilization and wilderness. And the greater emphasis on ambient missions and random encounters makes the West feel as wild and untamed as your childhood daydreams imagined it. Red Dead Redemption handles well, too, outside of touchy horse controls that make the mounts seem a little too eager to jump over a fence or into a river. The target assist makes attacking enemies while riding a horse a breeze, but it also makes the combat a little too easy at times. The cover system works similarly to GTA IV, but there just didn't seem much need for it when I could simply walk ahead slowly ripping off shots with perfect accuracy. I died here or there, but rarely did Red Dead Redemption feel particularly challenging. Even after you've beaten Red Dead Redemption and completed 100% of the side challenges, there's still much more to do. The game continues online with cooperative and competitive modes for up to 16 players simultaneously. The competitive action includes team and free-for-all game types including standard shootouts and a capture the flag style of game. These are a decent distraction and can be quite fun -- especially at the start when each game begins with every player standing in a circle ready to draw pistols. Any hardcore player might end up a bit annoyed by the respawn system, however, which has a tendency to start you right next to an opponent. Without the other trimmings that I'll get to in a second, it isn't the kind of multiplayer experience I'd make a steady part of my gaming rotation.  Be as bad as you want to be.  The reason to keep coming back to Red Dead Redemption for months and months is called Free Roam. This is the multiplayer lobby of sorts, but the concept has been cranked up a notch to be an entire game in itself. Free Roam lets up to 16 players join into one world and then explore the entirety of the single-player map. You can form posses and take part in little skirmishes, simply shoot each other in the face, assault bandit hideouts and forts as a team, or just ride across the countryside together while taking part in hunting and gathering challenges. A large number of the side distractions from the single-player game are here, as well as a whole extra set of little objectives. By completing the missions, killing each other, or playing in competitive games, you can gain experience and begin leveling up to unlock new character models, modes, and better mounts to ride. Free Roam by itself is meaty enough to be an entirely separate game and it would still be awesome.  Sometimes you eat the bear...  Several special cooperative missions are being made for download as well, but they were not available at the time of this review and so they weren't considered. The first pack has been announced as free , though, so keep an eye out for it."

        "Content": "If there\u2019s one genre that lends itself to boom or bust, it's the online shooter. For every success like Call of Duty , Halo , or Apex Legends , it seems like there are at least a dozen other games that have come and gone with barely a spark before they fizzle. With so many good competitive shooters in play, what makes one stand out? After dozens of hours I\u2019m beginning to see how The Finals answers those questions: with an excellent gameshow-infused style and a brilliantly destructible playground. If the 1987 movie The Running Man  were about 3v3v3 gun battles, it would\u2019ve resembled The Finals. You and two teammates face off against other three-person squads in a virtual gameshow, vying to see who can be the first to score enough cash before time runs out. The vibrant color palette combines with a pair of live sports-style play-by-play announcers to give it that over-the-top, American Gladiators feel that people in the \u201880s thought was going to be the future of sports. That strikes a great balance of not taking itself too seriously without making it a total joke or becoming obnoxious. The Finals Review Screenshots 18 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There are currently two main modes: the first, Quick Cash, has each team vying to collect a vault of coins and deposit it at a designated  spot on the map, which tends to result in the bloody convergence of all three squads at those points. This really effectively keeps the action going, and because taking over the deposit doesn\u2019t reset its progress, rounds move at a steady pace and avoid momentum-killing stalemates altogether. Meanwhile the Bank It mode focuses a bit more on direct PvP battles, but they also tend to be more scattered. Here, each player carries coins in their virtual pockets, all of which is gathered either from vaults around the map or by eliminating enemies. The on-the-fly strategizing of going for kills one second and then needing to deposit your loot before it all goes to waste the next is exciting, and it\u2019s pretty fun to eliminate someone right in front of the bank so you can deposit all their coins yourself. Quick Cash really effectively keeps the action moving. \u201c Individually, both modes are well designed and generally very fun. The fact that The Finals is limited to just those two options, however, is a red flag. If the player base starts to grow tired of these game types and there aren\u2019t any other options, there is a real possibility of people moving on before too long. While I didn\u2019t find that to be an issue during my time playing, that does present a potential concern for the long-term health of this community that I hope is addressed with new modes in future updates. Once you\u2019ve played a few matches you\u2019ll unlock tournaments, and this is where the competitive attitude of The Finals really shines. The primary tournament mode puts you and seven other teams in a bracket playing modified versions of Cashout. Two games of four teams each run simultaneously, with the top two squads from each game advancing to the second round. The top two teams from that game then face off in a direct 3v3 match to determine the overall winner. It does a great job mixing the high stakes nature of an actual competition with rounds that are fast and satisfying enough to elicit that \u201cjust one more game\u201d feeling after each tournament. There\u2019s even a ranked version, where players can move up in leagues based on their performance. What's your favorite PvP shooter mode? Team deathmatch Capture the flag Team survival Free for all Search and destroy Domination Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results You can choose from three different weight classes for your character, and they all play very differently from each other. The Light build, for example, focuses on mobility, trading stopping power for a grappling hook to quickly get to high or far places. The Medium, meanwhile, is an all-arounder, and has abilities that focus on support, such as its healing beam. Finally, there\u2019s the Heavy, which could have been taken straight from Rainbow Six: Siege, as it alternates between controlling the battlefield with heavy weapons and smashing through walls like the Juggernaut. There\u2019s a solid variety of equipment for you to choose from before each match, and they can have a major impact on the battlefield if used properly. There are standard choices, like frag grenades and deployable cover, and those are tried and true options that do what you\u2019d expect \u2013 but they hardly stand out when you can instead drop jump pads that launch you high into the air, or goo grenades that can seal large spaces with an expanding foam. Some options are universal, like the pyro grenades, while others are restricted to specific classes, like the Medium builds\u2019 defibrillator that instantly revive downed teammates. Hopefully future updates can even the balance out. \u201c Those choices are undermined, however, as balance issues are a bit of a concern at the moment. Heavies tend to be ubiquitous in competitive modes, and their huge health pool and high damage output makes it easy to see why. Certain weapons like the flamethrower, grenade launcher, and sword seem to make up an outsized portion of the player arsenal I\u2019ve come across as well. Hopefully future updates can even things out, but as it is, a lightweight build with the semi-automatic battle rifle, for example, really struggles to compete with the rest of the meta, and that\u2019s a shame. Each character archetype also has a litany of cosmetics that can be unlocked through XP progression or by spending real world money. There\u2019s a pretty solid assortment to choose from right out of the gate, though the amount of time it takes to unlock good looking items (without taking out your wallet) is in need of major retuning. After 20 hours, the best I could afford was some fanny packs and tights on one character, which makes getting the whole squad glammed up feel like a pipe dream. That slow progression is also true of VRs, the in-game \u201ccash\u201d you earn for playing that\u2019s used to unlock non-cosmetic things like different abilities, weapons, and gadgets. I get that there needs to be a balance between giving you everything too soon, which can take away the joy of progression, and making it take too long to earn things, but right now The Finals skews a bit too much towards the latter. It\u2019s hard to experiment with builds when all the pieces for each character are locked behind dozens of hours of matches. Multibucks are the paid premium currency, and the cosmetic items that can only be purchased with them are the right mix of being unique enough to consider, but not necessary for folks who don\u2019t want to spend the money. They are the flashiest items by far, and include things like an Elvis-style jumpsuit in the paid battle pass, or gold skins for your weapons you can buy outright. Importantly, nothing restricted to Multibucks offers a competitive advantage, so there\u2019s no pay to win option \u2013 especially since VRs can only be earned through playing. None of the premium stuff is essential either, with the possible exception of the tin-foil hat wearing Conspirakitten that can ride your shoulder into battle. That\u2019s just too adorable to pass up. The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. \u201c The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. Sure, you can enter a room from the door or window. But taking the less obvious path of crashing right through the ceiling is a thrilling way to get the drop on unsuspecting teams, and you haven\u2019t really played The Finals until you\u2019ve stolen the vault by blowing a hole in an upper floor and had it drop right in front of you. By the end of a tense match, the battlefield is often littered with debris from entire buildings beginning to collapse. There\u2019s a lot more to that system than some cool rubble and an ad hoc door, too, as the strategic impact is huge. One map is high atop skyscrapers connected by sky bridges, and I sat in stunned silence the first time I saw a team destroy the section where a bridge met a building, causing the entire thing to collapse to the ground below. Split second judgment calls when buildings fall around you about whether to jump off or ride the debris down can make or break firefights and create unforgettable moments \u2013 like when my entire team was dead in the final seconds of a match, and the only thing that stopped another team from stealing the bank for the win was the amount of rubble they had to dig through to reach it.

There\u2019s nothing to be gained by ignoring objectives and going for straight kills, so teammates tend to do a good job being focused on the task, making solo play very viable. It does have one glaring weakness, however: in matches where I either didn\u2019t get grouped into a full three-person team, or someone left mid-fight, people were rarely pulled into our team to refill our ranks. It\u2019s very disheartening to be in a match by yourself, knowing you have no shot at winning and no reason to hold out hope that help is going to arrive. There will always be an element of luck in the quality of teammates you are matched with, which is a big part of why The Finals (as with most team-based shooters) is better across the board with people you know. It\u2019s so much fun to coordinate an assault with friends, or to seize the bank and then protect it with mines and defensive structures. It\u2019s also a huge advantage to work together. A flamethrower wielding Heavy supported by a healing beam from a Medium can wipe an entire team, and the strategic element of choosing complimentary builds and kits is very engaging. When someone dies, they leave an action figure behind that can be used to revive them, and scooping one up so you can find a safe place to bring them back is as useful as it is hilarious. (Crossplay and progression also made it quite nice to be able to bounce back and forth between different friends on my PC and Xbox Series X without missing a beat.)"

        "Content": "There\u2019s a limit to how much development can happen on a game in a single year, and MLB The Show 22 is the perfect example of what hitting that wall can look like. This year\u2019s entry into Sony San Diego\u2019s annualized baseball series plays as well as ever and looks great, but the confines imposed by its rigid release schedule are also more apparent than ever. A new cooperative mode is a welcome addition and an already solid stadium builder has been expanded upon nicely, but technical issues are more persistent than previous editions too. MLB The Show 22 is still a really good baseball game \u2013 it\u2019s just beginning to show signs that it may be time to call in a reliever. The lifelike recreation of Major League broadcasts in MLB The Show 22 is just as impressive as last year. There\u2019s a cinematic quality to the way player-controlled action is framed, with intros, outros, overlay graphics, and the deep pool of stats that baseball fans expect. The lovingly detailed recreations of real world ballparks look great in 4K too. The lighting is particularly stunning; real baseball games play out over multiple hours, and the in-game transition from sunset to a stadium fully illuminated against the night sky is marvelous. Suncast shadows in the afternoon give way to 360-degree illumination when the sun falls, and it\u2019s easy to forget what you see on screen is still just 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s on a hard drive. MLB The Show 22 Gameplay Screenshots 14 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask There is an all new broadcast crew bringing their voices to the series this year: Jon \"Boog\" Sciambi & Chris Singleton have replaced the Matt Vasgersian-lead team as the in-game announcers. The performances are generally convincing, and new voices are refreshing after many years of the same crew. However, the number of unique lines of dialogue is noticeably lower than before, and lines repeat with greater frequency than before. There are only so many times I could hear the same bad joke about how the ball is \u201cjust not carrying to first\u201d before I wanted to mute the announcers entirely. It also leads to some baffling holes in the dialogue, like when Ken Griffey Jr., who appears with spoken lines in the Road to the Show campaign, is only referred to as \u201cNumber 24\u201d when you play with him in games. The strength of MLB The Show is traditionally in its versatility, and that\u2019s no different here. Controls can be simple, with automatic baserunning, one button pitches, and easy hitting \u2013 or they can be complex, with multi-part thumbstick movements for pitching, and precision hitting. The former is easier to execute, but the latter will yield better results if done well, incentivising and rewarding you for trying to grow your skills without gating out those who want to have a more relaxed involvement. The strength of The Show is once again in its versatility. \u201c Likewise, Franchise Mode can be played in painstaking detail, with minor league call-ups, drafting, scouting, and micromanaging of budgets, or that can all be set to auto while you focus on playing in the games themselves. You\u2019re given multiple ways to right whatever historical wrongs have kept your favorite team from winning a championship and becoming a perennial powerhouse. It\u2019s a feat of design to be able to cater to users from the casual to the hardcore, yet MLB The Show continues to set the standard for accommodating diverse tastes. That said, while Major League Baseball is nearly 150 years old, The Show is still trailing behind this ancient sports institution in a few key areas. New rules extending the Designated Hitter throughout the entire league are going into effect as of the 2022 season, yet they aren\u2019t reflected here. This is especially disappointing as it relates to two-way players, including The Show 22\u2019s cover athlete Shohei Ohtani, who is a revelation as both an elite pitcher and hitter. In real-world baseball this rule change allows him to function as both a designated hitter and starting pitcher, enabling him to be relieved as a pitcher while remaining in the game as a batter. Sadly, MLB The Show lacks the capacity to make the same allowance. It\u2019s the sort of issue one would hope can be resolved in an update, but as of release is a swing and a miss. Double Play Online co-op is one of the key new editions in 2022, allowing you to form teams for 2v2 or 3v3 competition across platforms either with friends or through random matchmaking. Players on each team alternate batters while at the plate and rotate between pitching and fielding each inning, and being able to focus single-mindedly on one defensive task is liberating. While one person plays cat and mouse with pitch selection, the other can focus on where to go for force outs and make strategic choices around the diamond. There\u2019s joyous excitement to stepping up the plate with a friend on base, knowing they are depending on you to make the hit that brings them in for a key run. However, there are some limitations to co-op too. You can play in random games or in a limited Diamond Dynasty playlist, but there are no persistent teams or co-op leagues. You can\u2019t choose your opponents either, so the only way to play against friends is luck in matchmaking. Rotating defensive roles is also mandatory, forcing you to switch back and forth even if one player only wants to pitch while the other only wants to field. I played one game with a random teammate who was a really solid hitter and defender, but their struggles on the mound doomed us as our opponents drove in multiple runs every other inning. In its current iteration, co-op feels more like a fun proof-of-concept rather than a fully fleshed-out mode fit for online competition. The stability I\u2019ve come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit. \u201c Co-op games frequently failed to connect me with cross-platform friends when we tried to play together as well, and all sorts of technical issues were unfortunately common in my time with The Show 22. Players would sometimes walk to the dugout frozen in strange poses, tutorials that I had disabled in settings would still appear, I had to restart multiple times after freezes, and online matches of any sort were prone to random disconnects. The stability I\u2019ve generally come to expect from The Show has taken a noticeable hit, which is definitely a shame. Bases Loaded The Diamond Dynasty mode will be familiar to series veterans, allowing you to assemble teams made up of players from throughout baseball history, collected via randomized card packs, and face other player-assembled squads. The concept is well established in sports games, but the execution in The Show has been, and remains, excellent. Programs return as the battle pass stand-in: you accumulate XP by playing any of The Show\u2019s different modes, unlocking rewards as you progress up levels. Stubbs are your primary currency for purchasing packs, which you can once again buy with real money, but you also earn them at a reasonable rate regardless. I focused on completing daily challenges called \u201cMoments\u201d and was able to earn XP and Stubbs at a pace that didn't coerce me into spending cash. In no time I was able to relive the glory days of the 90\u2019s Seattle Mariners, with Ken Griffey Jr. patrolling the outfield while the golden mullet adorned Randy Johnson attacked batters with relentless fastballs. Microstransaction Reaction There are microtransactions in MLB The Show 22, just like in previous years. Paying money for Stubbs in order to unlock packs is a viable way to accelerate team building in Diamond Dynasty, but competitive teams can be built quickly through normal play as well. The cost of stubbs is fairly reasonable too: $5 will buy you 5000 stubbs, which is enough for three Show Packs that have five cards each. But even if you shell out for them, skill reigns supreme in online matches, so cash investments tend to be \u201cpay for an occasional, slight percentage advantage\u201d rather than true pay-to-win. The random nature of what can be found in card packs is also handled fairly well. You won\u2019t know what exactly you will get from a pack, but the odds of finding different kinds of cards are openly displayed, and there is enough variety of themed packs that you have a good idea what types of players you may unlock. It\u2019s still a roll of the dice, but to a more reasonable degree. A new mini-season mode is a very welcome single player focused activity for your Diamond Dynasty team, allowing you to pit them against seven CPU controlled teams in a 28-game season, complete with a miniature playoff at the end. Between this and the returning turn-based-strategy esque Conquest mode, it feels like we have reached a point where it\u2019s possible to have a rewarding Diamond Dynasty experience for players who prefer not to face the wild-west of random human opponents. On the other hand, the Road to the Show story mode is indistinguishable from previous versions, but it continues to be one of the best modes in any sports game anyway. Playing as a created prospect, following your player on their journey to the big leagues while you raise RPG-esque baseball stats, is addictive. Games often take just a few minutes, and it\u2019s hard to resist the urge to play just one more game, especially when you are seeing the ball well and making solid contact as a hitter. The few plays per game I spent on defense, framing pitches and gunning down base stealers as a catcher were great palette cleansers between at-bats, and the stat building mini games on off-days are rewarding. It still takes too long to transition from double-A to triple-A and on, but Road to the Show is so much more about the journey than the destination. Surprise! You were just called up to The Show. What position do you want to play? Pitcher Catcher Infield Outfield Designated Hitter Answer See Results The stadium builder has returned exclusively for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, unfortunately leaving The Show\u2019s Switch debut a slightly incomplete. The user interface has been tweaked, and building your dream ballpark is a smoother experience now that props can quickly be called up from a radial menu. Your custom-created stadium can now be played at day or night, and placing lights is surprisingly strategic. Prebuilt templates can expedite the process, and a great mix of serious and humorous pieces give you freedom to create both classic ballparks and absolute monstrosities. I built a ballpark with alien spaceships and a carefully illuminated (for safety) T-rex herd just because I could. It\u2019s a great example of a feature debuting one year, and improving in moderate but meaningful ways the next."

        "Content": "As a fan of the Dragon Ball Z anime from the \u201890s, I\u2019m attracted to fast action, destructible environments, and colorful beams of light that can blow up planets. Battle of Z has all of that and more, but even a Solar Flare to the face couldn\u2019t blind me to its simplistic fighting and useless AI teammates. Battle of Z\u2019s gorgeous environments and brilliantly modeled cel-shaded characters create the illusion of being a true Super Saiyan, but not much more.  Despite a deceptively tough learning curve, the combat is pretty bare-bones. Every one of the over 70 playable characters can use melee and ranged attacks and do some sort of powerful blast after charging up, all of which makes up 90 percent of the combat. As a result the fighting can feel shallow and repetitive after a while, which is a shame for a game solely based around world-destroying battles. I would have loved to see combo attacks or the ability to counter an opponent\u2019s barrage of punches, but these options simply don\u2019t exist.  After beating certain missions I was awarded cards I could attach to my characters to boost their stats, a nice gimmick that gave me the edge I needed in tough skirmishes. However, because cards can be given to or taken from fighters with no penalty, the mechanic is largely pointless as it was no-brainer to throw as many on myself and my teammates as I could. Even with the option to auto-assign cards to characters, it was tedious to need to constantly switch cards back and forth depending on the fighter and teammates I chose for a particular mission.  The remaining 10 percent of combat involves two moves unique to each character depending on their class, and experimenting with different characters to find ones that suited is one of the best rewards of Battle of Z. For instance, Goku, a melee-focused fighter, has a couple of powerful punches only he can pull off while Gotenks, a Ki blast type, can unleash a barrage of energy missiles. One of my favorite fighters, Kid Buu, can close the gap with either a quick teleport or by stretching his arm several feet to pull opponents in for a melee attack, making him hard to predict. Just as important are support types like Android 18 who can heal allies, though I could hardly depend on AI medics when I went down. More often than not the bots ignored me and continued fighting, leaving me to die a lonely death and wasting a valuable life in our limited pool of retries. That resulted in some pretty infuriating game over screens.  After beat the roughly 12 hours\u2019 worth of offline single-player missions I was pretty tired of failing due to the incompetence of my computer allies, so I turned to the online co-op only to find the unreliable and tedious matchmaking and jumped online to tackle some stages with real partners. I found it immensely satisfying to coordinate attacks three allies and proceed to pulverize a foe around the stage in chaotic four vs. four matches, and surviving some of the more brutal challenges with my mates inspired a cry of victory (don\u2019t even ask me how many times we lost the showdown with Perfect Cell). Unfortunately, lag is a consistent issue, and the matchmaking\u2019s tendency to throw players of every skill level together means most games included brand-new players who can be an even bigger burden than the bots.  One of the best parts about co-op mode, though, is that it eliminates the restrictions on character selection present in single-player, leading to some unique (and canon-breaking) battles. Have you ever wanted to play as Captain Ginyu and team up with Kid Trunks and two Vegetas to take down Raditz and Nappa? Now you can. Even better are the hypothetical missions Battle of Z throws your way after beating the main sagas, such as a reunion battle between all of Frieza\u2019s and his brother Cooler\u2019s terrifying forms. I only wish these fiction-shattering team-ups and showdowns were fully available in single-player.  On the other hand, the most disappointing aspect of Battle of Z is its poorly balanced competitive multiplayer. There are only four game modes available, three of them kill-\u2018em-all affairs, and the fourth basically a capture-the-flag mode with Dragon Balls. Sadly, most of the matches are brutal and one-sided. In Normal Battle (read: Team Deathmatch), teams share a pool of lives that depends on the absolute strength of the fighters each player chooses\u2014the stronger each warrior, the fewer lives that team gets. Perhaps developer Artdink thought this would even things out a bit. The truth is I never played one fight where the side with the more powerful characters didn\u2019t win by a landslide. Matches lasted mere seconds, not minutes, and rarely did the winning team lose even one life. No matter what side you\u2019re on, that result isn\u2019t fun, and the five to ten minutes it takes up just to set up a match on top of the already tremendous lag just makes the frustration that much worse. If you can\u2019t resist taking the fight to others, I recommend playing Score Battle, which places characters\u2019 power levels into tiers and makes matches a much more balanced affair. Still, multiplayer should be avoided until you\u2019ve unlocked some of the more elite warriors in single-player or co-op, or you\u2019re likely to be obliterated faster than you can say \u201cKamehameha.\u201d"

        "Content": "Stepping off the boat in Seyda Neen at the beginning of The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind brought back a flood of memories from 2002\u2019s The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Seeing the plain wooden dock extend out in front of me toward the small hamlet made me feel as though I were 15 years younger, ready to tackle the world laid out in front of me. In every pixel, The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind strives to create this feeling. And the centerpiece island of Vvardenfell, coupled with a new interesting class and stellar writing, make this a great new expansion. If there is a downside, it\u2019s the fact that Vvardenfell is so faithfully recreated here that it diminishes the sense of discovery and wonder for series veterans. I pretty much knew where everything is located, and that costs it some of the luster that ESO brought when it first launched. That said, while you can find familiar locations, the ESO: Morrowind takes place 700 years before the events of the single-player game, and that allows for some differences that make it worthy of exploration. The Red Mountain volcano dominating the heart of Vvardenfell lies dormant during this time, leaving greener landscapes around its northern slopers. The labyrinthine ziggurat city of the demigod Vivec is still under construction, and the Warrior-Poet himself is more inclined to receive visitors than Morrowind players will remember. The giant mushrooms that pepper your view serve as a reminder than this is a wilder and more exotic place than the comparatively cookie-cutter fantasy settings found on much of the Tamriel mainland. The writing in the main storyline of Morrowind instills a sense of urgency. \u201c Morrowind\u2019s player-versus-environment content took about 25 hours to move through, aside from the challenging new raid. That's on the shorter side for an MMORPG expansion, but it makes up for the slim quantity with the quality of its storytelling and writing. I found myself getting lost in the fiction while helping House Redoran find a long-lost daughter and solving the mystery of her disappearance. Coming upon slave workers near House Telvanni, I made it my mission to help free these helpless souls from their oppression. It\u2019s so well done I actually cared about the people in the stories themselves - a feeling many MMORPGs don\u2019t create with me. The writing in the main storyline of Morrowind instills a sense of urgency, which made me feel as though every decision I made carried real weight in the world. And some of the plot twists within the quest themselves, as well as some gut-wrenching decisions at the end of a few quest lines stand out in my mind, still make me question whether I made the right choice days later. The gameplay formula for those adventures is the same in Morrowind as it has always been in MMORPGs of this style: long quest chains leading you from one place to another, with optional stops for sidequests along the way. However, thanks to the One Tamriel update, which removed level requirements from content and allows everyone to quest and explore as they wish, you are no longer limited in what you can do based on you level as you were during ESO's bumpy first year. As a result, One Tamriel really helps to make Morrowind incredibly accessible for both veterans and new players alike. You can start anew with a character in Morrowind thanks to an excellent new player tutorial, and existing players can travel to Vvardenfell (the wayshrine is already available to returning players) and continue their journey. This helps set Morrowind apart from other expansions in the genre. You aren\u2019t forced to level through all the previous content before starting the expansion \u2013 you can simply pick up and go. The Warden actually encourages you to use a mix of its three distinct skill lines. \u201c Another major addition that Morrowind brings is the uniquely versatile Warden, the first new class in ESO since its 2014 launch. It\u2019s a jack of all trades \u2013 the Warden actually encourages you to use a mix of its three distinct skill lines: Animal Companion for summoning; Green Balance for healing and buffs; and the defensive bolstering skills of Winter's Embrace. It\u2019s the first time in ESO that I\u2019ve ever felt it was a good idea to have a mix of all three skill lines on both of my skill bars. Animal Companion brings me much needed damage dealing, while Green Balance and Winter\u2019s Embrace help to keep me alive in long fights. Whether I\u2019ve been soloing or running delves in groups, I\u2019ve never felt as though my Warden has been holding me back \u2013 something I can\u2019t say during the early days of leveling my Templar and Sorcerer at launch. The drawback, though, is that the centerpiece skill \u2013 the bear companion \u2013 is a big disappointment. As pet classes go, The Elder Scrolls Online has always fallen short of its peers, and the Warden is no different. In fact, the bear companion is simply the Sorcerer class' Storm Atronach in another skin and comes with all of the same issues. As you have virtually no control over your pet beyond it attacking whatever enemy you hit with a heavy attack, it kind of does its own thing. And while it does help keep some enemies busy during group fights, the lack of direct control for a skill that occupies a precious ultimate skill slot on an ability feels like a handicap. The Warden's versatility can supplements group with whatever it needs. \u201c It\u2019s actually to its credit that the Warden isn\u2019t likely to become the end-all be-all class for any of ESO's traditional playstyles. Templars and Restoration Staff specialists can still claim the stop spot for healing, and many dungeon and trial groups still consider the Dragonknight class the go-to tank. But the Warden makes for a nice jack-of-all-trades class as its versatility can supplements group with whatever it needs: An off-tank, an area-of-effect healer, or someone who can simply provide just that little extra damage per second to bring a group over the top. It\u2019s balanced so that it won\u2019t supplant the existing order, just augment it. That versatility makes Wardens feel like the perfect class to pick if you\u2019re planning to solo the expansion. But playing solo brings up one of Morrowind\u2019s central disconnects between its gameplay and its otherwise strong storytelling: the desire to live up to its Elder Scrolls single-player heritage in a multiplayer setting. ESO has struggled with this duality, and it feels further exacerbated within the confines of Vvardenfell. One of the long quest chains in Suran, in which you\u2019re asked to find out who is at the center of an illegal slaving ring, serves as an example. It\u2019s a quest that continually makes the point that you \u2013 and no one else \u2013 are the hero. Yet every time you zoom out of the conversation with the quest givers, you\u2019re presented with the image of crowds of other people, all identically costumed (as one part of the story requires you to dress up), all huddled around the same character being told the same story. It\u2019s a feeling that came up more than once, especially in the main questline, as I worked through the PvE content. In a game that has always been more single-player or small-group focused like ESO, it\u2019s not a huge issue. But it does sour the experience some. The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind Screens 5 Images This isn\u2019t to say that Morrowind doesn\u2019t offer plenty of multiplayer-focused experiences. The expansion brings with it an exciting new player-versus-player arena mode called Battlegrounds, which pits three teams of four against each other in deathmatch, capture the flag, and domination. The mode feels fresh \u2013 it\u2019s a definite change of pace from the large, hectic and sometimes unfocused battlegrounds in Cyrodiil. Success is based on what your opponent is wearing. \u201c Unfortunately, Battlegrounds matches suffer from major balancing issues when setting up teams. While Champion Points (which bolster your abilities further after reaching the level cap,) are disabled during this mode, armor and weapon set bonuses (such as the Sanctuary set which adds to your maximum health and increases the healing you receive) are still in full effect. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it feels as though the Battlegrounds mode is based more on what your opponent is wearing rather than how well they can play their character. Additionally, it\u2019s frustrating to see lower-level players pitted against the many players who've reached the cap of 630 Champion Points \u2013 there is an obvious difference in the player skill there that should be taken into account during matchmaking. In one match, five different players (myself, as a Warden, and four others, including one from an enemy team) were all attacking a high-level Champion player at once and couldn\u2019t even dent his health bar. Contrast this with the fact my character dies almost on command, and it makes for an incredibly frustrating multiplayer match. However, when matchmaking manages to place you in a competitive group, the Battlegrounds can be plenty of fun. It\u2019s a lot more focused than Cyrodiil, and the multiple game modes keep the matches from becoming stale. It would be nice if you were able to stay in a Battleground queue in between matches instead of loading back into the main game and then having to requeue. But it\u2019s a start."

        "Content": "The Himalayan country of Kyrat is a place of myth, faith, secrets, lies, and beauty, and it's one of the best-realized locations I've ever explored in a video game. Kyrat is a colossal, dense, visually diverse place that feels lived in, torn up, and ancient. Far Cry 4 capitalizes on every available strength to make it an amazing open world for first-person action and adventure, while failing repeatedly in creating enjoyable characters within it. Its most notable misfire is the hollow, ambivalent protagonist. Ajay Ghale, the American son of Kyrati freedom fighters, returns to his Himalayan birthplace to scatter his mother\u2019s ashes, and becomes embroiled in his parents\u2019 revolution. It\u2019s a smart, human premise that justifies Ajay\u2019s rampant warpath throughout Kyrat, but Ajay isn\u2019t remotely as interesting as the things he does. Versatility is the greatest strength in Far Cry 4\u2019s first-person exploration and combat. I scaled cliffs with climbing gear in search of treasure, religious monuments, and hostages in need of rescue. In venturing into the Himalayan mountains, I stole oxygen masks and snowmobiles to survive, and used the unstable environment to crush enemies with snow. Long-lost letters told a tragic story I wanted to learn more about. Collectible calling cards had me on the trail of a serial killer, and gorgeous vistas had me in awe of Kyrat\u2019s lakes, mountains, and other spectacular scenery. This is sometimes compromised by lower-resolution textures and an inferior draw distance on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but Far Cry 4 is comparable to Far Cry 3 in terms of visual fidelity, and up to expectations for old-generation hardware. I loved discovering every inch of Kyrat because it always presented compelling opportunities. Liberating it from the oppressive government was always front and center; as in Far Cry 3, enemy-occupied towers serve as platforming puzzles with a fulfilling sense of personal progression. Climbing to the top gives you a broader perspective of the world, highlighting notable places and unlocking new objectives. Liberating outposts is more challenging in Far Cry 4 than in its predecessor, and more satisfying as a result. Take the stealthy approach and you can disable alarms individually to prevent enemy reinforcements, and use bait to attract tigers, bears, and other animals to occupy the enemy\u2019s attention. The hard counter to this is the Hunter, a new, silent enemy wielding a bow and capable of charming animals into fighting for him. He creates another unexpected variable that made me think even harder about how these excellent combat systems worked together. Plus, enemy forces sometimes attempt to reclaim their territory, challenging you to drop what you're doing and fend off waves of ruthless soldiers. This also  encourages you to take down specific strongholds that, when vanquished, cease the takeovers. Wrestling with the Royal Army like this puts an even stronger emphasis on outposts, one of the franchise's most alluring attractions. These encounters emphasize the importance of improvisation in Far Cry 4. The unpredictability of a situation getting out of hand often leads to catastrophic, unforgettable moments \u2014 like the time I blew up a bear with C4 to protect the hired guns I'd called in to help take an outpost. Once, I shot grenades from my personal helicopter and watched the fire trap the enemies below. Another time, I mounted an elephant, smashed through a gate, and flipped a pickup truck into a man. Tossing enemies with my elephant\u2019s one-hit-kill trunk is basically everything I dreamed it would be. Outpost battles \u2014 particularly the four larger fortresses owned by government officers \u2014 are at their best when a friend drops in for some two-player co-op. Adding another player to the volatility of Far Cry combat leads to new kinds of hectic, hilarious moments. Cooperative multiplayer also introduces new tactical opportunities, like having one player blow through the front door while another sneaks in through the back to stab distracted guards. You can, if you're patient and skilled, use Far Cry 4's Map Editor to create your own single-player outpost missions. At launch, most of the best missions are familiar takeover objectives, with a nice variety of snowy settings, evening assaults, and intricate, larger level designs. I don't see myself making much, but I'll absolutely jump into a community map between co-op outpost runs. Far Cry 4\u2019s competitive multiplayer does a marvelous job of capturing the freedom, scale, and surprises of its co-op and campaign. The 5v5 competitive multiplayer, called Far Cry Chronicles, sees two asymmetrical factions fighting in different ways, using the wide-open environments to their particular advantages. The Golden Path plays more like an aggressive Far Cry player tends to -- guns, explosives, vehicles, and traps. The Rakshasa, who borrow supernatural powers seen in Shangri-La, relying on invisibility, and different types of arrows for their bow. I adore the Rakshasa style -- teleporting with the Blink Arrow, whether for navigation, escape, or an instant kill, is a great tool. Summoning a tiger or bear to guard an area works beautifully. Chronicles also has a strong economy, with in-game successes earning coins to spend on new weapons, attachments, or skills, such as stronger stealth, faster movement, or a closer connection to wildlife summons. The maps aren\u2019t terribly notable in Chronicles, and the modes are simple, unremarkable, but functional, but borders on miraculous that the heart and soul of Far Cry 4 found its way into a competitive mode at all. It\u2019s a bummer that matches start whether or not teams are even, and that not a lot of people are actually playing it, because this is actually great. Don't skip multiplayer because it isn't why you play a Far Cry game. The supernatural side-story set in Shangri-La stands out above nearly every other objective, online feature, and other Far Cry 4 success, though. Like a miniature Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon doled out in chunks throughout Far Cry 4, the psychedelic, stunning aesthetic of its crimson foliage and golden skies is completely unlike Kyrat, as is the foundation of its combat. It\u2019s linear, by design, but introduces enough new and interesting ideas to have an identity of its own. Teaming up with a fierce tiger, slowing time, and firing five arrows at a time to take down fearsome demons is a huge change of pace. The myth is explained episodically, and while I didn\u2019t fully understand the legend, I couldn\u2019t seek out the next piece of Shangri-La\u2019s weird, wonderful world fast enough. All of these missions feed into Far Cry 4\u2019s brilliant economy, where everything in Kyrat has a cause and effect. Hunting and skinning animals lets you craft holsters to hold more weapons, or wallets to carry more money. Reclaiming enemy territory creates fast-travel points and opens side-quests promising huge cash payouts. Destroying propaganda posters unlocks new missions as well as earns experience points. XP unlocks new skills, like aerial takedowns, damage resistance, and riding elephants, which is both hysterical and actually useful. It also presents opportunities to become a better hunter \u2014 unlockable injections show off animal and enemy locations, or double the damage you deal and take. Far Cry 4 borrows heavily from Far Cry 3\u2019s superb player progression (many of the skills are direct carryovers), and then layers new rewards on top of it. New Karma Events unlock gear, discounts, and XP for spinning spiritual prayer wheels, or killing specific enemies in randomly occurring objectives. Half the campaign\u2019s main missions are strong, memorable, and take advantage of Far Cry 4\u2019s flexible combat. These quests typically explore Ajay Ghale\u2019s fascinating family history, or the ethically gray future of the Ghale\u2019s faction, The Golden Path, and the dark places your choices can take it. The Golden Path\u2019s bickering leaders, Amita and Sabal, are the emotional anchor for this part of the story. They\u2019re unified in their goal to dethrone the despicable king of Kyrat, Pagan Min, but their conflicting personal philosophies cause volatile problems for the country. I was often conflicted about who to side with during single-player missions \u2013 both make strong ethical arguments for why you should, say, claim an enemy opium farm to fund your revolution, or destroy it to free Kyrat from narcotics. Where the Golden Path goes, and which missions become available, differ depending on who you choose to lead the revolution. When Amita and Sabal aren\u2019t involved, Far Cry 4\u2019s cast of mostly poor characters compromises its campaign. The weaker half of the story relates to Pagan Min and his lieutenants. I barely remember what the missions were, or what completing them accomplished. Pagan Min is a great character, thanks to an excellent, gleefully sadistic and twisted performance from actor Troy Baker. But Min is completely misused. He has a thunderous introduction, followed by a disappointing, minimal presence throughout Far Cry 4\u2019s 15-hour campaign. Worse, his poorly explained henchmen don\u2019t have time to become interesting before vanishing from the story in sudden and confusing ways. When I\u2019d finished with a story I simultaneously loved and loathed, I keep returning to my meandering around Kyrat. I uncovered new temples. I found more of Ajay\u2019s father\u2019s journals, chronicling the struggles of The Golden Path\u2019s rise. I wondered whether I\u2019d made the right choices for Kyrat -- a country I didn\u2019t want to leave, and a place I\u2019ll continue fighting for as long as it keeps giving me reasons to."

        "Content": "Magicka: Wizard Wars seems like it should be better than it is. On paper it's a sure-fire winner: take Magicka, with its comical little wizards and huge number of elemental spell combos and counterspells, add team-based multiplayer, and make it free-to-play in a fair and appealing way. So why is the reality so frequently lackluster? It remains a fun game, because there\u2019s something inherently enjoyable about that skill-based Magicka formula, but Wizard Wars shows how a poorly thought-out MOBA-inspired design can suck the magic out of a game. Developer Paradox North hasn\u2019t done Wizard Wars any favors in saddling it with a surprisingly crude and unstable client. Wizard Wars may bring back some unwelcome memories of Magicka 1\u2019s famously rocky co-op: half my attempts to join a session have ended in crashes or matchmaking failures. I've sat in a game lobby for several minutes, watching fellow players flicker in and out, resetting the countdown timer each time they reconnect. When a game ends, you get a fleeting glance at the score screen before \"CONNECTION LOST\" pops-up and you're dumped back to the main menu. Or the desktop, depending on how Wizard Wars is feeling that day. It's not game-killingly bad. Most of the time I'm able to find a match within a few minutes of sitting down (give or take a few restarts), and once I'm in, I'll almost certainly get to play it through to the end. But there are also times when either matchmaking is broken or there is practically nobody online playing \u2013 even in the week following the official launch. Either seems plausible, but it means that Wizard Wars is a game that I always approach with the mindset of \"I'll try to play,\" rather than \"I'm going to play.\" Once you get into a match, things are much more stable. The trouble is that even when Wizard Wars is on its best technical behavior, you're playing a MOBA version of Magicka where the MOBA and the Magicka aspects don't complement each other so much as just exist alongside each other. Of Wizard Wars' three game modes, Wizard Warfare is the clear winner. It's a control-point-based spawn-ticket game where the first team to run out of respawns, or to be locked out of all the spawn points, loses the game. It's fast-paced, dynamic, and progresses to a swift endgame. There are several different maps, each one has slightly different dynamics that allow for sneak attacks and rush strategies. The one-on-one Wizard Duel probably gives you purest magical competition. There's a couple teleporters to allow players to maneuver, but it really comes down to casting spells and blocks more effectively that your opponent. On the other hand, the distance is so compressed that it starts to feel a little random. Whoever gets a little behind on hit points is easy prey for spammed melee attacks, and wizard melees always felt a little anticlimactic to me.

You can queue up to three spells, combining different effects to make new spells, and then choosing how you want to cast them. It's all as enjoyable as ever, though a bit overwhelming at the start. With time, however, I took great satisfaction in casting protective wards on my character based on what spells other players were favoring (giving myself wards against Death and Fire magic, for instance, when I saw players making use of fiery beams of Death magic). Knowing what spells will be effective against which defenses, and how to deploy shields and traps of your own to defend yourself, gives Wizard Wars a bit of the feeling of a fighting game. That works well in Wizard War and the Duels, but the MOBA-style Soul Harvest game mode ends up being a misfire because it shoehorns Magicka gameplay into a drawn-out format that doesn\u2019t suit it. Since Magicka wizards don't level up or get more powerful as the game goes on, there is nothing to create an endgame. The two teams merely cycle around creep camps, slaughtering the same groups of mindless monsters, until they bring down each other's defenses and can destroy the other team's effigy. Fighting other players is almost a waste of time, especially since the respawn timers never change. In fact, if you win a big teamfight near the end of a game, it becomes harder to finish them off because your opponents instantly respawn at their base, which means they'll be waiting for you when you get there. When you have a MOBA where you're telling your team not to fight other players because winning will cost you the game, something has gone awry. The odds of having a fair game are also pretty small, unfortunately. Whether it's because of the server instability issues that I experienced in the client, or because Wizard Wars does nothing to discourage people from abandoning games or being abusive (there's no \"report player\" option), most games I've played have seen the 4v4 erode into a 4v3, or even a 4v2 or 3v2. That's a hard blow in a Soul Harvest game, which depends entirely on team's abilities to spread out across the map to farm for souls. It's stuff like this that really hurts Wizard Wars as a competitive game. Not being able to report players is infuriating in a MOBA that allows friendly fire. One of my first games had a player on my team running around killing everyone in his path, whether a friendly or not, and it cost us the game after 30 or 40 minutes of misery. The griefer was the second-highest scoring player. Any online competitive game needs a way to deal with people like that. Wizard Wars doesn't have one. Since Magicka doesn't really have distinct characters (everyone is a faceless robed figure with access to the same set of spells) it's metagame elements take the place of traditional MOBA class and character distinctions. You can buy (with real money or in-game gold) items and equipment that provide special bonuses and penalties. You also gain experience and unlock masteries, which give you access to special equipment and special, limited-use powers (think \"ultimates\" in other MOBAs). So it's important to play to your strengths: I favor Death magic, so my special robe, staff, and underpants (hey, this is Magicka) all give me Death magic bonuses, but at the expense of penalties to Fire. So Fire has basically vanished from my repertoire while Death is a part of almost every spell combo I use. However, it's harder to approach other players the same way. You can see their bonuses before a match starts but, once you're in-game, who is going to remember that the green wizard with the chainmail has a healing bonus and extra HP while the guy in the ninja robes has\u2026 wait, I forgot what the ninja robe does. See what I mean? Finally, there is the store where you can buy things with real money or currency earned during battle. As you play, you get treasure chests that have to be unlocked with keys (similar to Dota 2\u2019s system). You don't know what's in the chest, but you do know how rare it is, so there's always a temptation to go get some keys when you're sitting on particularly rare loot. You can also just buy some equipment outright. Yet I never felt like I was getting the hard sell. Wizard Wars isn't a poorer experience with basic gear, and fundamentally it's the same game no matter what you're using in battle. Which is, of course, Wizard Wars' biggest problem. As I said at the start, there is something fundamentally enjoyable about Magicka, and the same is true of Wizard Wars. Magicka has always been a lighter, sillier kind of game about semi-competent wizards running around blowing themselves and others to pieces. However, Wizard Wars' conservative approach to adapting Magicka to the MOBA template makes for a game that's long on repetition and short on tactical depth."

        "Content": "More than any other game to date, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune seems to define the PlayStation 3. Naughty Dog's 2007 jungle romp starring the one and only Nathan Drake gave gamers a taste of what it would be like to play as an acrobatically-inclined Indiana Jones. With stunning visuals (that still rank amongst the best in gaming today), a fantastically told story, great puzzles and high-octane gunplay, it's easily one of the best titles of this console generation. Now Naughty Dog returns to the spotlight with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves . Both expectedly and amazingly, Naughty Dog has indeed bested Nate's first adventure and has created a sequel that is not only bigger and better in practically every way, but also packs a multiplayer component that could be released as its own separate, full-priced game and people would stand in line to hand over their cash. Yes, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is fantastic. Trying to remain as spoiler-free as possible, I'll just say that the story starts off about a year or so after the events of the first game and begins with Nate and a few fellow thieves working on finding Marco Polo's lost treasure fleet. Of course, things aren't quite that simple and the cast winds up going on a much grander adventure, one that takes them half-way around the world. That's about as far as I want to go with the storyline, though some of the trailers out there actually reveal a little more than that. The important part here though is that this game doesn't just take place on a single island and instead changes locales a handful of times over the course of the adventure. The result is that the pacing feels better and faster, and even though you're technically doing the same sort of shooting, climbing and puzzle solving throughout the game, the different ways the scenes are presented gives Among Thieves a greater sense of gameplay variety than the original. The great storytelling extends to the character development, which has been turned up a good notch or two. Almost everyone with more than two lines of dialogue has an interesting reason for doing what they're doing (though the main bad guy is just bad), and the way that everyone interacts with one another is realistic and interesting. Almost every character is unpredictable in some way, but not in a forced or unnatural manner. The story itself twists and turns throughout the course of the game, as you might expect, and for the most part it's a solid tale. Nate and his pals go through a lot, so it does a good job of reeling you in and keeping you hooked until the end. While I'd say the story is quite good overall, I wouldn't say that it's perfect. Without giving anything away, while most of the story has solid footing in real-world lore and legend, it does start to veer away from this at some point in a way that could have been handled better. Still, it's told very, very well through the use of fantastic cutscenes and acting, and will keep you guessing at what'll happen until the very end. As for the gameplay itself, Uncharted 2 -- like the original Drake's Fortune -- tasks you with gunfights, environmental navigation or puzzle solving. While a lot of the mechanics are identical to the first title, everything has been blended together a little better, especially the combat and navigation. This is in large part due to the settings that you'll fight in. Whereas the first game generally had you walk into an area with lots of cover, set up behind a wall and then take guys out as best you could, Uncharted 2 offers a lot more variety and options in how these sequences play out thanks to the fantastic level design. Rather than fighting on flat ground, almost every battle scene features multiple levels and areas to use to your advantage. If you want to stay on the ground and take guys out the old fashioned way, you're more than welcome to. But you can also climb to higher ground and use height to your advantage, or flank the enemy by moving from cover to cover and changing your tactics as the battle unfolds around you. While the game is still very much a linear tale, taking you from point to specific point, you're offered many more options in how you approach and deal with battles. One thing that plays a big part in this is that stealth is a much more prominent element of the game, and it's actually a very useful tactic to take advantage of when you approach a situation. If an enemy doesn't see you and you attack him, you'll perform a silent stealth takedown. While you could do similar things in the original game, the way that it's implemented and the way sections are set up allow you to actually use it well. There are a couple spots in the game where I took down four or five enemies before the gunfire starting whizzing around, greatly improving my chances of survival. It's even possible to avoid a big fight entirely if you can clear an area of enemies silently as there won't be anyone around to call in for reinforcements. Of course, you don't have to use any stealth at all if you just want to start popping caps when you roll into a fight. Well, that is except for a sequence near the start of the game where you have to be stealthy as you're not allowed to be seen or outright kill anyone. The problem here is that your route isn't as obvious as it could be and you only need to, and perhaps are even realistically able to, take down three or four guys out of a room packed to the gills with guards. If you don't do things in a fairly specific order, you'll fail and have to restart. The most problematic bit here is that two enemies that you can take down are in tricky spots. One that you have to take down hangs out near a banister that's only a little higher than you stand. You can't just grab him because he's too high up, and half the time that I'd jump up to grab the ledge I would wind up startling him. If you know exactly what you're doing here then you could get through this sequence in about a minute or so, but due to its trial-and-error nature, I was probably stuck here for a good 15 or 20 minutes before moving on. But fortunately, everything after this is smooth sailing. In fact, this is one of those rare games that keeps getting better and better as it goes on. The first half felt like a nice -- if somewhat subtle -- improvement in the gameplay department over the original, but once you hit the half-way point, everything kicks into full swing and you start getting into jaw-dropping sequences. However, one complaint that we had with the first game is still present here: you'll get to rooms of enemies where soldiers just keep on coming, wave after wave. Now, from a design and technical standpoint this solution makes sense because if you started in a room with 30 guys already present, you'd never have an opening to fire back as you would just be pelted with constant gunfire. But, it's still a little aggravating to get into a fight, clear the room and then have a half-dozen more guys walk in and start shooting up the place. Perhaps if the battles weren't as concentrated in single rooms and you would have to continue to fight as you moved down hallways this would feel a little more realistic, but it is what it is. So, aside from that, the combat is improved and nicely makes use of your climbing abilities. Similarly, though the mechanics are essentially unchanged, the bits of the game where you have to scale the environment are taken up a level as well. The sequences where you're solely focused on navigating the world are usually visually stunning, and some even incorporate moving bits that make you think about where you're going. It's hard to explain why it's better than the original title without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that during a number of these segments, even though I'd be doing essentially the same stuff that I did in the last game, I found myself in awe of what and where I was climbing. Great stuff. My only real complaint, which is a forced one that I'm just mentioning to put it out there, is that the climbing paths are still very linear, and from what I was able to tell, there's only one way through most every section. If you're somewhere and there isn't a door, you know that you need to look around for something that you can grab to begin climbing. It's sort of a, \"well, I don't know where this'll take me, but it's the only thing I can do\" sort of scenario. Again, this isn't really a complaint that I'm knocking the game for, but in the future it would be nice to either have multiple ways to get somewhere, or a more sensible reason for climbing up bricks that I can just happen to scale. The third piece of the Uncharted puzzle is, well, puzzles. The first title blended action, climbing and puzzle solving in great fashion, and though it's handled differently this time around, Naughty Dog has solved the equation perfectly again. Whereas it seems to me like there are less puzzles this time, the ones that you do come across are complicated and very involved. Instead of peppering small interactive quizzes throughout the game, you'll come to roomfuls of things to solve, many of which are multi-staged puzzles. What's cool is that instead of having Sir Francis Drake's journal, Nate keeps his own this time around that you can freely flip through. And you'll need to, as some puzzles require multiple pages of clues. One in particular referenced a good four or five pages of the book, so you need to look at what's going on, flip through the book, do some stuff and then go back to the book again. It doesn't feel forced, and due to the intricacies therein, I felt more accomplished when I passed them. Great stuff here. One thing that I didn't touch on when I was talking about combat was the AI. Those of you who played the original (and if you haven't, head to the store ASAP) know that Nate was up against some very smart foes. They'd take cover, use grenades well and were generally fun to fight because of this. For better or worse, things are about the same this time around. Honestly, I didn't really expect an obvious improvement because they were already so good, so that's actually praise rather than a complaint. I will say though that the AI continues to make great use of the environment even though it's generally way more complicated this time around, which is great. Now, while the opponent AI was already impressive, your companion AI is absolutely phenomenal. You're almost always with someone else this time around, which was something that I was a little concerned about when I had originally heard this as friendly AI almost always gets in the way. Not here, and not ever. It really feels like they're with you rather than in your way, thinking for themselves and doing stuff that real people would do. If there are climbing sequences, the computer will either quickly go ahead or stay back and wait for you to pass it first. If there's a gunfight, it'll find its own cover, take care of itself and stay out of your way. The only time in the game that I thought the AI did something that I wasn't pleased with was once when I came to a room where two factions where fighting, we were hidden in cover and I wanted to wait the battle out. After staying quiet for about 30 seconds and playing along, Chloe popped up and joined the battle, dragging me into it as well. That's it. During the other ten hours of the adventure, of which a good eight-plus is spent with someone at your side, they were always complementary rather than hurtful and often actually very helpful. It's impossible to talk about Uncharted 2 without mentioning its visuals. I've already touched on the fantastic presentation in the cutscenes, but there are some scenes that you'll play in that will have your jaw on the floor. The world is packed with bits of detail that do nothing for gameplay, but do a lot to draw you into the world and make you feel like this is a real place. The texture detail is astounding, the amount of random stuff everywhere is mind boggling, the lighting is some of the best we've ever seen and the overall art direction is phenomenal. And of course, let me not forget to mention the amazing animation, killer explosions and pretty much every other pixel on the screen. It's kind of amazing to say this, but the actual gameplay oftentimes looks better than the cutscenes. This is truly one of the best looking games that I've ever seen, and you could easily argue that it's the best overall on the PlayStation 3 (when you can argue that against the likes of Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4, well, that's saying something). So that's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves in a large nutshell. Or is it? Yes indeed, this time around Naughty Dog went out of its way to include an online component, one that features both versus and cooperative gameplay. To say that the multiplayer is fun would be a massive understatement. For my money, this is one of the best multiplayer experiences that you'll find in any game around, and considering that the single-player portion alone is enough to easily warrant your $60, well, this almost feels like Naughty Dog has given us an extra game for free. The list of options and features here is immense. For competitive play you get a good variety of modes including stuff like team deathmatch, elimination, capture the flag (or treasure in this case), a zone control mode and more. You can gain ranks, which then in turn allows you to buy perks (like the ability to hold more ammo or reload faster) with money that you earn while playing. Levels here are scenes adapted from the single-player game, so you're getting the same fantastic design elements with lots of spots to take advantage of, places to hide and use for cover, and so on and so forth. .For the cooperative stuff, you have a handful of options here. A survival mode is exactly what it sounds like - you and a couple friends hole up in a spot and take out wave after wave of enemies that get progressively tougher for as long as you can. It's fun and very challenging, but for my money the meat here is the co-op mode. Rather than playing through the entire game with a couple friends, you instead jump into specific scenarios that have you save some folks, grab a treasure or something straightforward like that. However, it's quite a bit different than what you'll come across in the single-player game as enemies don't just pop up in front of you, they come from everywhere , quickly and in large numbers. You absolutely must communicate here (using a headset is key to winning) and you have to constantly check your surroundings lest you be shot point-blank in the back of the head with a shotgun. There's a lot to the strategy for every mode of multiplayer offered in Uncharted 2, but I don't really need to delve into any of that because it all plays exactly like the single-player game, which is fantastic news. For a game that relies so much on environmental traversal to be able to offer the same exact mechanics while playing online, Naughty Dog has really tied everything together brilliantly. If you like to get up high and drop down on your opponents in the single-player game, you can do that online. If you like to stealthily flank guys online and take them out silently, you can do that in the single-player game. The multiplayer is both a massive and natural extension of the single-player experience, and the fact that Naughty Dog was able to pull it off so seamlessly is applause-worthy."

        "Content": "Battlefield 3 suffers from an identity crisis.  It delivers scorching multiplayer, fitting of its decade-long pedigree of famously expansive big-team battles, but stumbles over a generic single-player campaign that feels like a different game.  While DICE may not deliver a memorable story here, it doesn't need to when Battlefield 3's online warfare raises every bar imaginable, delivering one of the best multiplayer experiences of the year. I doubt Battlefield purists will complain much about the campaign, honestly; I know you're enlisting in this battle to bring down entire armies online.   Editor's Note: This review covers PC only. Click here for Xbox 360 or here for PlayStation 3 .     From the beaches of Kharg Island to the hills of Damavand Peak, Battlefield 3's multiplayer maps provide an immediate sense of scale. Everything about their design screams size, personalization, and the need to take creative initiative to succeed. Choose to pop headshots from the prone position, spin barrel rolls in a jet outfitted with personal unlocks, or see how many dog tags you can knife from your opponents; Battlefield 3's multiplayer is about the freedom of choice.  The online fight feels like a geography lesson (in a good way). Depending on the game mode, each map utilizes a different area or shifts wider and wider as gameplay progresses. You might not see half of a map like Caspian Border or Seine Crossing during your first few Rush matches. Yes, certain areas feel empty and repeated map elements like shipping crates conjure deja vu, but the sense of scope is exhilarating. Where many online shooters teach you the nooks and crannies of every map, Battlefield 3 is a wide sandbox that encourages variety and exploration. Battlefield 3 shines in matches with 63 other players, where every bullet has a new enemy's name on it.   Running to the front lines.  Is the gameplay balanced? Battlefield 3's online teeter-totter comes down to personal preference. I've been pinned down at my spawn point in Operation Metro by a dozen, well-stocked snipers and I've taken over an entire conquest map single-handedly. I'm no Maverick in a jet, so I learned to rain down hellfire from a chopper. For any class or tactic that doesn't work, like a painter's palette, Battlefield 3 offers alternatives. All four streamlined classes (Soldier, Engineer, Assault, and Recon) get their own problem-solving unlocks, so leveling each one is paramount to sitting on top of the leaderboards.  Battlefield 3's rewards and progression will keep you coming back to its online rumble for a long time. From adding heat-seeking missiles to an Anti-Aircraft Tank to simply changing camouflage, there's always a carrot dangling just out of reach -- if you can wrangle the score to earn it. While the newly implemented Team Deathmatch modes encourage high kills and low deaths, Battlefield remains a team-based game where you can sit atop the scoreboard no matter how many times you've died. Heal an injured teammate, resupply a sniper, or make sure a tank gets fixed up, Battlefield is about working towards the greater good and it's just as refreshing now as it was in 2002 -- all while looking outstanding on PC.   From sun flares to smoke bursting from a collapsing building, Battlefield 3's Frostbite 2 engine provides marvelous visuals. It performs admirably on lowered settings, but for anyone who's doubled up on their NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580s, Battlefield 3 provides a gorgeous spectrum of environments speckled with detail to brag about. Nighttime elements present a stark intensity, with glowing fluorescent signs dotting the cityscape and street lights blinding you from seeing enemies. The waves crashing on a beach below a late-game villa are mesmerizing -- as is the simple scrub brush dotting maps like Operation Firestorm. At maximum settings, Battlefield 3 looks stunning.   Nighttime provides stark contrasts.  The engine isn't perfect by any means. I encountered prone legs jutting through walls, saw snipers half-buried in mountainsides, watched my dead body stick through the hood of a jeep, and even noticed a story character float in a straight line from point A to point B, walls be damned. I've seen flower pots float in midair, noticed AI soldiers in their shooting position long after death, and I somehow committed suicide by running over the lip of a crater. These glitches are annoying, but they don't break the game. But they do break the immersion of the story and in the case of an undeserved multiplayer suicide, cause unneeded frustration.  While longtime fans know Battlefield as a multiplayer experience, its campaign and cooperative experiences can't be ignored. For those of you more interested in the single-player campaign than multiplayer, definitely take note. Whereas both Battlefield: Bad Company games added a story underwritten with humor, Battlefield 3 takes a more serious path. Its tale of global threats reads like twenty years of military fiction thrown in a blender and turned into a checklist. WMDs? Check. Russians? Uh huh. Insurgents tucked into Middle Eastern alleyways? Yup. It's all there and woven into levels through the recollections of Sergeant James Blackburn during an interrogation (didn't we see this in Call of Duty: Black Ops?). There's inherent tension in the threat of a terrorist attack, but Battlefield 3's campaign feels like well-trodden ground.   In campaign, you can't fly 'em.  Battlefield 3's campaign does hit some memorable moments (especially in the graphics department), but as a whole it's trite and frustrating. The campaign jams Battlefield 3's multiplayer into a linear box where freedom of choice gets thrown out a non-destructible window. There are only a few buildings to blow holes in, barely any vehicles to take the wheel of, and quicktime events adorn enemy encounters in almost every level. While you can literally crash a helicopter on an opponent's head while parachuting to safety if you so choose in multiplayer, campaign makes you hit spacebar at just the right moment to avoid getting punched -- they're two different games.  The co-op missions surround the events of the campaign, yet feel more enjoyable as individual levels. Working with a teammate leads to more creative approaches of attacks, though the same AI frustrations are in place. While opening doors and during other set animations, AI enemies gain invulnerability. They also have an uncanny ability to pick you out of the crowd. Even while using an AI teammate as cover -- not standard operating procedure, I know -- enemies still find you.

Whether it's a grenade exploding without an indicator, a blast from an unseen enemy, or late-game quicktime event that introduces a new button, the campaign and co-op levels are a minefield of frustration -- especially when cranking the difficulty up to hard. All told, it's a brief affair -- I burned through the single-player portion in under six hours, the co-op content adds another two or three."

        "Content": "Five years after launch, Halo: The Master Chief Collection has finally fulfilled its full fan-service potential with the addition of the last missing game from the Xbox and Xbox 360 era, Halo Reach. It is a genuinely amazing package that now includes six of Microsoft\u2019s classic single-player and co-op campaigns and legendary multiplayer modes, at long last free of any red-flag technical caveats. 343 Industries deserves a ton of credit for sticking with it after a notoriously bad launch and completing the long-term renovation of the house while its occupants lived (and played) inside. It\u2019s admittedly a bit later than I\u2019d anticipated, but the love letter to Master Chief has finally been delivered. Crucially, matchmaking just works . I\u2019ve played around 30 rounds in the past week with no fuss, no drops, no lag, and no BS. As a longtime fan, it\u2019s wonderful that MCC\u2019s interface lets you make awesomely specific game mode requests. Want Big Team Battle in Halo 1? You\u2019ve got it. Want SWAT in Halo 2 or Halo 2 Anniversary? Done. Are you open to any of the games as long as you get an Oddball match? Ask, and ye shall receive. I searched my own Halo-fan heart for the most obscure scenarios I could think of and was obliged every single time. Even Firefight has been imported (from Reach) and it\u2019s still a blast; it\u2019s no wonder it helped fellow Xbox heavyweight Gears of War set off a wave of cooperative PvE multiplayer modes that\u2019s still going strong today. Every IGN Halo Review 12 Images Granted, I did often have to wait, sometimes for up to three minutes. Even though The Master Chief Collection is available to everybody on Xbox Game Pass and the community is healthy, this isn\u2019t quite like the Halo 2/Halo 3 heyday where everybody and their mother was playing and you could find a game in seconds. But in every single instance, I always got what I wanted. And when the rounds actually started, they were buttery smooth every single time \u2013 even in Halo 1, which was never designed for online play. Furthermore, quality-of-life features such as a Modern Controls option, customizable and highly specific thumbstick dead zone settings, a text chat window, and a bump to 4K and a now-rock-solid 60fps on the Xbox One X highlight how Master Chief Collection feels like a fresh, modern, living entity rather than just a five-year-old package of even older ports held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands.   Ryan's Ranking of the Halo Games (Overall, Campaign + Multiplayer)   Halo 2  Halo: Combat Evolved  Halo 3  Halo 3: ODST  Halo 4  Halo Reach  Halo 5: Guardians  What's your favorite? What's the best Halo game overall (factoring in campaign AND multiplayer)? Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 2 Halo 3 Halo 3: ODST Halo Reach Halo 4 Halo 5: Guardians Answer See Results  A quick word on Halo Reach, as it\u2019s the most recent addition to MCC and the first part of launching the whole package on PC. In short, for a nine-year-old game, it still looks quite good after its 4K cleanup on both Xbox One and PC, and it controls beautifully. 343\u2019s first PC game feels a lot more natural on mouse and keyboard than when Gearbox brought Halo 1 to PC back in 2003, and offers PC-centric customization options like FOV adjustments. Audio issues are a bit wonky right now, though, with sound levels for various elements being too loud or too soft, but it\u2019s more of an annoyance. If the rest of the Master Chief Collection\u2019s PC ports are up to this standard, that\u2019ll be excellent news. All of the previously included campaigns have aged gracefully, too. Halo 4 remains underappreciated, and with its 4K/60fps enhancement it still looks like a recent game on Xbox One X. Halo 3, ODST (also new since MCC\u2019s original launch), and Reach are largely unchanged outside of the resolution and framerate bump, and even Combat Evolved looks surprisingly clean, image quality-wise, for an almost 20-year-old game. It\u2019s a classic for a reason. Halo 2\u2019s Anniversary treatment, meanwhile \u2013 which enhanced both the campaign and a select group of multiplayer maps (everything\u2019s available, though most of it hasn\u2019t gotten the facelift) is holding up nicely. Here\u2019s what I said about it in my 2014 review, all of which remains true today: \u201cI jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011\u2019s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014\u2019s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges \u2013 I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they\u2019re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don\u2019t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary\u2019s parts \u2013 most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second \u2013 trumps its minor annoyances.\u201d   About My Original Review This one has always bothered me. See, I got my original review of 2014\u2019s Halo: The Master Chief Collection wrong. I held it for a few days after launch at the time, hoping 343 would patch up the then-four-game collection\u2019s catastrophic matchmaking and connectivity issues, and then I put a 9.0 on it on the strength of its four fantastic campaigns and the faith that the multiplayer issues would be resolved soon enough. As it turned out, of course, The Master Chief Collection didn\u2019t deserve the benefit of the doubt. What should\u2019ve been a dream package for Halo fans was instead a nightmare on the multiplayer side. And for our part, we learned an important lesson and soon began making more use of reviews in progress for server-dependant games in order to help prevent this from happening again. Fast-forward five years and a lot has changed. Xbox Game Pass is a thing now, and any subscriber gets full access to MCC. The Xbox One X also exists, and playing MCC on it gives you 4K resolution. Even better, the collection has grown to six games, adding Halo 3: ODST and, most recently, Halo Reach (including Firefight mode). The latter is also now available on PC \u2013 via Steam, no less! \u2013 and serves as the starting point for bringing the whole shebang faithfully to Windows, game by game, between now and Halo Infinite\u2019s launch in Fall 2020.

        "Content": "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the reason I play video games. From the smile plastered on my face during the opening montage to the disbelief that swept over me as Chapter 2 began to the middle of the night text message I shot a friend about a relationship reveal, I couldn't stop loving this touching, beautiful, fun and engaging game. From the moment the music swells on the title screen to the moment the credits roll, Uncharted 3 is a masterpiece. That shouldn't surprise you. The original Drake's Fortune set the bar for visuals and third-person adventures on the PlayStation 3. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves greatly improved on that, added multiplayer and climbed its way to the 2009 IGN Game of the Year award. Developer Naughty Dog spent the two years since then making bigger moments -- think platforming in a capsized cruise ship and surviving a cargo plane crash -- and working on the few complaints from the last title. Complaints primarily stemming from the fact that, to some, Uncharted 2 felt too much like the original Uncharted. Uncharted 3's tale sounds familiar. We have the same cast of characters in our handsome hero Nathan Drake and his seasoned mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan and the same general idea of a lost city that needs finding before the bad guys get there. But this isn't the games that came before. Uncharted 3's greatest strength is its unpredictability. From the barroom brawl that opens the game and introduces its new melee system to a mid-game conversation between villainess Katherine Marlowe and Drake that literally redefines a pillar of this franchise, I didn't know what to expect in Uncharted 3. Naughty Dog sets aside the betrayal/twist formula used in the first two games and focuses on Nate and Sully's relationship. It takes you to the precipice of the Uncharted hallmarks you might expect, lets you stare at them, and then veers off in another direction. For the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat. \u201c Yes, the gameplay still revolves around climbing walls and shooting bad guys, but refinement is found those mechanics. For the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat. Uncharted 2's clumsy stealth parts no longer exist. Running through levels and taking cover doesn't get old because Naughty Dog has done so much to merge the gameplay with the story, perfecting the pacing and making everything look fantastic in the process thanks to cutting edge graphics and excellent cinematography. The end product rises above what the buttons do and how you maneuver Drake. Calling it a game sells Uncharted 3 short. This is an experience, a complete package. 121 Images When I rant about why Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is better than just about anything on the market -- about why I think it's my new favorite game of all time -- I don't talk about the firefights, the new ability to throw grenades back at enemies or collecting the game's 101 well-hidden treasures. I talk about the heart-wrenching section where Drake is by himself and completely lost. He's on his last legs, he's desperate, and I'm right there with him. I'm pushing him through the journey at hand and it's clear that it's a game, but as he stumbles, seeks shelter and loses hope, my heart breaks. This is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years. \u201c In a way, this is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years. Players know the Uncharted cast. Most love the banter between Drake and Sully, the love affair between Elena and Drake or the one-liners Drake shouts to himself as the game goes on. Naughty Dog created a universe here that players feel connected with, but, again, the developers toy with that. They insert things that take the mentor/pupil relationship to another level. They flesh out backstories, they break bonds, and they make us face the characters' worst fears. And, no, those fears aren't clowns. A story-driven affair, Uncharted 3's believability and connection with the player comes from its performances. For the third game in a row, the cast dazzles. The actors record their lines along with their movements, and this leads to characters that feel real. The chemistry between them lights up the game in a way most mediums would kill for -- from tiny touches like fist bumps to major moments of bickering between lovers. Add in a musical score that accentuates the action and layer on the game's trademark, \"best in the industry\" graphics -- sand clinging to Drake's hair, fire creeping up walls, sunlight filtering through tattered roofs -- and you can see where this game becomes more than pressing the X button and jamming on analog sticks. When the tale finishes, you can look forward to multiplayer. Uncharted 2 introduced competitive and cooperative modes for the series, and Uncharted 3 improves them to make something special. The standard menu returns (team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc.), but Naughty Dog adds bonuses known as Boosters and Kickbacks to round out the experience. These are upgradable bonuses that you equip to make the multiplayer experience more your own. Boosters augment your entire session -- one reduces respawn time, one lets you climb faster -- whereas the in-match medals you earn count toward unlocking your Kickback, which can instantly spawn an RPG or double your cash earned for a short period of time. These spice up the gameplay; you can pepper them into one of your four saved loadouts and have a skill set for any situation. This stuff will keep me coming back. Even when I have a terrible match in Uncharted 3 multiplayer, I see the cash I've earned counting toward my next level and I see my Boosters earning experience and becoming more powerful. Toss all this into the pot, and matches in Uncharted 3 multiplayer feel fresh every time. The verticality mixed with gunplay leads to different attack plans. There's a sweet science to deploying a Kickback at the perfect time for a critical kill. New Power Plays give teams getting blown out a leg-up like double damage so that everyone feels like they have a shot at competing. Plus, three team deathmatch (2v2v2) is awesome, and you can play split-screen with two different PSN profiles, a rarity on the PlayStation 3. For many of you, these multiplayer facts aren't news, as fans have been playing the final version of multiplayer as part of a North American Subway promotion for weeks. However, there was an outcry when the beta went live because Naughty Dog adjusted the damage dealt by bullets and players were now able to absorb more. Many threw their hands up in disgust, and Naughty Dog listened. The developers went in and dialed the damage back to what it was in the summer beta. Don't mistake this anecdote as a mistake; it points out the commitment Naughty Dog puts into this multiplayer community. The developers make a game and they want people to enjoy it, they listen to feedback, and they act. There's not much more you can ask from a game creator, and it's one of the reasons I want to keep playing and keep leveling. Add in the fact that Naughty Dog supported Uncharted 2 multiplayer until now and already has seven DLC packs planned for Uncharted 3 multiplayer , and it's clear this game has legs."

        "Content": "What if Call of Duty was different? This appears to be the defining question informing the direction of developer Treyarch\u2019s latest, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. While large portions of the design conform to the tenets established by prior iterations of the franchise, the unparalleled wealth of gameplay options and brilliant twists on the formula have shaped Black Ops II into the most ambitious and exciting Call of Duty ever made. It occasionally feels like the team might have strayed into territory they\u2019re not quite masters of, but significant tweaks to the multiplayer loadout system, as well as the realization of player agency in the campaign, make this far more than \u201cjust another Call of Duty.\u201d This is an evolution.  You Can Shape It, but This Story Isn\u2019t About the Hero The campaign narrative jumps between various characters\u2019 perspectives and also in time. The Cold War-era missions follows characters such as Alex Mason and Sgt. Frank Woods from the first Black Ops, while the 2025 missions follow Alex\u2019s son, David. All of these soldiers\u2019 fates are intertwined with the villain, Raul Menendez, and his organization Cordis Die. Menendez is the sort of villain you just can\u2019t seem to kill and, consequently, who knows how to hold a grudge. Thing is, he\u2019s not your typical, \u201cI\u2019m evil cause I do bad things,\u201d bad guy. Menendez is a tragic character, a product of imperialist nations\u2019 meddling during the Cold War and a survivor of some truly traumatic experiences. The story successfully casts Menendez in a light where I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about him. At times I wanted him dead, while at others I felt like he had a right to want revenge. Hell, I even vacillate between agreeing with his end goals. Like the film Inglourious Basterds, Black Ops II becomes less about you and the \u201cgood\u201d guys, and more about the motivations and perspective of the villain. The very fact that I\u2019m still thinking about how the story played out -- something unprecedented in a Call of Duty campaign -- is a testament to the strength of the writing. A great narrative already makes Black Ops II stand out in the pantheon of Call of Duty campaigns, but where it really sets itself apart is the addition of player choice and consequence. Moments and devices that would otherwise seem irrelevant -- like whether you find all of the intel in a level or choose to shoot someone -- can come back to haunt you, hurt you or help you. Failing objectives might result in new or more challenging missions rather than a restart screen. It\u2019s a brilliant riff on the traditional Call of Duty campaign design, and, combined with the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings. Most importantly, choice makes you apart of what you play; it\u2019s not just a story, it\u2019s your story. I may not have found the ending of my first playthrough satisfying because terrible things happened, but I appreciated that it was a direct byproduct of my actions. The effects of your choices are often evidenced in the new Strike Force missions, shorter objectives which give you control over a group of soldiers and various drones. Sometimes these objectives are a result of your decisions and performance, and they tend to have tangible effects on the outcome of your story. These tasks are worth playing because of their crucial role in the creation of your story, but the limited command controls make them less exciting. You can order your troops around the map from a strategic overhead view or via the usual first-person control, though neither is as tactical as intended. You can\u2019t rally soldiers on your position, and your AI allies will rush to die. Each objective essentially comes down to ordering my troops to move from point to point as a huge group while I single-handedly save the mission by taking direct control and fight a horde of foes. The importance of Strike Force\u2019s outcome adds tension and stress to the action, but the ineffective input and inept allies create an unnecessary challenge that compromises its potential success. Shooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missions and intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film. In that sense, Black Ops II is the classic Call of Duty formula at its best, with an important, defining difference: The emphasis on drone warfare, the exotic-but-grounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably high-tech signage and architecture makes Blacks Op II feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into non-historical settings. The team at Treyarch brings a bit of the multiplayer loadout flavor to the campaign as well. Before each mission you can now customize your character\u2019s weapons (restrictions apply to make sure you\u2019re not using a future weapon in the past, for instance), accessories and even give them perks. Every level also has challenges associated with it, and you can scope out the leaderboards to see how you stand up to your buddies. These are small details, but they\u2019re important because they layer on another reason to replay the stages. If for some bizarre reason the narrative doesn\u2019t grab you, then you still have lots of additional goals to try and achieve that are decidedly more \u201cgamey.\u201d  Take Your Class and Love it While not as big of a departure in structure as Treyarch\u2019s single-player, Black Ops II\u2019s multiplayer dares to defy the modus operandi, and provides a number of new options and modes that make it more engrossing than what\u2019s come before. Call of Duty has shaped the way other shooters present class and loadout designs for years, and Treyarch successfully redefines the standard with the Pick 10 system. The hook of Pick 10 comes from the ability to defy the loadout rules. Each attachment, weapon, grenade or perk counts as one of your ten points, and you can swap them out at will to create a huge number of combinations. Treyarch has also added in Wild Cards, which allow you to spend additional points to break even more rules, like equipping two primary weapons or up to six perks. Pick 10 allows the creation of the most specifically tuned classes in any shooter ever. You want to have a soldier with a pistol, four perks and two throwing axes? Do it. Maybe you want to snap three attachments to a LMG, ditching your grenades to give yourself additional perks or a badass secondary weapon for close quarters combat -- you can do that too. Pick 10 accomplishes something I didn\u2019t even realize I wanted: For Create a Class to be as exciting and enticing as it was when I first popped in the original Modern Warfare. I don\u2019t just experiment because I want to create a loadout perfectly tailored to a specific mode, but because it\u2019s a genuinely fun and intuitive system to use. A number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in Black Ops II. For instance perks now only affect your character, leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon. Thus if you want to do something like fast reload, which will make longtime players look for the Sleight of Hand perk, you\u2019ll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip attachment. The Kill Streak system has also been wisely replaced by Score Streaks, making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in, and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score. This accomplishes a majorly important feat: it makes every game less about your Kill / Death ratio. Sure, it still won\u2019t keep people from obsessing over it, but if you want to get it higher you\u2019re going to need to help with objectives. While I appreciate the rush that leveling up and unlocking items provides, it always felt strange to reward you with a stat reset after hitting the cap and Prestiging. Apparently some wise people at Treyarch agreed. Unlike previous games, after each of the 10 levels of Prestige you won\u2019t have your stats reset, but instead continue your weapon experience and challenge progress and earn even more rewards. For starters you now get a token that allows you to unlock any item regardless of its level requirement, forever. In addition you also get a Prestige Token that nets you either an additional Create a Class slot, a refund on all unlock tokens you\u2019ve spent during your progress to date, or the more traditional character wipe that resets all your stats. This completely changes my attitude towards Prestiging, and makes it something I actually want to do. As for modes, we get the time-tested classics TDM, CTF, Search and Destroy, etc., as well as some variations that keep multiplayer from feeling like a simple rehash. First there\u2019s Hardpoint, a version of Halo\u2019s Crazy King mode. You battle to capture specific points, holding them for as long as you can to rack up points. It\u2019s not exactly original, but the way it focuses the fight around specific points stands as a perfect example of how new modes can make specific Score Streaks and loadouts more viable (Take the Defender Score Streak on Hardpoint, you can thank me later). Another excellent addition to multiplayer is the option for multi-team battles. Returning modes like Kill Confirmed are a lot more interesting with four teams of three, and this option breathes a bit of new life into modes we\u2019ve all played to death. And of course you can still play these in four player local split-screen play, or take two people and go online. For all the years Call of Duty\u2019s been around, though, it\u2019s never quite managed to make it easy for new players to get into the experience right out of the gate. You pretty much jumped in right after campaign and started the level grind alongside players who have the skill of cyborg ninjas, which isn\u2019t exactly a fun introduction. Treyarch\u2019s changed this in a couple of important ways with Black Ops II, though, starting with Combat Training. From levels 1-10, new Call of Duty players can join others in battles against bots. After 10 you can still fight bots, but you\u2019ll only ever earn half the experience, ensuring no one uses this to level easily, but also keeping you from feeling forced to join public games to proceed. If all you ever want to do is smash bots with your buddies, you can create Custom games and fill them out with AI opponents, tweaking everything from the victory conditions to the player health to the amount of items and classes people can take in their loadouts. There\u2019s also a number of Party Game options, which still net you experience, and allow you to change up multiplayer pacing with sillier game modes like Sticks and Stones (crossbows, throwing axes and ballistic knives only) and One in the Chamber (your gun has only one bullet until you score a kill). There\u2019s simply more ways than ever to just have fun with Call of Duty\u2019s multiplayer in Black Ops II. Treyarch\u2019s also improved the competitive aspect of Call of Duty with the inclusion of the forwarding thinking League Play mode. League Play allows you and your friends to create teams, complete with a unique name and emblem, and hop into matches with everything unlocked right from the start. You simply play a few placement games to get matched up with similarly skilled teams, and then head out to see if you can earn your way to higher tiers. It\u2019s a proven system that\u2019s resulted in much fairer matches for strategy games like StarCraft II, and a welcome reprieve for those who want to skip the level grind entirely and just focus on tactics and skill building. People love to criticize the length of Call of Duty games, and if Black Ops II were only a campaign that might make sense, but this argument falls apart once you look at how much content is included. The legs of the franchise come not only from the single and multiplayer components, but, in the case of Black Ops II, from the increasingly robust and easy-to-use social features built right into the game. The Theater system was always really cool to me, but a bit too complicated for my tastes -- until now. You can still create films with a number of tailored shots, or you can just hit a single button and the game will automatically compile a decent highlight reel ready for easy upload to Elite. Elite\u2019s engaging tools and slough of helpful and interesting info can provide useful insights about you and your friends performances, potentially improving your game, but it\u2019s disappointing it\u2019s still only available for PS3 and Xbox players. Like the level creator in LittleBigPlanet, some of Black Ops II biggest multiplayer social features \u2013 namely, COD Casting and streaming \u2013 interest me more as a consumer than a creator. Whatever your preference, you can now shoutcast live matches in specific instances such as Custom Games for tournaments, getting a host of data about every player\u2019s performance. You can also watch replays, utilizing the codcast controls to get additional features which should give people with home capture setups more options.* Or if you want to try your hand at streaming, you can do that too by syncing your YouTube account with Black Ops II. The quality and framerate of the stream isn\u2019t the best, and it only works with League Play matches, but both streaming and COD Casting offer ways to connect with the community that despite their limitations feel ahead of their time and unlike anything else the competition brings to bear.  It\u2019s Time to Use Your Braaaiinssss Black Ops II\u2019s Zombies mode is the deepest the franchise has seen, even if its \u201ccampaign\u201d narrative is reliant on the self-imposed stories arising from your roaming, zombie-slaughtering adventures with three pals. The thing is, even if Tranzit doesn\u2019t come together as a traditional campaign, it\u2019s still a fun alternative to the otherwise serious CoD gameplay. The ridiculousness of the Zombies world is pervasive, and the constant banter between characters, the silly robotic bus driver or the horror movie camp that saturates every second keeps things light. Moreover it\u2019s a lot of fun to do something cooperative in Call of Duty. Fighting off increasingly difficult waves of undead inspires a different sort of tension than anything else the series has to offer, and with Zombies, it\u2019s just about goofing off and having some laughs rather than trying to be the best. Tranzit offers not only a different pace from the rest of Black Ops II, but also rewards exploration with new mechanics, secrets and easter eggs that encourage you to try it over and over. It\u2019s intentionally designed vague, leaving you to your own devices to find random objects to combine into machines or defensive items in the environment. Once you build them you\u2019re given no explanation about how to use them. It\u2019s a bit aggravating, sure, but when you stumble upon a solution it\u2019s also really rewarding, especially when that knowledge is applied to your evolving Zombies routine Zombies mode is filled out with Survival mode and the new competitive Grief mode. Survival feels a bit hollow now that there\u2019s the option to play in the larger Tranzit world, but it\u2019s an alternative for people who\u2019d rather just defend a single area and forgo all the exploration. Grief is another silly addition to zombies, pitting two teams against one another in an effort to see who can hold out the longest. You can\u2019t directly harm one another, but you can stun them when they try to revive their buddies, or even throw meat at them to make them more attractive to the undead legions. Both Grief and Survival feel more like afterthoughts when compared to Tranzit, but they were fun distractions nonetheless, and, alongside custom game options, provide even more ways to lose hours and hours to Zombies.  Which Platform Should You Play? We played on 360 for review, but having spent time with the PC version we can safely say they're virtually identical. The PC version doesn't have Elite, but it does feature additional options that PC players expect such as remappable controls and advanced graphics settings. Essentially, what it comes to is this: pick up the version where you'll have the most friends to play, because long after the campaign is over you'll have hours of awesome multiplayer and zombies to dive into. The PS3 version got off to a rocky start, with console lock ups, issues where multiplayer games just wouldn't launch and a host of other infuriating problems. Thankfully, though, things seem to have cleared up after just a couple of days, with even more patches on the way to shore things up in the near future. At this point the PS3 version feels virtually identical to the 360, with only occasional texture pop in and framerate drops that ultimately don't detract from the overall experience.  Level for level, gun for gun, the campaign, multiplayer and zombies content of Black Ops 2 on Wii U is almost the same. This version may cut the livestreaming feature, and currently doesn\u2019t have Elite, but it makes up for it with some nifty GamePad functionality. The GamePad really steals the show on Black Ops II Wii U. While you can play with a Wii remote and nunchuck, a classic controller or even the new Wii U Pro controller, the GamePad\u2019s button layout feels closest to what you might expect coming from the 360 or PS3 versions. It also offers some touchscreen options in multiplayer that are sometimes useful, and completely optional to use. You can change your class without having to bring up the start screen, for instance, or call in Scorestreaks with on-screen buttons (less than ideal in an intense situation, but it is optional), or use the GamePad as your minimap regardless of what controller you\u2019re using. Moreover it\u2019s built-in screen offers functionality that no other platform has. Namely, the ability to play any portion of the game via SecondScreen gameplay. Black Ops 2 occasionally drops in frame-rate no matter how you play it, but both regular and SecondScreen gameplay function well enough that I never felt at a disadvantage or that it took away from the fun, even when playing the super speedy online multiplayer. Even cooler, you can play online split-screen multiplayer without having to actually split your screens. You can still play with two people on the same TV, or, thanks to some brilliant designers, use the GamePad as your second player\u2019s screen. One additional caveat about Black Ops II on Wii U: Its multiplayer is every bit as fun as that on other platforms, but hardly anyone is playing right now. I could easily find games of Team Deathmatch, but finding games in other modes or in League Play is currently nigh impossible."

        "Content": "[Editor's Note: This review and score replaces our original November 2015 review. Read more on IGN's re-review policy .]  The tension before you breach a room in Rainbow Six Siege is often palpable. I\u2019ll place a charge on one door while our sniper Glaz watches the windows from outside, and then wait for our teammate playing Dokkaebi to distract the enemies with a phone call before blowing it wide open. Coordination is key, and working together to get the most out of each our Operators\u2019 abilities can be even more valuable as landing a good headshot \u2013 though the headshots definitely help.  Siege has come a long way since it launched two years ago (read our original Rainbow Six Siege review ). A steady stream of new maps, operators, and cosmetic items - along with a heaping helping of bug fixes, balance changes, and stability improvements - have slowly transformed it into a much deeper competitive game, even if there are some growing pains that come along with that. Siege has always been a fun and challenging FPS, but as it enters its third year it has gained a pull that\u2019s become hard to resist.   The core of Siege hasn\u2019t changed; a 5v5 dance of attack and defense between well-equipped military special forces squads on compact but complex maps. A wonderful emphasis on strategy and smart play over pure twitch aiming gives it a distinct feel that you don\u2019t get from games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Often times figuring out which door to barricade and which to break open can win you more games than just being able to outgun your opponents.  Learning which door to barricade can win you more games than just outgunning your opponent. \u201c  Each round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled drones. It\u2019s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious, Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of as much information as possible. It\u2019s only a minute long, but there are a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great.  Most of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They\u2019re also littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn\u2019t get any better.   There are currently 15 maps in the casual matchmaking queue, only nine of which are in ranked, each visually distinct and set in different locations across the globe, which results in a fantastic amount of variety every time I sit down to play. I love that I often won\u2019t see the same map twice in an evening of games, but the flipside is that it takes longer to actually learn the layouts of those maps. Still, it\u2019s a tradeoff that ultimately improves Siege. Talking the Talk  Working with your teammates, either through voice chat, text, or just map markers and pings is a simple but extremely impactful thing you can do to get better at Siege. It can be a big ask to rely on the voices of internet strangers (and Siege definitely has its fair share of unfriendly and unhelpful players) but overall I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by how this community understands and embraces good communication as a tool.  A great example of how communication can win games is with security cameras and drones. You can use cameras to mark the location of enemies for your whole team, but doing so will also warn the marked player that they\u2019ve been seen, often resulting in them quickly hunting down and destroying that camera. But if you don\u2019t mark enemies, and instead talk to your teammates and tell them where that person is, you can give them the same information without alerting your opponent. You can still use those same cameras after you\u2019ve died too, which cleverly cuts out a lot of down-time as you continue to help any surviving teammates.   Of course, you\u2019ll still run into plenty of people mindlessly tagging with cameras in public matchmaking. Like many competitive games, Siege is almost always more fun when played with friends I can comfortably coordinate with. Timing breaches and calling out flash grenades will let you get the drop on a defending team, but the short two to three-minute rounds and setup period between those tense moments also leaves room for goofing off in between.  Bringing the grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble, so plan carefully. \u201c  Siege has just three PvP game modes, all of which revolve around one team protecting a room (or two rooms, in the case of the Bomb mode) and the other team trying to break through their defenses. They are different enough in subtle ways that influence what walls you want to reinforce or which operators you should use - for example, bringing the blind grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble - but the general approach either team takes in a given mode can feel a little too similar.  As a side activity to the competitive battles there\u2019s the PvE Terrorist Hunt mode and the single-player Situations. Both of these modes are great, and I often find myself warming up for PvP by taking on the AI first. The Situations are runs through the same multiplayer maps against AI, and can feel as compelling as a fully built-out single-player mission at times, which makes it a bit disappointing that we haven\u2019t seen any new ones as everything else grows around it. (The first season of year three begins in March, and is expected to add a new kind of PvE mode called Outbreak, which will hopefully be a bit of what I\u2019m hoping for.)  Role Call  Another way Siege has grown is its ever-expanding cast of Operators. Sixteen new characters have been added so far, which makes a current total of 36 with eight more coming in the next year. The result is more dynamic and varied matches, both in how you play and who you have to play against. Unlike the maps, it\u2019s much easier to remember what each operator does, which helps the large roster not feel daunting to learn. You only really have to keep track of their special ability and what type of gun they might be using, but they\u2019re still unique enough to leave ample room for different playstyles and strategies.  Every Rainbow Six Siege Operator (Year 1 and 2) 36 Images  An operator like Mira completely changes the landscape of a map when picked, with the ability to put impenetrable one-way mirrors into otherwise solid walls. Other operators like Caveira, who can silence her footsteps and then interrogate downed enemies to learn the position of their teammates, or Vigil, who can become invisible to cameras and drones, are built to be played as aggressive, roaming defenders. Their presence enables new strategies that simply weren\u2019t as viable at launch. Abilities like this have changed Siege in very real ways, and the increased options keep Siege from ever feeling repetitive.  Better still, the benefit of that variety can be felt even if you don\u2019t have these new operators unlocked for yourself. I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any given character, as very few operators in Siege feel like either \u201cmust picks\u201d or completely underpowered. I wished I could use certain locked operators, sure, but the 20 base operators that have been there from the beginning are still strong, fun, and varied enough to make the significantly higher Renown cost (Siege\u2019s in-game currency) of any that came after them less frustrating.  You don\u2019t start with any Operators unlocked, with the original 20 costing between 500 and 2,500 Renown, a relatively small amount that comes quickly enough from playing matches. All the new operators, however, are a massive 25,000. It can take at least 20 hours of play (on the low-end) to gather that much renown, but you also have the option to buy operators with real money for $5 a pop.   With only eight released in a year, 25,000 renown isn\u2019t so hard to collect for regular players who have kept up to date, but it\u2019s pretty steep for newcomers who are trying to catch up. Siege does feel like it has been set up to encourage players to spend real money on its year-long passes, which provide every new operator released in their given time period (plus some extra premium currency and other goodies) for $30. It\u2019s akin to an annual subscription fee, but nearly everything but some premium cosmetics can be earned without spending any money beyond buying the base game.  It's disappointing that the Year-One operators haven\u2019t dropped in price since their release. \u201c  That said, I\u2019m disappointed that the Year-One operators haven\u2019t dropped in price since their release. The Year-One and Year-Two passes have both left the store, and the one option to get them cheaper is a slightly discounted bundle only available for real money. I\u2019d love to see these older operators drop to a Renown cost to make them more inviting to new players once their release hype has long passed.  The store, in general, suffers from growing pains that Siege has yet to address. A massive amount of cosmetic gun skins, gun charms, and operator outfits are available, with new ones arriving as often as weekly. Nearly all of these cosmetics can be unlocked with Renown, and some of them are extremely cool. The gun skins, in particular, tend to be varied and gorgeous, everything from being textured like gems to having detailed tigers stretching up the barrel. Many of the most recent operator outfits and headgear options have started branching into cool and creative territory beyond just different shades of camo, like Valkyrie\u2019s Pop Art make-up or Blackbeard\u2019s dapper top hat.  The problem, however, is that the store itself has become a big pile of stuff that\u2019s nearly impossible to navigate. It\u2019s hard to browse and hard to search, especially when it comes to bundles. Items will helpfully tell you if they are available in a bundle, but there\u2019s no way to then go to that bundle directly, and the bundles tab is an ungodly long text list with a single image to explain everything that\u2019s in it.   Siege wisely keeps the items in its store away from anything that really affects gameplay. There are a variety of gun scopes and barrel attachments that can be unlocked with Renown that do offer mid-match advantages, but they are cheap enough that this power boost never felt walled off or like it was compromising balance.  And, once again, what your gun looks like and the scope you are using can mean next to nothing if your opponent can simply outthink you. Siege has continued to double down on that focus on smart play over the years, and it\u2019s made it a game I want to keep playing for a long time to come. Looking forward, Ubisoft has already laid out a free update plan for Siege\u2019s third year, including eight more operators, two new maps, and the Outbreak game mode, meaning things don\u2019t show any sign of slowing down."

        "Content": "Jason Brody cries out in horror the first time he watches his brother murder a man. When the sibling kills again, there\u2019s a vulnerable tremble to Jason\u2019s whimpering whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Grant.\u201d Shortly afterward, in a moment of panicked self-defense, Jason rams a machete through an attacker\u2019s throat. Far Cry 3 establishes a bleak and mature tone out of the gate. Jason, our protagonist, should fear the pirates running the tropical retreat of Rook Island. In his eyes, killing is not cool . Not yet. The emotional weight only gets heavier as he tries to save his missing friends from slave-trading psychopaths. In turn, Jason\u2019s gradual transformation from coward to killer unfolds in a natural, believable way, which compensates for the narrow revenge premise. As its unpredictable, often uncomfortable story comes unhinged, Far Cry 3 challenges players\u2019 principles: How far would you go to protect the people you love, and what kind of person would you become to get them back? Jason\u2019s allies and enemies don\u2019t feel like video game characters \u2013 they feel like people. \u201c Jason begins his evolution after escaping the clutches of Vaas, the mentally unstable leader of a pirate gang and the man who\u2019s kidnapped his friends and family. Before having you hunt down Vaas, Far Cry 3 focuses nearly an hour on teaching you survival skills. Jason scavenges supplies, harvests plants, and crafts useful items from animal skins before ever firing a gun at a man. Choose not to take advantage of the wildlife at large and you\u2019re missing out on important upgrades; bigger wallets hold more cash to buy better weapons, weapon holsters house additional firearms, and larger rucksacks store more goods. Motivation drives exploration because there\u2019s a purpose for everything on Rook Island. The many secrets hidden in its gigantic, open world aren\u2019t arbitrary video game collectibles. Lost letters from World War II detail past struggles on Rook Island. Stray memory cards detail the depravity of its drug operations. Disregard the first-person shooter veneer \u2013 yes, this is a violent action game, but that\u2019s a small slice of a grand adventure. There\u2019s a history to Rook Island that bolsters the astonishing sense of place established by the captivating culture and scenery. You\u2019ll explore ancient underground ruins, walk among the locals, and buddy up with the leaders of the native Rakyat tribe. It\u2019s this allegiance that puts Brody on his dark path.The Rakyat can give Jason the power he needs to save his friends, brother, and girlfriend. This is where Far Cry 3\u2019s character progression comes in. The more brutally and often he kills, the more experience Brody earns to become a better murderer. Before long, the man who couldn\u2019t handle the sight of blood learns to chain vicious machete executions, fire pistols from ziplines, and throw knives into eyeballs from 20 meters out. Fear disappears. Jason starts enjoying the slaughter. Loss of control is an important theme throughout Far Cry 3. Jason and the majority of the main cast have a hard time keeping it together, either because they\u2019re coming unglued or have already lost it. Jason\u2019s allies and enemies don\u2019t feel like video game characters \u2013 they feel like people, largely because the fantastic performances are among the best acting in video games. Vaas\u2019 manic outbursts make you fear his volatility; his madness is amusing until he snaps. His boss Hoyt is frightening because he\u2019s as intelligent as he is irrational. As a wise old butler once said, some men just want to watch the world burn \u2013 Hoyt wants to profit on scorching the earth. Meanwhile, Vaas\u2019 rivalry with the Rakyat gives him a reason to put Jason down. Jason, while not necessarily likable, is a great lead because of his relatable flaws. He and his friends lived a posh, pre-paid life in Santa Monica, but immaturity strained his relationships and ambition. Murder is the first thing he\u2019s been good at and he starts living for it. \u201cIt feels like winning,\u201d he tells a freaked-out friend. And it does. The allure of Far Cry has always been the open-ended tactical choices available during each encounter, and the variety of ways you could take down targets. With dynamic variables like aggressive wildlife and roaming pirates, your stealth and aggro options open up more than ever. I loved letting bears and tigers out of their cages in pirate outposts \u2013 the animals took care of the dirty work for me and I\u2019d claim the enemy\u2019s checkpoint as my own. Causing panic is great, too. Like Far Cry 2, Molotovs or explosive barrels cause chaotic fires that trap and burn enemies. You can combine these last couple things if you\u2019re a real sicko \u2013 flaming bears are a frightening sight. You could snipe thugs from a mountaintop, drive into a camp with Rakyat warriors (or C4 charges) in the back seat, or use a knife and bow to kill quietly. If you\u2019re really bold, why not stab a couple guys after dropping from your hang-glider? The satisfaction of claiming an enemy stronghold as your own is the same regardless of how you get it done. These bases become hubs for selling loot found in chests, buying better weapons, and attaching scopes and silencers. Better yet, they\u2019re fast-travel spots, allowing you to navigate Rook Island\u2019s breadth efficiently. Outposts are a great convenience, but they also represent something larger. Where Far Cry 2 positioned you in the middle of a civil war to play both sides, Far Cry 3 gives you a one-sided goal: Take over the island and spread the Rakyat tribe\u2019s influence. This is the imprint Jason leaves on the world, and the reason he\u2019s destined for Rook Island. Multiplayer, on the other hand, retains very little of what makes Far Cry 3\u2019s single-player campaign special. The combat is still fast and engaging, but it\u2019s less tactical with fewer attack opportunities. Maps are cluttered and often confusing, too, so navigating to the next objective can be challenging. Taking over control points in the adversarial modes ends up as aggressive games of tug-of-war that any shooter vet is more than familiar with. The competitive incentives function much like Far Cry\u2019s contemporaries, too, with weapons and attachments unlocking with each level-up. This speaks to the multiplayer\u2019s overall ambition: It\u2019s serviceable, but is afraid to do anything other than explore old territory. The extensive map editor, which allows for terrain deformation, the addition of wildlife (including sharks that swim on land, angry tigers), and custom-created objects, presents the chance to make something better. The cooperative mode shares the predictable progression system, but compensates with a character-driven side-story campaign focusing on entertaining moments rather than depth. Those characters are as uneven as the co-op design, though. Mikhail the Russian and Callum the Scot are funny dudes whose one-liners make them feel like unlikely action heroes. Their partners, on the other hand, are obnoxious, annoying clich\u00e9s who feel like they just learned about profanity. Co-op leaves the open world behind in favor of linear levels with branching paths \u2013 with three or four players, taking advantage of high ground and flanking positions gives your team an incredible sense of empowerment. With just two, it becomes a frustrating grind. Enemies don\u2019t scale, and the missions are specifically designed for four people. You\u2019ll need a full crew to protect bomb-carriers while blowing up bridges or guarding vehicles from enemy waves. At times, it feels like a mindless shooter with senseless direction, but there are brief bursts of friendly fun in blowing up walls, driving quads, and wiping out hundreds of enemies. Both online modes feel superfluous and out of place, but neither is bad. Both serve a purpose for a certain crowd, but the kind of person who connects with Jason Brody\u2019s story likely won\u2019t fall for simple co-op and a forced-but-functional competitive side."
