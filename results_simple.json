        "Content": "Almost everything about Eagle Flight is surprising. Somehow, flying high above a deserted Paris in VR doesn\u2019t induce nausea. Somehow, quickly navigating tight environments using your head and neck feels smooth and responsive. Somehow, its in-flight escort missions aren\u2019t frustrating, but fun. The novelty soon wears off, but what\u2019s there reaches greater heights than many PlayStation VR games accomplish. Eagle Flight has a fantastic control system that\u2019s easy to learn, comfortable to use, and responsive enough to allow for some seriously challenging level design. Looking around makes slight changes to your direction, while tilting your head results in large swoops and u-turns. A brief and effective tutorial showed me the ropes in no time at all, and soon I was soaring between buildings and through trees with no issues. Even after a few hours of non-stop play, I was nausea free. That includes time at high altitude, where everything is far enough away to feel slow, and time in some of the fastest, most narrow challenge levels, where collisions can happen at any second. It\u2019s so comfortable that I\u2019d often ignore objectives and just fly around for fun. Spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while you\u2019re flying. \u201c Your controller is used for speeding up, slowing down, and things like firing your \u201cweapon\u201d (a shriek that emits a powerful sonic blast) at enemy birds. It was smart to keep directional control entirely off the DualShock 4, as it\u2019s simply not needed and might have complicated things. Plus, with less to worry about, you can spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while you\u2019re flying. In fact, I highly recommend doing that. Post-Apocalyptic Paris  A great control system wouldn\u2019t mean much without a beautiful place to fly though, but post-humanity Paris is a great choice for it. In fact, Eagle Flight begins with quite the strong impression. You\u2019re flying above a city, and as you swoop lower you see zebras and bears on the streets. Eventually, you realize the whole city is green \u2013 probably too green \u2013 and then it dawns on you: people don\u2019t live here anymore. If you\u2019re a bit slower on the realization, an overgrown Eiffel Tower should do it. Animals and cars can look blocky, but that\u2019s only really noticeable at low altitude. For much of the time I spent flying, the world looks great, and you have the best view in the house.  18 Images  The difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. \u201c In story mode, progression through the sections of Paris is quick enough to stay interesting, and the difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. Missions range from collecting feathers (a throwback to Ubisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed if there ever was one) to navigating abandoned subways to escorting injured eagles to safety -- all while fending off pesky vultures and crows with your supersonic breath blasts. None of these activities would be exceptionally fun on their own, but the flight mechanics are so enjoyable and easy to use that adding an extra responsibility or two makes for a good challenge.  A few of the modes can be unreasonably challenging thanks to a narrow field of view. For example, when the crows you\u2019re chasing learn the ability to leave behind wind traps it can be almost impossible to dodge them if the level design includes tight turns or narrow spaces. There\u2019s also a mode that leads you through rings (yes, like Superman 64). Hitting the center of the ring gives you a speed boost, and therefore a better time and a higher leaderboard result. However, Eagle Flight only shows you the current objective ring and the next one, and the rings are often close enough together that it would be helpful to see at least the next two or three when you\u2019re moving at that speed. Losing a mission or earning fewer stars because of guesswork isn\u2019t a great feeling.  Two Birds, One Stone  The four-hour campaign does a fine job of preparing you for multiplayer, which definitely has the unique factor going for it. It\u2019s capture the flag as birds, and the flag is an animal carcass. It\u2019s fun, but limited.  With simple controls and only a handful of defensive or offensive options, only rudimentary teamwork is possible. You can defend your flag-carrying teammate using your eagle screeches, and trying to score all alone rarely works. The lack of additional modes soon gets repetitive, but like the rest of Eagle Flight, multiplayer succeeds on the strength of its controls and just how comfortable it is to play. Just don\u2019t expect to play it for months. "

        "Title": "Jetpack Joyride Review (iOS)",
        "Subtitle": "Fruit Ninja developer Halfbrick has released its most addictive game yet. Jetpack Joyride is a must-own!",
        "Content": "I played Jetpack Joyride  way more than I needed to for review. Halfbrick's latest endless runner kept me coming back round after round thanks to its rock-solid, responsive controls, and an extremely well-thought-out metagame.  If you're anything like me you spent many perfectly good hours of your youth playing The Helicopter Game on various flash game portals. Jetpack Joyride is essentially The Helicopter Game on uber-steroids. Instead of a helicopter, gamers play as Halfbrick mascot Barry Steakfries, wielding a stolen machine gun jetpack.  You use said jetpack to hover over and under lasers, electrified zappers and fast-moving missiles, all in an attempt to escape the lair of an evil scientist. Like all endless runners, escape is impossible. The only goal is to progress as far as possible, to climb the Game Center leaderboards.  Profit bird!  Maneuvering the jetpack is easy: tapping or holding the touch screen fires the guns, lifting Barry into the air; releasing the screen makes him drop. It's simple, but necessarily so once you take into account Barry's physics. The more you play Jetpack Joyride, the more you get a feel for its subtleties. IGN tip: feather the jetpack, to ensure a nice smooth ascent \u2013 too much upward or downward momentum will catch you off guard, leading to an early death.  The core jetpacking action feels spot-on \u2013 the controls are very responsive, ensuring that skilled players will post higher scores. But Halfbrick smartly included the perfect amount of randomness, to keep Joyride spicy. Players never quite know where the next missile will come from, or how the next set of lasers will be configured. It makes narrow escapes feel exhilarating. Thankfully, Steakfries occasionally commandeers vehicles to help players on their escape. Our personal favorites are the Angry Birds send-up \"Profit Bird\" (it literally leaves a trail of money in its wake), and the appropriately-named \"Crazy Freaking Teleporter.\"  Mastering the Crazy Freaking Teleporter.  Joyride's excellent mission system is what kept me coming back to for \"just one more round.\" Players always have three current missions to work towards, pulled from a much larger mission pool. They range from the simple (play three games) to the tricky (reach 500 meters without collecting any coins) to the downright weird (rub your head on the ceiling for 2000 meters). As missions are completed players earn new titles for Barry. After reaching the final rank, the cycle can be started again via a Call of Duty-style prestige system.  Halfbrick has stuffed Joyride full of extras, keeping the replay value high. A slot machine after each round doles out bonuses. Comprehensive stat tracking lets you pour over all your performances. A store allows you to upgrade Barry with useful (coin magnet!) and not-so-useful (tuxedo!) upgrades. The attention and care Halfbrick put in to Joyride is apparent at every turn. ",

        "Content": "As it\u2019s existed on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC for the past three years, Overwatch is one, if not the singular best game I\u2019ve ever played. The moment-to-moment action, flexibility, and lashings of style in this team-based hero shooter all combine to make it a special experience. On Nintendo Switch, however, that exhilarating gameplay is too often robbed of the true greatness it achieves on other platforms. The perpetrators of this theft are a number of technical and control issues that make the Switch a tough place to play Overwatch. It\u2019s still fun, but if you\u2019re coming from somewhere else it\u2019s hard to get used to. Overwatch is still one of the most gratifying multiplayer shooters I\u2019ve come across. The flexibility it offers and range of ways to approach each match is what has had me coming back for over 650 hours on PS4. As you can imagine, switching over to another platform after all that time was going to take a little getting used to \u2013 and even then, it\u2019s not a great situation.  Check out the reveal trailer for Overwatch on Switch below : Concessions have evidently been made to bring Overwatch to our sweaty palms, and they are clear from the get-go. When docked, we\u2019re talking 900p, and it definitely shows when put side-by-side with the other versions. Textures aren\u2019t nearly as detailed, clothing and hair look flat and solid, text is slightly blurry and without its crisp edges, and the overall image seems washed out, as if someone has slapped a desaturation filter over it. McCree\u2019s poncho looks like it\u2019s made from matte plastic rather than tailored cloth, and Winston\u2019s furry tufts resemble a Simpsons character more than an actual anthropomorphic ape. While looks aren\u2019t everything, the fact that distant enemies can often appear as a fuzzy silhouette can actually have an adverse effect on the way you play. Trying to snipe as Hanzo can be difficult when it feels like he\u2019s in need of a trip to the opticians. It\u2019s by no means a bad-looking game, though, and when played in handheld mode a lot of my qualms are reduced. Overwatch\u2019s strong art direction shines through and still makes it one of the best-looking games on the Switch outside of Nintendo\u2019s own games. Maps such as the sun-soaked Ilios and canal-laden Rialto pop off the small screen amid bursts of gunfire and all other means of weaponry. From a visual standpoint, playing handheld is the best way to enjoy Overwatch on Switch - but that is totally at odds with the best way from a control perspective. 647 Images The Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons \u2013 whether attached or in the Grip \u2013 just don\u2019t allow for the level of accuracy required for a high-speed shooter like Overwatch. Their analog sticks often feel stiff and can result in jerky movements when aiming, rather than smooth tracking while aiming down sights. Characters such as McCree and Ashe, in particular, are difficult to use as a result, with headshots becoming much more of a challenge to execute. Melee-based heroes such as Reinhardt or Brigitte are easier to use as they don\u2019t require anywhere near the same level of accuracy. It\u2019s terrible that a good number of heroes are a lot less fun to play though, and that leads to a level of roster imbalance not often associated with Overwatch. The Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons [...] just don't allow for the level of accuracy required for a high-speed shooter like Overwatch. \u201c Playing with a Pro Controller solves many of these issues \u2013 its ergonomic design feels much more natural for a shooter. Using a controller that works similarly to what I\u2019m used to on home console, every character on the roster feels a viable option again. But in a way that makes the issue worse, because the playing field is made so imbalanced in favor of people who\u2019ve paid for a $70/\u00a350 peripheral. It also presents a major contradiction: Overwatch plays best with the Pro Controller, but looks best when played handheld. That means there is no ideal way to play it on the Switch, unless you count pulling out the kickstand, placing it on the table and playing with a Pro Controller in your hand while leaning forward and squinting at the small screen. But who really wants to do that?  Watch Overwatch on Switch in action below : Perhaps the biggest addition accompanying Overwatch\u2019s move to the Switch is the incorporation of motion controls. When booting up for the first time, these gyroscopic tools are automatically turned on, which can be quite jarring at first. I brazenly tested them out to snipe with Widowmaker and quickly realised the error of my ways: they simply don\u2019t have the level of sensitivity needed to rely on them solely for aiming. As I waved my console around, my reticle roughly followed its path \u2013 before a Reaper appeared before my eyes and put a bullet between them. After several attempts I began to hit a sweet spot: using the right stick to aim before using the motion controls to fine-tune my aim slightly produced better results, but still didn\u2019t find it particularly satisfying. It just feels nowhere near as responsive or smooth as micro-adjusting Link\u2019s bow in Breath of the Wild does. I tested motion controls out with a few more characters before turning them off altogether, deciding that at best they\u2019re a novelty, and at worst a hindrance. It just feels nowhere near as responsive or smooth as micro-adjusting Link\u2019s bow in Breath of the Wild does. \u201c On the more positive side, Overwatch on the Switch does come with its own native voice chat, a big plus when considering the majority of games require a separate app to do the same thing. It works effectively as well - turning it on is  as simple as plugging a compatible headset into the Switch\u2019s headphone port, just like in Fortnite. There are a number of other technical issues that trip up the minute-to-minute enjoyment, though. Frame rate is capped at 30fps, which instantly feels at odds with the fluid nature of Overwatch as it exists on all other platforms. Worse, it\u2019s not locked at 30 and it dips below even that when a lot is taking place on screen, which is a frequent circumstance in this game. A Zenyatta Transcendence coupled with a D.Va self-destruct and a Lucio Sound Barrier thrown into the mix can lead to some serious slowdown \u2013 a particular issue when you take into account that these Ultimate abilities are designed to be used in tandem. On top of that, character models often take a few seconds to load in when spawning or changing hero, and Play of the Game highlights can sometimes appear with invisible characters. (And, crucially, there is no save-clip option on these highlights, and even the Switch\u2019s native capture function is disabled.) It\u2019s a baffling exclusion for a game centred around exciting moments, particularly for someone like me who isn\u2019t afraid to share a highlight or two on social media.  Watch the trailer for this year's Halloween Event below : Like other versions of Overwatch, you also need to have an internet connection to get into a game, which makes playing while you\u2019re out and about a virtual impossibility. This was to be expected, but it would have been nice to see at least the training modes available while offline for the sake of portability. They\u2019re not. Even when it\u2019s not at its best, Overwatch is still fundamentally fun and the best shooter on Switch. \u201c And yet, despite all of these technical issues being noticeable, they\u2019re almost never game-breaking, and during the heat of a thrilling point capture or overtime scramble never entirely killed the fun. Even when it\u2019s not at its best, Overwatch is still fundamentally fun and the best shooter on Switch. Very few other games anywhere offer the same level of excitement on a game-to-game basis as this."

        "Title": "NASCAR The Game 2011 Review",
        "Subtitle": "Cement-footed racing without finesse.",
        "Content": "NASCAR The Game 2011 is eight weeks deep into the racing season on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , but the Wii version only now approaches the starting line. While Eutechnyx hit some high points on the other consoles, this Wii outing simply doesn't deliver on graphics, options, and overall experience.  The Wii's only other NASCAR outing was 2009's NASCAR Kart Racing. In a lot of ways, the Wii is much more suited to a cartoon-themed take on the sport than this dumbed-down version ported from more powerful consoles. By forcing the original game into the constraints of the Wii's power, the final product looks quite similar to NASCAR games from the turn of the century (though with a smoother frame rate, to be fair). Every line has stark pixilation and the backgrounds are a splash of blurriness. The crowds are a blocky mess of bland color. Even the fanfare events, like flying jets and spraying champagne, simply spurt large squares of smoke and booze, respectively.   Stuck in the pack.  While the intention behind the game was to provide an intense and realistic experience, the Wii's cement-footed controls don't allow for such finesse. Rather than slowing down cleanly to approach a curve, the controls only allow for releasing the gas and slamming on the brakes -- there's no in between.  Navigating the game's races requires a smooth ability to turn, so throwing a foot on the brake simply doesn't cut it.  Players can either use a nunchuk and remote combo or the Wii Wheel to race their way through the Sprint Cup. While the nunchuk allows for more precise handling, the motion-controlled turning does create a fun experience for anyone who simply wants to jam on the gas and move forward. The left and right turning motions are clean and responsive, but again, without a pressure-sensitive gas and brake, one only has so much control.   Sliding without really crashing.  With its simplified appearance, the Wii's NASCAR The Game 2011 does manage to pull off a more consistent wave of the yellow flag. Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions were spotty in their use of cautions, but the Wii manages to catch when the race needs to reset. Despite this addition of penalty consistency, the black flag remains tucked away. Even with the flags, the crashes in this version of NASCAR simply aren't that exhilarating. Cars rarely flip and a pileup only involves cars pressed tightly together.  NASCAR The Game 2011 on Wii lacks the tuning options of its console-cousins. While a pit stop can tweak tire pressures and a few other factors, there's no pre-race tuning ability available to create the car setup needed for any particular track. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions allow cars to be tuned and saved to any track in the game, so the Wii's lack of a custom garage is a glaring omission. In addition, the Wii doesn't allow players to paint cars to their liking outside of unlocked paint schemes.   Split-screen with a friend.  After winning a race the game presents the ability to gratuitously celebrate a victory by spinning donuts for extra experience points and playing a long, drawn out car-top fist pump and a blast of champagne to cover adoring bystanders. While some celebration is well deserved, it's hilarious to watch the older drivers climb up on the cars to celebrate like the youth around them using the same animations.  NASCAR The Game 2011 on Wii also lacks online multiplayer. While the other consoles had their fair share of technical glitches in online races, the Wii only supports split-screen action. While it's fun to tinker around a track with a friend, this means the majority of one's competition comes from A.I. alone.",

Asus ROG Keris II Ace Michael Higham There is a small control panel under the bottom bezel that lets you access and adjust the monitor's gaming specific features, which is a much easier way to do it than dealing with an on-screen display. It contains two arrow buttons (left and right), a Black Stabilizer button, Game Mode button, and a Dynamic Action Sync (DAS) button. All controls and their navigation are intuitive. The Black Stabilizer brightens up dark scenes and I found this pretty helpful while searching for hidden enemies in the shadows. DAS minimizes input lag and it makes sense to leave this on all time, although you can\u2019t use DAS and Motion 240 blur-reduction at the same time. Motion 240 blur reduction does what you'd think it does, but it only works at 100Hz or 120HZ, and it's LG\u2019s attempt to make moving images appear smoother and more fluid and it\u2019s better for watching video than for playing a game though because of the increased input lag.  The included Game Modes are something a detail-oriented gamer will find indispensable as it lets you group together settings for brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, color temp, black stabilizer, response time, DAS mode, and Motion 240. It\u2019s helpful to be able to manage so many different settings as a group. This will be of the greatest benefit to gamers who play a variety of games under a variety of ambient lighting conditions as they can tweak setting to their heart\u2019s content and then save them as presets for ready access. Game Modes include Gamer 1, Gamer 2, Gamer 3, FPS 1, FPS 2, and RTS and the only rub is that enabling them also turns on a feature called Super + Resolution, which sharpens the edges of images in a way that I didn\u2019t like. You can change the parameters of all of these settings and more using the full on-screen display (OSD).

Macy Performance The 24GM77 has great gaming performance and handled everything that I threw at it with ease. I tested using my PS4 connected via HDMI and my gaming rig connected via DVI. One note, to run at 144Hz, you'll have to use either DVI (dual-link) or DisplayPort as HDMI is limited to 60Hz. Playing Call of Duty Infinite Warfare on both the PS4 and the PC was very smooth and fast. With DAS enabled everything looked and felt snappy and responsive. Overall the 24GM77 provided a great gaming experience.  Turning on the Motion 240 blur-reduction has a detrimental effect on performance and a decrease in contrast. Motion 240 can\u2019t be used at a 144Hz refresh rate and it also prevents the use of the lag reducing DAS. A higher refresh rate with DAS on provides such strong gaming performance that turning off Motion 240 and accepting the slightest amount of blur is the way to go. The 24GM77 provides accurate colors that are slightly on the warm side, although not overly deep and rich. Colors were bright and evenly saturated. Grays are very good, although not perfect. Black contrast is very strong. When viewing grays and blacks together, the grays have a tendency to look a little washed out. Viewing angle performance is good but not great. With the 24GM77 in landscape mode, horizontal viewing angles are excellent with virtually no color shifting or loss of brightness almost up to 180 degrees. However, viewing from a 60 degree top angle resulted in a washed out image and viewing from a similar bottom angle resulted in a significant decrease in brightness and color accuracy. When I rotated the 24GM77 to portrait mode, the horizontal viewing angles were terrible. Fortunately, you\u2019ll never play a game in portrait mode. One final performance note, I\u2019m not a big fan of the plastic arm used to adjust panel height. It does not slide up and down very smoothly, so when I tired to lower it a hair it would drop three inches instead. You\u2019re going to want to set it once and then leave it alone.

The development team addressed my biggest issue by swapping the terrible stylus control in favor of traditional D-Pad control as the default setting, which is good. But gone is the single cart multiplayer, which is bad. Very bad.  This makes absolutely no sense to me. What's the point of re-releasing an existing sports game to the Nintendo DSi Shop for a cheaper price, but removing one of the features that made it somewhat noteworthy? What's even more criminal: not only is single cartridge multiplayer taken out, VT Tennis doesn't support multiplayer, at all.   No multiplayer in a rerelease of a once-multiplayer DS game. That's just downright baffling. And as my original review of Rafa Nadal Tennis informed, the single player component isn't bad if you play the game using the D-Pad and buttons and forgo the gimmicky touch screen controls. The graphics are tight, the animation fluid, and while it seems a bit light in features the fact that it's an inexpensive download makes the limited features list acceptable.",

With the help of developer Player First Games, Warner Bros. is trying to use the seemingly endless list of movie and TV studios it owns to do just that, bringing together an eclectic roster of fan-favorite characters that somehow includes Harley Quinn , Bugs Bunny , and Shaggy all at once. While the result makes for some gleeful multiplayer chaos, MultiVersus is ambitious in its laser focus on competitive multiplayer too. That\u2019s left some of the more casual aspects undercooked, but its prioritization of 2v2 online matches still makes for a fresh take on an increasingly crowded genre. Unlike last year\u2019s competent yet underwhelming Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl , MultiVersus clearly has significant support from the Warner Bros. family and, more importantly, the budget to follow through on Player First\u2019s vision. Not only are iconic faces like the DC superhero trinity of Superman , Batman , and Wonder Woman available to pilot, but so are characters from Steven Universe , The Iron Giant , and even Game of Thrones. The open beta\u2019s initial roster of 17 is a tad small for my taste, but I\u2019m not worried about it in the long term as the cast is already set to expand in the coming months \u2013 basketball and Space Jam superstar LeBron James was just added, and Rick and Morty are supposed to join him in August . MultiVersus Characters 20 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask While compact, the roster is diverse and brimming with personality thanks to its impressively faithful voice cast. Having actors like John DiMaggio (Jake the Dog), Kevin Conroy (Batman), Matthew Lillard (Shaggy), and Maisie Williams ( Arya Stark ) reprise their roles goes a long way toward making these characters feel authentic. It\u2019s great to hear the voices I remember from cartoons and movies I grew up on bantering with characters they\u2019ve never had the chance to meet before. Beyond the recognizable, I dig additions like Reindog, too, an original creation that opens up the possibility for more new faces to join the fray down the line. Puncha Some Buns Matches in MultiVersus play out as either 1v1, 2v2, or four-player free-for-all battles in places like a spooky Scooby Doo-inspired mansion or the gadget-ridden cavern of the Bat Cave. Unfortunately, the sparse selection of stages are bland and lack identity beyond those two standouts. The other three locations look like they could take place anywhere despite supposedly being based on memorable sites like the Adventure Time treehouse. Thankfully the music does help make up for this, and I look for any opportunity to brawl in the Sky Palace just to hear its wonderful instrumental cover of the Steven Universe theme. Like in Smash Bros., your goal is to build up damage on your opponent in order to make it easier to send them flying off into the void at the edge of the screen for a kill. Characters have two attack buttons to work with, representing normal hits and flashier special attacks, with different moves performed by pointing the analog stick up, down, or to the side while unleashing an attack. It\u2019s recognizable, but a well-executed system, and controlling your character is as quick and fluid as I\u2019d hope the chaotic gameplay of a platform fighter would be. Controlling your character is as quick and fluid as I'd hope. \u201c I almost always feel in complete control, which can be attributed to the tight mobility options available to most of the roster. You can use double jumps and dodges to navigate the airspace, escape danger, avoid projectiles, or line up a devastating assault of your own. A change from the norm is a lack of ledge grabbing, which is why Player First has opted to enable wall jumps that make for exciting, daring saves by sticking to the side of the main platform and leaping to safety instead of falling to your doom. Another big departure is that the 2v2 mode is meant to be the main way to play, making MultiVersus refreshing and setting it apart from its peers. These team battles are a lot of fun, with each character assigned a class that promotes a specific playstyle to help compliment a partner. Whether that\u2019s the frontline tanks, the hard-hitting bruisers, the agile and deadly assassins, or the trickier ranged mages and support classes; everyone has a role to play in a fight, and your team composition can be vital to succeeding against experienced challengers. It\u2019s great fun discovering how Bugs Bunny and his toon gimmicks pair with the protection and crowd control provided by Wonder Woman\u2019s moves. While I naturally gravitated towards tanks like Superman and The Iron Giant, I\u2019ve also been having a blast learning the intricacies of playing support as Steven Universe and learning about each character to be a better teammate. Rollback Netcode With how important the online modes are to MultiVersus, the rollback netcode running remote multiplayer sessions has to be great, and it has been across most of the well over 100 matches I have under my belt. A large majority of fights have played out with smooth and responsive controls on PC and Xbox, both with wired and wireless connections. I have run into some issues online, although it\u2019s fewer than I can count on one hand. However, in those rare times when a connection is bad, it\u2019s chaotic and near unplayable, with characters warping around the stage or running aimlessly off a cliff only to appear a few seconds later just yards away. Thankfully, moments like that are the exception rather than the rule. You can equip up to four different perks before every match, adding a level of customization to enhance your playstyle, support your partner, or even try to counter your opponents\u2019 team. Three of those can be perks that affect attributes like movement speed or damage dealt, which is amplified in power if your teammate equips the same one. Signature perks fill the fourth slot, modifying specific character attacks and abilities, such as leaving flame walls in the wake of Iron Giant\u2019s jet boosters or Taz hacking up an anvil if he eats an enemy projectile. Perks add a meaningful layer of strategy to each match that I appreciate in every mode, but especially when I\u2019m playing alongside someone I can build a gameplan with. The unfortunate side effect of that focus on competitive 2v2 is the absence of meaningful local multiplayer options. Currently, you can play with up to four people on one device in team battles and free-for-alls, just like online, but there isn\u2019t enough here to keep my interest with friends if I want to have a chaotic anything-goes party experience. Items occasionally populate in the FFA game type, but none of the rocks, dynamite, and ice weapons are remotely entertaining to use or add surprising moments to the mayhem that\u2019s already playing out. Local multiplayer also means the lack of stages is more glaring, making MultiVersus a disappointing game for casual fun overall. A Caboodle of Collectables Characters and perks have to be unlocked, but thankfully MultiVersus takes a big step in the right direction when it comes to free-to-play fighting game monetization.  While the free-to-play model comes with a lot of negative connotations and possible pitfalls, it also has the potential to be a boon for fighting games by allowing more people to casually try a game without having to drop a dime on it if they don\u2019t want to. And crucially, Player First has ensured everything that affects gameplay is accessible simply by playing, avoiding any pay-to-win concerns. Perks are only unlocked either by leveling up characters or by spending the free gold currency that\u2019s earned from playing matches and completing various daily missions and reward tracks. Characters, on the other hand, can be bought with gold, the real-money premium currency called Gleamium, or Character Tickets which are available to those who buy the optional founders packs. Only four characters are unlocked from the start, but I\u2019ve found playing just a couple of hours will earn enough gold to unlock someone new. There\u2019s a nice pace to learning a character or two and then moving on to a new one when you have enough gold. Gleamium and Premium Item Pricing Gleamium can be purchased in bundles of 450 ($4.99), 1000 ($9.99), 2200 ($19.99), and 6000 ($49.99). Variant costumes currently can cost 500, 800, 1500, or 2000 Gleamium depending on the rarity, and characters are each 700 Gleamium if you want to forgo paying the 1500-3000 free Gold. Character emotes can cost 200, 350, or 500 Gleamium depending on whether it's uncommon, rare, or epic rarity, respectively. Ringout animations are 800 Gleamium for rare and 1200 Gleamium for epic items. That means pretty much no matter what item you are looking to buy, the Gleamium bundles won't quite line up with the price. Do you buy cosmetic items with real money in free-to-play games? Yes, regularly Sometimes, but not often No, never Answer See Results Gleamium is also used to unlock multiple cosmetic items like character variant costumes, emotes, profile icons, ringout animations, and more. These cosmetics are fun, especially the skins that change the entire aesthetic of a character down to the voice lines, like the Cake the Cat costume for Jake. However, some of the pricing on these items don\u2019t align well with the bundles of Gleamium that can be purchased, which forces you to buy more than needed \u2013 that\u2019s not a new business practice, but it\u2019s still a lame one. If you want to invest in Luau Velma or a Batman: The Animated Series skin, it\u2019ll cost you. They\u2019re by no means necessary to purchase, but if the right skin comes around, such as Black Lantern Superman, I\u2019ll definitely be tempted to swag out my main fighter if the price is right. Not every cosmetic costs Gleamium, and there are other ways to snag some of these items in the free and premium season pass rewards and by leveling up each character. I love that these reasons to keep playing and engaging exist even if I\u2019m not throwing down money."

        "Content": "Everybody knows Lady Dimitrescu is tall, but I was still shocked to see just how large she loomed over me from a first-person angle in VR. Resident Evil Village VR captured my undivided attention even beyond my fascination for the tall vampire lady, offering a fresh perspective on a nearly two-year-old game I have played a dozen times over. From the robust tutorial before you start playing to the many ways you can customize the controls for the most comfortable experience, Resident Evil Village\u2019s VR mode is no afterthought, but rather a well-crafted and exciting way to experience an already excellent game. Nothing has been watered down in the transition to VR: you\u2019ll endure Ethan\u2019s rescue mission from start to finish. That said, this mode doesn\u2019t quite give you access to everything Resident Evil Village offers \u2013 the timed challenge Mercenaries mode is not supported in VR (probably for the best, given that it\u2019s all about moving quickly), and the modifiers you may have already unlocked in the non-VR mode, such as weapon attachments and upgrades, are not transferable to VR mode and you will have to unlock all those items once again. This obviously isn\u2019t a big deal for anyone playing Resident Evil Village for the first time, but as someone who has unlocked and upgraded all of my weapons over the course of several playthroughs, that was disheartening. Interestingly, Village VR does offer new weapon attachments, such as a bayonet for the M1897, which you can purchase from The Duke after destroying a certain number of wooden goats scattered throughout the village. What we said about Resident Evil Village Roaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors. I got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as I did retracing my steps through the gradually revealed recesses of its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast. Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode. The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads. But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistfull of Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s freakish fingernails. - Tristan Ogilvie May 5, 2021 Score: 8 Read the full Resident Evil Village Review .

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask Unlike the third-person mode available in The Winters\u2019 Expansion last year, Resident Evil Village mostly flourishes in VR. Exploring this remote European village, I\u2019ve never felt more immersed in the action. From using my hands to move shelves and barricade doors, to reloading my firearms physically, to drowning Ethan\u2019s hand in First Aid Med, Resident Evil Village VR captures a level of realism that is simply unachievable in traditional 2D first-person games. Village VR looks beautiful; you can easily get lost roaming its maps and taking a closer look at all the little details in the environment. Castle Dimitrescu often had me doubling back to examine all the paintings and photographs on the wall. That said, because the action is all up in your face, it is easy to spot the low-res textures on some things while exploring, most notably the rotten food that is littered throughout the village. Nothing has been watered down in the transition to VR. \u201c Resident Evil Village VR\u2019s controls have all of the expected options, allowing you to play either standing or sitting, each with its own pros and cons. Playing standing provides easier access to your arsenal, but usually meant I couldn\u2019t play for as long without fatigue, while sitting down extended my play time but could cause some uncomfortable angles when throwing pipe bombs or using the scope to aim with a sniper rifle. Customizing the control scheme is helpful for either method, allowing you to swap between options like physically reloading weapons manually or having that be handled automatically. I opted for a hybrid of the two as it was really fun mimicking the motions of using a real firearm, but in situations where a lot of action was occurring and things got hectic, it was convenient to have my guns automatically reload. Knife combat has also been greatly improved; what was once limited in movement and stiff with a controller now feels extremely smooth and responsive as you take actual swipes at your enemies and crates alike. (Or you can punch every crate you see; that\u2019s pretty effective, too.) The more interesting thing I discovered when playing with the knife, however, is that you can throw it without worrying about collecting it after because it immediately respawns in your holster a few seconds later. That makes for a handy way to kill enemies and destroy boxes from afar without using ammo. Taylor's Top 10 Resident Evil Games My personal selection of the best Resident Evil games, in no specific order. See All Resident Evil 2 Capcom Resident Evil Village Capcom Resident Evil Capcom Production Studio 4 Resident Evil 4 [VR] Capcom Resident Evil 7 Biohazard Capcom Resident Evil 2 [1998] Capcom Resident Evil 5 Capcom Resident Evil Outbreak Capcom Production Studio 1 Resident Evil 3: Nemesis [1999] Capcom Resident Evil 4 Capcom Accessing Ethan\u2019s arsenal is done with your hands, pulling weapons and ammo from different areas of your body. While the idea is immersive, the different ways you have to access your weapons can be a bit cumbersome. Sometimes I went to grab a land mine only to pull out my flashlight instead, while other times I would reach for my shotgun only to grab my sniper rifle. I wish there was a hybrid option that allowed me to pull up a quick menu with four preset weapons of my choice, similar to what Resident Evil 4 VR offered, but that doesn\u2019t seem feasible given the lack of a D-Pad on PS VR2 \u2019s new Sense controllers. While I would sometimes forget Village has a block ability since I never had to use it during the base game (even when playing on the challenging Village of Shadows difficulty), it was my new best friend in Village VR. With the number of enemies coming at you all at once, plus the high stress of trying to get avoid damage while simultaneously reloading your weapon, blocking became a very useful tool I hadn\u2019t previously relied on. Dual wielding makes it a lot easier to get out of tight situations. \u201c Blocking may have felt new, but one feature that\u2019s actually exclusive to VR is the ability to dual-wield weapons. This makes it a lot easier to get out of tight situations, or to simply bust open some lycan skulls faster. Weapons that were once used with two hands, like the shotgun, can also be wielded with one hand with the pistol held in the other. That\u2019s super convenient if you need to get a quick shot off at an enemy close to you, but it comes at the cost of more recoil decreased aim. There\u2019s a lot of fun experimentation to be done with the combinations of weapons alone, which makes for a welcome new level of freedom. However, some tension and jump scares I encountered in the original game were not as scary in VR. Sure, a few moments still left me in fight or flight mode, such as Lady Dimitrescu chasing me in her castle or when I encountered that one specific section in House Benevieto. But most of the jump scares can be entirely missed if you aren\u2019t looking in the right direction at the right time, which I learned the hard way the first time Ethan encounters a lycan. It doesn\u2019t put a major damper on things, but it can still be a bit disappointing. Every IGN Resident Evil Game Review Ever 60 Images Thankfully a lot of the tension and scares from Resident Evil Village come from the combat itself, which there is plenty of. There are a handful of sections where Village throws dozens of enemies at you at once, and the VR changes to combat mean you can now easily drop your gun when you meant to reload it, or forget to cock your shotgun after firing a shell. Similar to what I said in my review of Resident Evil 4 VR , this new combat style comes with a severe learning curve, which can sometimes be frustrating, especially in later sections. But trust me when I say that it\u2019s worth mastering, making the challenge all the more rewarding to overcome once you get the hang of it. Village VR shares some frustrations with Resident Evil 7's VR mode. \u201c Village VR unfortunately shares some frustrations with the VR mode for Resident Evil 7 as well \u2013 most notably, the animations that occur when enemies grab you or knock you down. Not only do they drag out the length of combat encounters, but they also put you into some extremely weird and awkward viewing, especially since you can easily look in another direction while the animations play out. On the flipside, Resident Evil Village\u2019s puzzles are much more fun to solve and interact with while hands-on in VR. These sections could feel a bit tedious and repetitive in 2D when you are just following cumbersome button prompts, but Village VR has you physically interacting with objects by doing things like flipping a switch to restore power to a room, or moving a statue to solve a puzzle, which makes them feel like more than just busywork."

        "Content": "Rather than wasting my time with some colorful journalistic jargon, I'm simply going to keep this short and sweet: Dragon Ball GT Final Bout is utter crap. Having said that, I'm sure you want to know why. So let me explain. The gameplay, or rather the lack of it, is the primary issue. This is mainly due to the diabolical controls. A good fighting game has fluid, accurate and responsive controls. DBZ's are choppy, inaccurate and totally unresponsive. You press a button to punch, and there's a huge delay before the character executes it. This is very frustrating, especially when combined with the spastic character animation, which jerks more than a horny gamer on a Friday night. Adding even more misery is the choppy camera movement. It's like being stuck in a spin dryer. One minute the camera is pointing up in the sky, the next it's zooming in on another character. The thing that makes it all horrible is the fact that the camera doesn't pan smoothly, it just switches from view to view, so you often get completely lost. Sometimes you don't even see the other character who you're supposed to be fighting. The final kick in the nuts is the fact that there are very few fighting moves. The basic moves are dull to say the least (kicks, punches, feeble ranged moves and seemingly random flurries), and combos are nearly impossible to pull off. The end result is the most limited and frustrating fighting action yet seen on the PlayStation. On the positive side, the graphics aren't too bad. The polygonal characters are very true to their anime counterparts, and the cool sound helps add audio-visual appeal. There's even a cool anime FMV on the front end. But as we all know, graphics and sound don't make a game, it's the gameplay that counts, and that's something that this game simply lacks. If you're a Dragon Ball Z fan, then you may like this game, simply because it stars all your favorite Dragon Ball characters. But to be honest, you might as well go out and buy all the toys -- at least they're more controllable. Jay Boor",

        "Content": "When Sony built the DualShock for the original PlayStation, it turned to Japan Studio to make a game that demonstrated the potential of its new controller. What we got was Ape Escape, the dual-stick controlled platformer that became an instant classic. Now Japan Studio has focused its attention on PlayStation VR and has created the best showcase of the hardware's potential I\u2019ve seen yet in Astro Bot Rescue Mission. Astro Bot\u2019s story is thin, but it\u2019s enough to justify its galactic adventure. The charming robots from the Playroom series are hanging out on their spaceship, practicing the floss dance, when a Big Bad Alien attacks their sentient ship and steals its VR visor, sending them scattering across the universe. The opening cut-scene immediately highlights the advantage of VR. The characters start way off in the distance, before quickly shooting down and getting right in your face, which made me instinctively shift backward in my seat several times. The traditional gameplay of guiding an onscreen character across precarious platforms and around deadly enemies is augmented by having you inhabit the body of another robot that looks like a limbless version of Nintendo\u2019s R.O.B.. You\u2019re actually in the scene, automatically progressing through each level as you control Captain Astro, moving your head to get the best view of the pathways ahead and around you. The new camera perspective takes some getting used to; initially I would instinctively turn away from a straight path to look at different parts of the level, only to turn back and find I\u2019d been leading Captain Astro off a ledge. Enemies can be bashed with a tap of the square button or destroyed with Captain Astro\u2019s handy foot lasers, which double as a means of extending jumps. There\u2019s not much variety to these enemies, but the simple rhythm of combat feels good. There are also enemies that ignore your robot pal and target you directly, spitting vision-obscuring goo onto the visor screen that needs to be literally shaken off. This shaking action is used regularly and is great in theory but I found when the action was hectic a vigorous shake of my head would dislodge the PSVR headset and necessitate a pause to fix. Ducking and weaving around slow-travelling projectiles is much more gentle and getting hit results only in a short shattered glass effect. The task of moving your body to avoid the attack of a robotic bee while trying to perform precise jumps across narrow gaps with a separate character feels like the video game equivalent of patting my head and rubbing my stomach.  Go Go Gadget Not every level requires this degree of dexterity \u2013 more traditional platforming fills out Astro Bot\u2019s five worlds. The controls are tight and responsive, and the platforming slowly ramps up in difficulty but always remains surmountable. What makes each level unique and constantly delightful is how camera control is used to create challenges. A level\u2019s path may lead above and behind you, forcing you to turn completely around in your seat. Other times there\u2019ll seem to be no way forward until you physically lean to the side to see a platform that was obscured by a pole. Some walls can be knocked down by smashing your face into them, and paths can be revealed by using one of the level specific gadgets. These gadgets might transform your in-game DualShock 4 into a grappling hook that can be used to pull down walls or create tightropes for Captain Astro to walk across, or a ninja star launcher that can slice through enemies and lodge shuriken into walls to create new platforms. They\u2019re all activated with intuitive touchpad inputs: ninja stars, for instance, are thrown with a swipe up and aimed by moving the controller around in space. Similarly, flicking the controller as Captain Astro balances on a tightrope slung between it and an anchor point sees him bounce high into the air. For the most part, gadgets work as intended, though I did have issues with the grappling hook distinguishing between me trying to pull a wall down and bouncing the line to move Captain Astro. Each level has eight crew members to rescue, coins to collect, and chameleons hidden in the environment to find. The little robots can sometimes be cleverly hidden, but their cries for help, delivered through PSVR\u2019s 3D audio, help to pinpoint their location. Rescuing the tiny automatons is a joy - after you give them a swift kick in the bum they soar up into the air before plummeting down into your controller. Any other rescued robots then pop up to cheer. It\u2019s a good example of the charming energy that pervades Astro Bot as a whole. Each level also has a camouflaged chameleon to find. I enjoyed having an excuse to pause to appreciate the level theming as I sought out a glimpse of a bulging chameleon eye, and collecting each level\u2019s hidden lizard unlocks a challenge level. These are significantly tougher than the main missions and a great inclusion. Trying to speed through a platforming challenge, for example, is all about finding a good rhythm and is immensely satisfying to get right. You're then rewarded with a gold or silver Astro Bot to add to your crew. Rounding out each world are bosses that range from a giant robot gorilla that will literally have you pulling teeth to a wig-wearing corseted spider whose webs are no match for some well-aimed ninja stars. The boss challenges are quite traditional in design, but their spectacle and VR presentation are some of Astro Bot\u2019s most impressive moments. That said, the late-game bosses ramp up significantly in difficulty and playing the same initial waves of a battle multiple times in a row led to some of my few moments of frustration in Astro Bot."

Macy The i-Care setting uses a sensor mounted on the front bezel to automatically adjust brightness based on room lighting. I preferred to leave i-Care off and adjust brightness manually for more precise control. Dynamic Power Saving (DPS) can decrease energy use by up to 50 percent at the expense of decreasing brightness. I preferred to turn DPS off and (again) adjust brightness manually. The next menu, Color Setup, contains settings to control color temperature. The default preset, \u201cwarm\u201d, appeared a bit cool to me. I suggest setting Color Temp to \u201cuser\u201d and then manually adjusting the adjacent RGB sliders. Dynamic Color Boost (DCB) enhances specific colors of the palette with settings like Sky-Blue. Being the purist that I am, I preferred to leave DCB off, but you might want to turn it on when looking at images that require color enhancement.  Gaming My objections to the G2460PQU\u2019s chunky design and complicated OSD faded away once I configured the various settings to my liking, and began evaluating picture quality using test patterns and playing games. I tested using my PlayStation 4 connected via HDMI and my gaming rig connected via DVI. I played Madden 17 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare on my PS4 and was more than pleased with the picture quality and no noticeable lag. Performance from my PC at 144Hz was even better with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, as they both appeared very smooth and responsive even while engaged in Battlefield 1\u2019s screen-filling mayhem. The G2460PQU provides an immersive PC gaming experience with fluid motion that lacks any visible blur.  Color accuracy is very good but not perfect. The G2460PQU exhibits thorough color space coverage with a slight over-coverage of green that was only noticeable during testing and not during gameplay. I noticed color inconsistencies such as weaker saturation in the bottom third of the panel. This bothered me during game play because the top two-thirds of the panel displayed a beautiful, rich color, and the bottom third looked slightly muted. Viewing-angle performance was consistent with other TN panels (meaning not good) and I saw color-shifting start around 70 degrees from center in any direction (side-to-side and up-and-down). Also, this monitor is available in both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync versions if you dig the style but want it with an adaptive refresh rate. Sound produced by the dual 2-watt speakers had good mid-range, non-existent treble, and bass that got distorted when turned up high. Gamers will want to rely on a headset or external speakers and use the built-ins as a last resort. Purchasing Guide The AOC G2460PQU Extreme Professional Gaming Monitor has an MSRP of $279.99 and oddly is often found for sale above MSRP. Amazon, however, is currently selling the model for slightly below the $279 asking price:   See the AOC G2460PQU Extreme Professional Gaming Monitor on Amazon  See the AOC G2460 Extreme Professional Gaming Monitor on Amazon (UK) "

        "Subtitle": "A blend of puzzler and strategy game wrapped up in golf-themed packaging. ",
        "Content": "      What+is+it?   Worms Crazy Golf is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Worms mixed with golf. It's the former influence that's dominant, though, with courses littered with exploding sheep, irate grannies, magnets, cannons, switches, suicidal worms in silly hats, and other staples of this British videogame institution. The idea is to bat the ball around the madcap courses and sink it in as few shots as possible, with the help of shot modifiers like reverse gravity, which makes your ball fall upwards, parachutes, and rocket blasts. It's smooth, colourful, inventive and devious \u2013 and above all, excellent fun.  It's got pass-the-iPad multiplayer and a plethora of unlockable clubs and hats that you buy with the coins littered around the courses, but really the replay value comes from the excellent course design. Five themed courses have eighteen holes each, interspersed with challenges like exploding as many barrels as possible with your golf ball or hitting precise shots at targets. It's the holy grail of mobile game design: at once simple to play and deviously deep.   Did+we+like+it?    It's ridiculously addictive stuff, especially when you realise that the real point of the game is figuring out how to manipulate each course to get a hole in one rather than just muddling through. The courses' individual quirks \u2013 cannons, ski-lift-esque transporters, magnets that repel or attract the ball, pirate and ghost worms and so forth \u2013 make each a unique challenge to navigate. It's also got a sweet but unobtrusive sense of humour that's just effortlessly likeable, despite the occasional annoying chirruping of the Worms themselves.   Should+you+buy+it?    For \u00a31.99/$2.99, Worms Crazy Golf HD is absurdly good value. Five 18-hole courses might not sound like all that much, but each individual stage is crammed with nuances and hidden crannies. Just getting through them takes five or more hours, but nailing a hole-in-one on each will take much longer \u2013 and multiplayer extends the lifespan, too.",

        "Subtitle": "Nintendo's classic, shameless Breakout clone.",
        "Content": "Alleyway's a rare example of Nintendo shamelessly copying another company's design. It's clearly a clone of Breakout , the Atari arcade smash that was all about smashing through a wall of bricks using a horizontal paddle and a bouncing, block-busting ball. Alleyway plays the exact same way, simply reimagining the paddle as an oblong spaceship with Mario placed in its pilot seat.  But even though Alleyway's unoriginal, it's still fairly fun -- and it at least introduces some variations on the old arcade theme. Every second level scrolls the to-be-busted bricks across the screen horizontally, challenging your timing and shot placement more than the static, stationary stages that always precede them. And every third stage, after that, marches its bricks vertically down toward your paddle -- closing in on your position and restricting the space you have to work with.  And every fourth stage? A just-for-fun, no-consequences bonus level where the bricks are laid out in a Mario-related pattern. You'll send the ball sailing through walls built to resemble Koopa Troopas, Bloobers and the mustached one himself. Good times.   Hey, I recognize this guy . . .  The four different varieties of stages add a bit of depth to Alleyway's design, but it's still the thinnest and least complicated back-catalog classic to launch alongside the 3DS eShop and its new Virtual Console brand. It's improved over its original cartridge version in this new digital edition, as you can now easily save your progress through your brick-blasting quest (which was previously impossible) and the sharper, more precise look of the graphics running through modern emulation make it much easier to track the movement of your bouncing ball than on an actual old Game Boy unit.  The biggest improvement has to be the 3DS Circle Pad, though. It's already helped make controlling Link feel more fluid in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX , and it was a perfect fit for piloting Mario's submarine and airplane in Super Mario Land 's two forced-scrolling shooter stages. But here it really shines -- it makes sliding your paddle to the left and the right feel silky smooth.  You can still use the standard D-Pad if you prefer, of course, but I can't imagine anyone would want to after feeling how much better the Circle Pad performs. Alleyway was already a rarity for being an unashamed clone of an earlier game, but it gains even more unique appeal for being a game that actually plays better when not running on the hardware it was made for.

        "Content": "It's been a long time coming, but WipEout HD is finally about to hit the PlayStation Network. The download-only title has been garnering plenty of praise and promise for a good while now, but does the final version live up to expectations?  Oh hell yes it does.  Taking a lot of elements from the excellent PSP titles WipEout Pure and WipEout Pulse, like the tracks and music, the game serves as something of a \"best of\" of recent titles in the franchise. But it's not just a repackaging -- this is as refined a WipEout experience that you'll find anywhere, one that is crafted to near-perfection and given enough polish and gloss that it could have been a full retail release and made fans happy. Given that it's one-third the cost of a full retail game, it's nothing short of a great bargain.   The most important part of any WipEout title is the smoothness of the experience. WipEout HD delivers in spades, running at a blistering 60 frames-per-second at any resolution, including 1080p. Playing like a half-roller-coaster-slash-half-combat racer, you're able to weave in and out of turns like a bobsled with a rocket affixed to its back. The controls are tied directly to the framerate and are immensely responsive. It's the perfect combination of dead-on controls and complex raceways.  Make no mistake though - this is not an easy game by any means. The first few grids won't pose too much of a challenge and will let you get through without too much of a fuss, but once you reach about the halfway point through the game, things start getting very tricky. Time Trial and Speed Lap times start getting lower and lower, and you'll have to not only race cleanly but hit every boost marker and find the perfect section to use your own boost (you get one per lap). The competition gets faster and more brutal, making better uses of their weapons and hitting more boost pads.  In short, the game gets tough . You may actually find that you will hit a wall at some point and will be unable to progress unless you're able to take your abilities to the next level (or you get super lucky). The issue here is that the point total that you may need to earn to unlock the next grid is much greater than the number of races in the grid, which means that simply getting bronzes in everything won't be enough (and after a while, even all silvers won't cut the cake). Nabbing golds is pretty easy at the start, but even placing gets really tricky later on, meaning that as the difficulty increases, so do the point requirements for getting to the next level.   The controls work perfectly, and the 1080p/60fps rendering looks fantastic. This isn't a complaint, entirely, but it's certainly worth pointing out as some gamers might get stuck and will wind up trying the same set of events over and over and over again to progress, possibly without ever actually doing so. However, the nice part is that the game does use the grid system, allowing you to choose from a number of events in each class to compete in, making the game feel a little less linear than it is. Also, by the time that you get about halfway through the game, you should have unlocked all of the vehicles and all of the tracks (though not the backwards variants), giving you access to most of what the game has to offer, so you likely won't feel like you're missing out on a ton even if you do get stuck.  WipEout HD does a good job of mixing up race types with the number of event variants present. You have your standard \"get to the finish line first\" race, Speed Laps (beat a single lap time), Time Trials (beat a multiple lap time), Zone events (keep going as long as you can while your speed keeps increasing) and Tournaments. It's not a crazy assortment by any means, but it's enough to break things up and the developers have done a good job of mixing them up in the event lists to keep things fresh.   As mentioned, WipEout HD uses a lot of the content from WipEout Pure and WipEout Pulse from the PSP. In fact, all of the tracks are taken directly from these two titles. In many cases, this would mean that fans wouldn't find anything new in the package, and that it wouldn't be a very compelling experience.  That's not exactly the case here. While we have seen these courses before, being able to race them in an HD experience at 60fps changes everything. The controls become more responsive, it's easier to navigate the tracks, and, obviously, everything looks much, much, much better.  WipEout wouldn't be what it is without weapons. You'll find a full suite this time around, giving you plenty of ways to take down your opponents. A number of different rocket types all do their jobs nicely: The Leach Beam will suck the virtual life (and speed) out of your opponents; and there's nothing quite like the ripple effect that the Quake weapon tosses out. There is a dud or two in the mix, however. The machinegun, for example, is better used to repair your ship than to actually fire.   The ability to absorb weapons and use them to refill your energy rather than using them for offensive purposes is a great mechanic, especially when you get to the later events in the game. Your opponents get aggressive enough with you (and each other) that you'll constantly have to watch your energy level and listen for the warning sounds, and you hear beeping, it's all the more important that you pick up a weapon to use as energy for yourself. The decisions get especially difficult when you're nearing the end of a rough race and you're in position to place, but you're almost out of energy. With a boost pad sitting right next to a weapon pad, do you go for the boost and try to finish higher at the risk of losing it all? Or do you play it safe, take the weapon pad and absorb the energy, and maybe not finish as high as you could (or even get passed up by an opponent that takes the speedy option)?  The WipEout franchise's soundtracks have always been an integral part of the experience, and WipEout HD is no exception. The tracks here work perfectly in line with both the visuals and overall racing experience, blending into the background just enough to not be overbearing, but remaining noticeable enough to help put icing on the mood. There aren't too many sound effects in the game, but what's there is great, especially the audio cue of your engines kicking in when you hit the gas. Fantastic stuff.  One last thing to mention is the online play for the game. Featuring support for up to eight racers, the game is just about as smooth as can be online, at least from my experience. Really, aside from real people racing like idiots half the time, there's no noticeable difference in the mechanics between racing online and off. The Liverpool guys did a fantastic job getting this part working perfectly right. The online options aren't all that robust, but being able to race against live opponents over the Internet is awesome, especially considering how well it works.   Ride the snake. "

        "id": "348939555a485be30dab4a283bb70c97",
        "Content": "Tekken is a powerhouse in the 3D fighting game realm and in arcades the world over. The franchise has been adapted to myriad platforms, and is no stranger to both consoles and handhelds, ported to everything from the PlayStation to the Game Boy Advance. Now the series is making its debut on the Nintendo 3DS with Tekken 3D Prime Edition , the first 3D handheld iteration of the series.    Tekken 3D Prime Edition manages to get the basics right. The combat boasts the fluidity that the series has become known for, and the graphics are excellent. The fighting unfolds at a silky smooth clip regardless of whether or not you have 3D turned on. The fighter roster is also impressive, offering the full cast from Tekken 6. However, aside from the basics, Tekken 3D Prime feels pretty shallow, severely lacking in any modes outside of standard one-on-one fights. You won't find much in the way of unlockables here, a stark contrast to other games in the Tekken franchise.  Tekken 3D Prime Edition really nails the fast-paced, fluid action of the series, and it's as well done here as it is on consoles. The 3DS iteration of the series does a great job of capturing the speed and intensity of Tekken 6, along with gameplay elements like Tetsu Power (which beefs up your character's strength somewhat after they've taken a beating). The characters feel like they have in the past, and the 3DS makes very little compromises with the series' formula.  The 3DS's somewhat cramped button layout doesn't really lend itself to intense fighting gameplay, so the developers have opted to include a compromise by adding four buttons on the touchscreen for each character's more complex moves, similar to the system seen in other fighting games on the handheld.   Tekken 3D Prime Edition boasts the full roster from Tekken 6.  Tekken 3D Prime Edition also features the fully stacked roster from Tekken 6, offering roughly 40 fighters in total. The one key difference is that Tekken 3D features the younger version of Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken Tag Tournament 2) in place of the more traditional older version of the character, as in Tekken 6. The cast list is varied, representing a mix of classic characters and newcomers, each one boasting a balanced fighting style.  Unfortunately, when it comes to depth outside of the actual fighting, Tekken 3D Prime Edition comes up short. The modes are pretty much straightforward fighting modes that lack any real kind of story or even customizability elements.  The game's Quick Battle mode is your standard 10-enemy arcade style mode leading up to the credit sequence, while Special Survival is an endurance mode where you have to fight in a series of one-round battles in order to gain new cards (more on them in a second). Aside from that, there's really not much here as far as depth is concerned.   Tekken 3D's gameplay is smooth and fluid.  In lieu of being able to customize your character, you're instead given a card collection system. You'll earn cards and card points for completing the game's Special Survival and Quick Battle modes, which you can then turn around and trade with other players through the game's Streetpass function. There are several hundred cards that can be unlocked, each one showing a different static image from Tekken's past. The trading element of these cards adds a communal element to Tekken's standard fare of gameplay, but doesn't offer the same amount of depth that the currency and customization elements from other Tekken games. You can edit a few elements of your character, including your name and customize their outfit color, but other than that, the customization elements are basically not there.  The game moves along at a smooth 60 frames per second clip, even when displaying in 3D, which is an impressive feat on the 3DS. The character models are well animated, and boast a nice amount of detail. Overall, this is one of the better looking games available on the platform and a fine showcase of its 3D capabilities.

        "Content": "Occasionally, while playing Celeste, I\u2019d get light-headed because I\u2019d focus so hard on a sequence of jumps that demanded precise timing and perfect button presses that I\u2019d forget oxygen was a thing my body needed. Trying and failing and trying again, getting a little closer each time, I let the beautiful art and adaptive music of the titular Celeste Mountain - alongside the passionate, relatable story told there - completely whisk me away.  Despite appearing at first to be yet another retro pixel-art 2D platformer, Celeste is surprising in so many different ways. From the moment I took my first jump, I fell in love with the satisfying way its protagonist, Madeline, feels to control; soon after I fell just as hard for the charming world she inhabits. But Celeste also caught me off guard with a relevant and emotional story about the pressures of modern life. What\u2019s remarkable is that the story isn\u2019t told in the background or overlaid on top of the action with constant interruption, but seamlessly and thoughtfully blended into the level design using both subtle themes and overt conversations. That\u2019s especially astonishing in a genre not known as a vehicle for such delicate messages.   That\u2019s the bigger picture, but every corner of Celeste is overflowing with charm. Its handful of characters are delightful and expressive, and the world they live in is teeming with small details. Smartly written dialogue is accompanied by silly, synthesized gibberish voices and animated character portraits that strikingly clash with the otherwise-pixelated art style, giving each character a distinct personality of their own. Little touches - like Madeline\u2019s red hair turning blue when she\u2019s spent her dash charge and then back again when it\u2019s restored by touching the ground or touching a power-up, or that dash causing lanterns in the background to sway when she zips by them - make everything feel alive and dynamic.  But Celeste doesn\u2019t succeed on charm alone \u2013 it also nails the fundamentals of its genre. All of that character is wrapped around one of the most blissfully fluid, responsive, and fun platformers I\u2019ve played since Super Meat Boy. For more than 20 hours of gameplay, Celeste has surprised me with consistently creative and fun platforming challenges and secrets that found unexpected depth from its relatively simple mechanics.  Mountain Dashing  Celeste\u2019s controls are extremely simple, just three buttons and a joystick, D-pad, or arrow keys. You can jump, dash once through the air in one of eight directions, and cling to walls and climb up or down for a limited time, but the nuance in how you use these easy-to-learn moves is extremely deep. Subtle changes in how long you hold each button, the angle of your jump, or the timing of your next dash can vastly change where you end up. This can be as simple as holding jump to keep yourself in the air longer or as complex dashing just next to a wall then quickly jumping off of it with precise timing to get you significantly more height. Critically, these factors were firmly in my own control and felt like skills that could be mastered.  Each success and failure was always my own \u2013 which is good because the failures do come often, and if even a fraction of them felt unfair it would\u2019ve been massively frustrating. Hazards such as spikes and traps scattered around each level will kill you with a single touch, and Celeste sadistically tracks every single death on a level-by-level basis - though it dismisses any worries you might have about how quickly that number rises, and actually encourages you to do your best along the way. Respawning is just as quick dying, with barely enough time for a Mega Man-like sparkle to signify your death, and the checkpoints are smartly placed to be forgiving while still making you prove you can complete the challenge in front of you.  Celeste has one of the best game soundtracks I\u2019ve heard in years. \u201c  Each of the eight chapters \u2013 a linear series of rooms that range in size from a single screen to a large side-scrolling area \u2013 have their own style, music, and a few unique platforming mechanics to interact with. The first takes place in a ruined city near the foot of the mountain and has platforms that speed along a track when you touch them (allowing you to launch yourself with a properly timed jump), while a later chapter is set closer to the peak, where winds will push you around and affect your speed and momentum. Every chapter feels distinct and different, which keeps Celeste from ever feeling stale.  The music and sound effects, in particular, deserve special mention here for the amazing amount of life they add to each location. Simply put, Celeste has one of the best game soundtracks I\u2019ve heard in years. It shifts with each screen, different instruments and variations fading in and out as the pace and intensity of the scene changes. The music pushed me along and slowed me down in harmony with the level design itself, and its connection to both the platforming and the story helped me connect more deeply with both Madeline and Celeste Mountain.  B-Side Myself  Unlike many other 2D platformers, there is a refreshing element of exploration to the layout of each chapter in Celeste. You can rush straight from start to finish if you\u2019d like, but destructible blocks and false walls often hide secret screens and diverging paths - and it\u2019s not uncommon to find secret areas hidden inside of other secret areas. It\u2019s not always easy to distinguish what\u2019s a secret path and what\u2019s just a dead end, which was initially a little frustrating, but there was usually some tell I could eventually learn to recognize - and the particularly well-disguised ones made going back to completed chapters to hunt for anything I\u2019d missed more exciting.   The most obvious reason to go looking for secret doors is the floating strawberries scattered throughout Celeste. Collecting them is completely optional, and many are hidden in dead-end screens that you could completely skipped, but trying to grab them provides some of the best platforming challenges available. Oftentimes, jumping from one side of a screen to the other can be relatively straightforward, but doing so while grabbing that screen\u2019s strawberry along the way takes much more finesse. Celeste also throws a bone to the completionists among us here, because after you\u2019ve beaten a chapter once you can pause to see a dotted line representing which strawberries you\u2019ve found and which you\u2019ve missed laid out in their rough order within that level, and you\u2019re able to restart at set checkpoints further into the chapter to access them without too much hassle.  The B-Sides are where the real challenge lies. \u201c But strawberries aren\u2019t the only collectible to grab. Every chapter also has a hidden B-Side cassette tape (developer Matt Makes Games playfully dates itself here) that, when found, unlocks a significantly harder, alternate version of that chapter with wonderfully remixed music. While the original chapters are generally difficult but doable enough that they come off as an excellently balanced base experience, the B-Sides are where the real challenge lies. It takes whatever mechanic that chapter introduced and pushes it to its limit, asking you for more creative problem solving with each screen, and then more precise button presses once you\u2019ve figured it out.  Beyond the B-Sides, there are even more secrets to find in Celeste. The hardest of these tested every part of the skills it had taught me: they required a careful eye to find clues about the path leading to them, were challenging to reach once I found them, and some even presented creative riddles that took me days of thinking on to finally crack. On top of the six to eight hours it took to beat the normal levels, I spent nearly another 20 finding collectibles and completing its brutally fun B-Sides - one of which took almost three hours and 1,400 deaths to complete, but had me literally jumping out of my chair with joy at multiple points. So it\u2019s remarkable that even after roughly 24 hours of playtime, Celeste still has so much more to offer.  Celeste Screenshots 13 Images  And through all this variation and excitement, the basics of movement don\u2019t ever really change. Similar to the brilliant Super Mario Odyssey\u2019s focus on Cappy, every part of Celeste\u2019s design revolves around Madeline\u2019s dash. It\u2019s the anchor for everything else, and each chapter plays with it in exciting and surprising ways. My favorite of these were the special diamonds (and some other level-specific mechanics) that can refresh your dash mid-air, creating ultra-satisfying sequences where you barely ever touch the ground.  Some of Celeste\u2019s harder levels make its inputs feel like a fighting game, even without any combat. \u201c  Sometimes your dash will move pieces of the world around you, making me think harder about the exact spot and angle I needed to use it. Celeste also plays around with momentum, letting you do things like use those moving platforms to launch yourself to otherwise unreachable spots. Without spoiling anything, some of the later levels also play around both with empowering your dash ability and severely limiting it, which continues to provide unique and amusing challenges without ever straying from that elegantly simple three-button core.  A few chapters put your knowledge of their unique mechanics to the test with \u201cboss fight\u201d style final sequences that turn up the pressure and force you to think and act quicker. There isn\u2019t really any combat in Celeste, but these sequences still manage to be intense and frantic, and a great way to put a different kind of spin on its level design. They also tie Celeste\u2019s story more directly into its platforming, with the emotion behind these sequences ratcheting up the pressure just as much as the mechanics themselves.  Some of Celeste\u2019s harder levels occasionally make it feel like a fighting game as well, asking you to move the stick in precise directions with tight timing. Dash up-right into a special orb that refreshes the dash, then swing the stick down-right before it spits you out in that direction, followed by quickly dashing right into a diamond and then again into another orb. Quick input chains like this can be forgiving early in Celeste, but demand perfection later. I love how high that makes the skill cap for precision movement (and I can\u2019t wait to see my best times destroyed by speedrunners) but it can also sometimes make the absolute peak of Celeste\u2019s hardest levels feel pretty punishing.   That said, I haven\u2019t found one I couldn\u2019t eventually beat with enough practice. Every time I died I could feel myself refining my strategy just a little bit. I would slowly dial in the angle of a jump or the timing of a pause, all the while getting more consistent at whatever parts came before that tricky bit. I\u2019d occasionally have a breakthrough in those tough spots as well, fundamentally rethinking how I was coming at a jump and making it much easier as a result, proving that Celeste\u2019s platforming requires smart thinking along with quick control. It makes beating these levels feel truly earned and immensely gratifying.  This is the type of game where you get better through doing and expanding your knowledge of the possibilities, not by powering up your character or getting new abilities. Growing and improving felt natural because Celeste is simple enough that it barely has to teach you its controls, but is still nuanced and complex in how you use them. After I had tackled a few of the B-Sides, going back to earlier chapters put that growth into clear perspective. They almost felt trivial compared to the new challenges I had faced in the meantime, and it reminded me how achievable completing Celeste\u2019s story chapters really are amid the high skill cap of its end-game - which is great, because it\u2019s worth playing even for those uninterested in pushing themselves further.  Jumping Simulator  Celeste\u2019s story starts out cute, with quirky characters and a clear goal for Madeline: climb to the peak of Celeste Mountain. Even though its garbled dialogue voices are a bit silly at first, their changing pitch and intonation (and the shifting portraits that come along with those voices) make each character extremely emotive and relatable. The characters Madeline meets along the way are lovable and funny; and while all of that sets Celeste up to be quite light-hearted, its story actually tackles some very real and important subjects.   Hidden under this challenging platformer\u2019s adorable exterior is a game about depression and anxiety. It\u2019s a hauntingly modern tale about being anxious and unhappy and never really knowing why, feeling like you just want to run away from how the world makes you feel. In this case, running away from social media and work and all the mistakes you\u2019ve made takes the form of climbing a mountain, but really it\u2019s just about doing anything crazy enough that it might shake you out of the rut you\u2019re in.  Celeste blends its story beautifully into the arcade-y game that houses it, making me feel for its characters without ever forcing me to. \u201c  It\u2019s a feeling that hit close to home for me at multiple points throughout Celeste, and one I\u2019m willing to bet many others will relate to as well. But Madeline\u2019s story isn\u2019t all about running: it\u2019s also about standing your ground in the face of the parts of yourself that scare you, and how learning to understand those parts is the only way to stop them from controlling you. None of these messages felt heavy-handed, and it\u2019s all conveyed through the lens of a world full of magic and adventure, but its core message is very down to Earth.  There aren\u2019t many games out there that feature two characters having a candid discussion about what depression feels like, or that depict a panic attack as tentacles attacking your character. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting that from a pixelated platformer where you collect flying strawberries and can magically dash through the air, but Celeste blends its story beautifully into the arcade-y game that houses it, making me feel for its characters without ever forcing me to.  As I read it, one of its chapters is a veiled metaphor for being in a bad or abusive relationship, while another is an allegory for how people can be consumed and trapped by social media. Maybe I'm reading too much into these levels, because those themes are thankfully never thrown directly in your face, but my interpretations of them were relatable and real either way.   Even though the story feels like a core part of Celeste, much of the heavier dialogue can be skipped past and ignored if you choose, and there\u2019s an option to skip every cutscene entirely. That means people who just want the white-knuckle platforming Celeste offers with none of the emotional baggage can easily have it that way. Alternatively, an Assist Mode can be turned on to make that platforming significantly easier, allowing you to do things like play in slow motion or gain more climbing stamina, so people who want to experience the story but can\u2019t make it up the mountain on their own will have a chance to do so as well.  That said, the way Celeste balances these two parts of itself by default is flawless. I cared deeply about Madeline\u2019s struggle and empathized with her in a way I wasn\u2019t expecting. That emotional struggle ties beautifully into some of Celeste\u2019s better platforming sequences as well, occasionally pushing the pace of the level into a frantic rush that made my heart race along with Madeline\u2019s - that speed and emotion being stoked by the soundtrack behind it.  The strength of Celeste\u2019s story and the honesty with which it tells it transforms this game from simply being one of the best platformers I\u2019ve played this decade into one of the most important ones as well. It effortlessly sneaks hard conversations about emotional and psychological health - important conversations that games don\u2019t often have - into a game that\u2019s still a phenomenal amount of fun without them."

        "Subtitle": "This 32-bit platformer just needs to fade away.",
        "Content": "At the dawn of the 32-bit generation, when games were making the transition between 2D and 3D, developers were struggling to get their mitt around new design philosophies and new technologies. An off-shoot of the platformer genre was formed during this period -- the 2.5D platformer. Pandemonium is a classic specimen of the 2.5D side-scroller. But as it arrives on the iPhone, we truly see that it is a game out of time. It is slow, it is clunky, and it has lost almost all of its mid-nineties charm. What we're left with is a collection of mechanics.  Pandemonium tells the story of Nikki and Fargus, friends that have accidentally unleashed a huge monster on the land and must clean up their mess. Each hero has their own special moves and attacks, such as Nikki's projectile attacks and Fargus' apparently lethal cartwheels.  You simply run from left to right, winding through some very colorful stages set in this fantasy kingdom. As you move along the linear path, the perspective changes to give the impression of 3D. The camera swings around, rises, and falls to offer a sense of depth where none actually exists. Pandemonium is a point A to point B adventure. A simple exercise in collecting items, bouncing on bad guys, and making precision jumps with a control scheme that is not remotely precise. And perhaps it is this last point that really slams the door on Pandemonium. The virtual controls for this game are competent, but not nearly as responsive as they need to be for the on-screen action. So many jumps are failed because the game just does not react in time. So many of Nikki's shots miss because she fires them a second too late.   Clean and colorful... but it's just not fun anymore.  But even if the controls worked perfectly, I'd still have a difficult time recommending Pandemonium. It's just not fun anymore. There are so many good platformers both old and new that there are no excuses to accept a mediocre one anymore. The level design in Pandemonium just isn't exciting. I think I enjoyed the opening cinema more than playing the game itself.   Pandemonium was reviewed with version 2.1.4.  ",

Super Monkey Ball and I were inseparable back in the GameCube days, but we grew apart when the series traded in its perfect blend of devilish challenges and finely-tuned physics for bland level design and imprecise motion controls aimed at a more casual audience \u2013 so you can imagine my apathy when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble\u2019s initial announcement focused so heavily on the uncontrolled chaos of its 16-player online battles. But I\u2019ve never been happier to be wrong, as tucked away inside Banana Rumble is the greatest set of traditional Super Monkey Ball levels the series has seen since the GameCube originals, backed up by tight mechanics that give me the complete control I needed to overcome its demanding late-game obstacles. Monkey Ball is finally back, and now all I want to do is roll. Banana Rumble\u2019s impressive set of 200 courses is divided into 20 cartoony worlds containing 10 stages apiece. In classic Monkey Ball fashion, the setup is delightfully simple: You have 60 seconds to roll your monkey from the start to the goal, but the hurdles between those points change radically across the adventure. The opening stages aren\u2019t too challenging, smartly acquainting you with Banana Rumble\u2019s mechanics so you\u2019re ready to go when it does turn up the heat. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Screenshots 6 Images IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! \ud83d\udca1 Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask As a certified Super Monkey Ball 2 master, I had no trouble with the first 80 levels or so. But they\u2019re still a joy to roll through, as I had to deal with curves, ramps, rails, switches, and bumps reminiscent of the level design seen in the excellent Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2. Plus, speedrunning is a classic element of the originals, and it was a ton of fun to see how rapidly I could blast through levels that don\u2019t demand too much precision, like stages where you can slam dunk into the goal with a perfect launch right from the start if you know what you\u2019re doing. I realized pretty quickly that Banana Rumble was a return to form for the series, and I had the best time rolling through the early levels while bopping to the wonderful GameCube-inspired soundtrack. That breezy feeling didn\u2019t last long, though, as Banana Rumble does not hold back in its second half. The 10 EX worlds unlocked after completing the main story delivered on all the Monkey Ball challenge I\u2019ve been begging for the series to bring back. Suddenly, I was dealing with grueling stages that truly tested my monkey mettle, from crazy rotating contraptions to invisible tilting seesaws to the narrowest of walkways you have to carefully tiptoe across, Banana Rumble is constantly introducing new challenges and smart twists on old ones. Some of the final levels took me dozens of attempts, and there\u2019s nothing quite like the feeling when my main monkey AiAi finally breaks through that one elusive goal. In fact, I\u2019ve been so engrossed in completing every stage Banana Rumble has to offer that one night I couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get up to turn the lights on after it got dark outside, so I was sitting in complete darkness rolling my monkey around until well past midnight. Totally worth it.

While it may look like you are directly moving your orb through each course, Super Monkey Ball is actually about controlling the stage, not the monkey. At its best, the control stick is aligned 1:1 with the angle of the stage, giving you pinpoint-precise command over how the terrain tilts \u2013 and in turn, how your monkey rolls through it. 2021\u2019s Banana Mania (which remade all the levels found in Super Monkey Ball 1, 2, and Deluxe ) should have been a home run as it returned to the best stages in series history, but the controls were so sluggish and imprecise that it made them overly frustrating at best and borderline unplayable at worst. Exact controls are a necessity for the toughest levels, and Banana Rumble handles so well that whenever I fell off the stage it almost always felt like my fault, which inspired me to improve on the next run. Banana Rumble even offers extensive control options for both the stage and the camera, so I cranked every possible setting to the max and found that gave me the expert level of control I was seeking. The physics aren\u2019t entirely perfect \u2013 sometimes I didn\u2019t get the level of bounce I expected when dropping from a high ledge \u2013 but this is still easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two. This is easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two. \u201c Banana Rumble has also finally ditched the series poorly-implemented jumping mechanic (if I\u2019m tilting the stage and my monkey is trapped in a ball, why would they be able to jump?) in favor of an exciting new spin dash, which takes a page from Sonic the Hedgehog and lets you charge up and release a quick burst of speed. Whereas the jump never amounted to more than a gimmick in past games, the spin dash is a genius evolution of Monkey Ball\u2019s core mechanics. It\u2019s only mandatory in a handful of levels, but almost every single stage has some sort of shortcut or exploit that\u2019s only possible to pull off thanks to this new ability. A properly-aimed spin dash can catapult your poor monkey across the map in the blink of an eye, and it\u2019s a speedrunner\u2019s dream to uncover all the ways to take advantage of this smart addition. Banana Rumble rewards players who understand the mechanics and level design with optional routes hiding in plain sight that require expert skill to reach, and it adds a lot of replay value to an already packed adventure. Who is your go-to Super Monkey Ball character? AiAi MeeMee Baby GonGon Someone else! Answer See Results Banana Split-Screen Multiplayer has been welcomed back to the main game, which was shockingly missing from the last two entries. You can tackle all 200 stages with up to three other players in split-screen local multiplayer or online co-op. Playing with others online is pretty seamless \u2013 I played through the entire campaign online with a friend and we never had a disconnect. Banana Rumble also runs at a very smooth 60 FPS when playing alone on Nintendo Switch, and it maintains that level of performance when you add online play into the mix. The frame rate takes a slight hit in split-screen, but not to the point where it feels unplayable. Playing with others turns Banana Rumble into a surprisingly strategic cooperative experience. Everyone begins the stage at the same time, and only one player has to complete it in order for the group to move on. This also makes each level\u2019s optional missions easier to complete: Every stage tasks you with collecting a certain number of bananas, completing it in under a certain number of seconds, and finding the hidden golden banana which often requires a high-level technique to snag. Assigning one person to get to the goal as fast as possible while the rest seek out bananas adds a fun layer of planning to the whole experience. I even had fun tackling levels online with random players, as I helped some Monkey Ball rookies clear some easier worlds and worked with others to grab some tricky golden bananas in later stages, using encouraging emotes and phrases to cheer my teammates on. I only wish Banana Rumble also included a more traditional Challenge Mode where you take turns and work through all of the levels individually at your own pace. One issue with online multiplayer is that it kicks all of you out of a party after you complete a world, so I would have to share a new lobby code with my friend every single time we wanted to keep playing. Additionally, when working through the adventure mode online, Banana Rumble doesn\u2019t show you the story cutscenes, meaning if you want to know what\u2019s going on with AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, and their new friend Palette, you\u2019ll have to either play locally or catch up on all the cutscenes in the gallery after the fact. I don\u2019t play Monkey Ball for the story \u2013 and the story here is extremely basic and barebones anyways \u2013 so I actually preferred not seeing the cutscenes so we could get straight to the stages, but it does feel like a strange omission. Banana Rumble\u2019s biggest monkey\u2019s paw wish is its aforementioned battle mode. Longtime Super Monkey Ball fans know how iconic legacy party games like Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are, but there\u2019s nothing here that held my attention for more than a couple minutes. The five modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired, with so few maps in rotation that I felt like I\u2019d seen everything they had to offer after less than an hour. There\u2019s generic racing, banana gathering, and bomb passing that feel like cheap knockoffs of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe \u2019s battle mode. I\u2019m guessing others feel the same way, as it took me several minutes to find a match with a full 16 players just a few days after launch. The performance also takes a serious hit in battle mode, reducing the smooth 60 FPS of the adventure mode to a choppy slideshow at times. Local multiplayer comes with its own set of limitations, as you can\u2019t play battle mode online with two people on the same system, and three-to-four player battles aren\u2019t even an option locally. The five battle modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired. \u201c But even if you completely ignore Banana Rumble\u2019s undercooked battle mode, there\u2019s still so much to do here. I\u2019ve already completed all 200 stages, but I\u2019m nowhere close to finishing all of the stage missions \u2013 some of which I\u2019m still scratching my head at as I try to figure out how I\u2019m supposed to grab dozens of bananas and make it to the goal in time. There are hundreds of cosmetic items to buy with in-game points to style your monkey, too. I\u2019m a simple man, so I bought AiAi\u2019s classic orange T-shirt from the original games and called it good, but it\u2019s cool how many outfits and accessories are available for Banana Rumble\u2019s 12 playable characters (or more, if you get the optional SEGA Pass that adds Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to the mix)."

        "Content": "The designers of N.O.V.A ., Gameloft's new first-person shooter for iPhone, have been playing a lot of Halo. And it's obvious that when they took a break, it was only to play Dead Space. But while its derivative nature is on full display in every pixel of N.O.V.A ., so is something else: a slam-bang action game that draws a new line in the sand and challenges all else to top it. When you get your thumbs on N.O.V.A.'s exemplary controls, great scenarios, and excellent polish you will immediately understand why it scored our award for the best iPhone action game of 2009.  You are Kal Wardin, a former soldier drafted back into service to protect Earth from the fury of the alien xenos. A vanished space station has reappeared outside of Earth's orbit and it threatens the orbital platforms humanity has been forced to live on following the collapse of our planet's environment. You must explore this station to find out what happened, which in turn leads you on a chase across the galaxy that invariably ends up with you kicking in xeno teeth on their own turf.  Wardin has plenty of firepower to choose from, all standard-issue shooter fare like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Ammo is everywhere, but sometimes you must hack open a crate via a short puzzle to score the good stuff. In addition to normal weapons, Wardin also has special skills like the ability to freeze an enemy for just a few moments via an energy attack. The trade off, though, is shield strength. This tactic adds an enormous amount of strategy to N.O.V.A. as you really do need those shields so you aren't repeatedly staring at the sky through a blood-spattered visor. However, when you are facing down four or five xenos (all with clever AI that encourages group rushes, seeking cover, etc.), putting one on ice for just a few seconds is enormously helpful crowd control.  N.O.V.A.'s controls are very similar to Gameloft's summer shooter, Modern Combat: Sandstorm. Move via a responsive virtual stick, look by dragging a finger around the screen, and fire with a dedicated button. Things have been tightened up, such as movement sensitivity. The aim-assist feature is also quite useful when you first start playing N.O.V.A., as it snaps the crosshairs to the enemy you are looking at but without over-compensating. It's just a little nudge. It does not play the game for you but when you are trying to cross an open field with a dozen xenos on a rampage, getting a little \"snap\" is sometimes the difference between life and restarting from the last checkpoint.   Right between the eyes.  N.O.V.A. is a run-and-gun first-person shooter at heart, but it uses big scripted moments and set pieces to create some high drama across 13 stages, such as dodging small meteors as you race across a space station exterior. However, my absolute favorite event in N.O.V.A. is small. It's when a brutish xeno gets close enough to grab you. You are hoisted into the air and have limited mobility. Able only to reach your pistol, you must shoot the monster in the face repeatedly for it to drop you. Of course, if you haven't reloaded your pistol recently, you may find yourself in real trouble. It's a great intimate moment in contrast to the large-scale mayhem you are otherwise engaged in.   If there is any shortcoming in the single-player game, it is the aforementioned lack of originality. N.O.V.A. is essentially Gameloft's Halo with touches of a handful of other shooters thrown in just for good measure, such as the ship exterior sequences of Dead Space. With such a great control system and smart pacing, it is too bad Gameloft did not carve out something with a little more originality. That said, ask yourself if you currently know of an iPhone shooter other than N.O.V.A. that fills that gaping Halo-shaped void on the App Store?   Gameloft also infuses N.O.V.A. with four-player multiplayer. You can either challenge local players or wade online via the Internet (no over-the-air play). I have yet to suffer a dropped game, although I have seen a bit of chug and pop here and there. There are five maps, each taken from an environment in the single-player game. I enjoyed multiplayer quite a bit but do wish Gameloft had added some sort of character progression or customization. All you can do is switch out armor color. Where is my medal for 20 headshots? A cool helmet that players logging a certain number of matches get to wear?  N.O.V.A. is Gameloft's most attractive game yet without question. Running on a third-gen iPod Touch or iPhone 3G S, the game not only runs exceedingly smooth with no framerate hiccups, but does so with multiple enemies on-screen and lots of effects. On a regular iPhone, I only noticed the occasional pullback with an effect or slowdown --nothing that would upset the applecart.   N.O.V.A. was reviewed with version 1.1.0.  "

The best games dunk your head into the waters of their worlds, and don't bring you up to breathe until the credits roll. But when some elements don't work, that suspension shatters and screams: it's just a game. Alice: Madness Returns is an uneven journey of immersion that hits a lot of high points but constantly shows off its cracks.    At its heart, Alice: Madness returns combines the weapon-based fighting of third-person action games with more conventional platforming. Combat is fluid \u2013 it animates smoothly, it's responsive, and Alice flows from one move to the next without stutter or stop. Dodging is fast, adding to the feel of Alice as a lethal character. The variety of weapons encourages an organic construction of combos, based on each item's strengths. Knocking over an armored enemy with the Hobby Horse, slashing it open with the Vorpal Blade, and then finishing them with the Pepper Grinder is a seamless barrage. Alice's acrobatics are also a lot of fun to apply. Navigating Wonderland via jumps (and double-jumps and triple-jumps), floating, and shrinking makes things more interesting, and viewing secret messages using Shrink Sense to find hidden paths and items adds to Alice: Madness Returns' exploratory experience.  Alice: Madness Returns takes bits and pieces from Lewis Carroll's original vision and filters them through a gritty, new light to great effect. Set after the events of American McGee's Alice, Madness Returns finds Alice outside the insane asylum. But her madness hasn't been cured, and she sets out to discover exactly who, or what, started the fire that killed her entire family, and triggered her insanity. Alice: Madness Returns jumps between an eerie London and the ruined depths of Wonderland, with a story full of interesting riddles and surprising reveals. Characters from the original American McGee's Alice return, and are a great addition \u2013 especially when their motives have changed and fit into American McGee's world in new ways.   Speak softly and carry a big horse head.  Alice: Madness Returns' Wonderland is enormous, beautiful, and imaginative. During its best moments, Alice: Madness Returns is a memorable portrait of a fantastical world. Soaring through the clouds of the Cardbridge is inspired, and walking the streets of a gloomy London is an excellent counterpoint to the brighter light of Wonderland. The two-dimensional, newsprint-style cut-scenes between chapters are stylish and interesting.  Wonderland isn't all scenic magic. While the majority of Alice: Madness Returns is set amidst imaginative beauty, exploring Wonderland also reveals graphical inconsistencies. With ugly textures coating the Mad Hatter's domain, or the pixilated blue explosions of pig snouts and other graphic weirdness, Madness Returns has a hidden backside of blocky blandness.  In comparison to the bizarre and vibrant world of Wonderland, Alice: Madness Returns' performances are somewhat mundane. Supporting characters help flesh out Wonderland with interesting performances, but Alice barely reacts to the ups and downs of the dramatic arc. The music grows tiresome during longer sections, but sets an appropriately haunting tone otherwise.   The combat's consistently fluid.  The cracks in Alice: Madness Returns' immersion show most in its exploration, though. Invisible walls block the flow of exploration. Fallen logs can't be traversed, despite a map that continues on their other side. What's worse, though Alice can shrink to a size where she should fit into certain areas, she won't \u2013 the level won't let her. This is frustrating, an archaic reminder that Alice: Madness Returns is just a game.  In small chunks these elements remain fun, but set against lengthy gameplay sessions they grow repetitive. As Alice: Madness Returns' bizarre mystery unfolded, the limits of the experience showed themselves. There are dozens of levers to pull, countless slides to jump on, and a plethora of similar battles to conquer. But Alice: Madness Returns is content to step on its own foot. "

        "Content": "There's something attractive about the jigsaw puzzle. Spilling the pieces out on the coffee table and slowly building it back into a picture is a time-honored tradition that people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy. Yet, no matter how well you package the game -- and Puzzle Arcade is done quite well -- it just isn't that much fun to put a jigsaw puzzle together by using a controller. The \"hands on\" feeling of accomplishment you get from completing a puzzle just isn't there.  Publisher Eidos and developer Say Design did an excellent job sprucing up a mundane idea by providing just about every feature you could ask for. You can change the shape of the pieces, decide how many pieces you want in a puzzle (crank it up to over a thousand if you want to be overwhelmed or drop it down to just over a dozen for a quick match). Puzzle progress can be saved part of the way through to continue later so you're free to start a puzzle now and finish it in a few weeks without any fear of losing a piece.   Puzzle Arcade has a nice set of features. The idea of putting a puzzle together might seem like a pretty straightforward process, but that didn't stop Say Design from tossing in a nice variety of modes. If you hate sorting through pieces and flipping them over to find the right one, you can turn on turbo mode and have that done for you. There are challenges, such as one where pieces keep flipping back upside down or another where other \"players\" keep moving pieces around while you try to put them together, to spice things up. You can even do dynamic puzzles where the picture changes as you work on it or fractal puzzles where you work on one section at a time (loosely shaped like a larger puzzle piece which is then fit into the overall puzzle).  I had no problems with the controls either, an aspect of Puzzle Arcade that is both fluid and easy to grasp. The various puzzle pieces begin in a state of disarray, but picking up, flipping and rotating each piece to snap together is a cinch. On the tougher puzzles, you can zoom in and even pick pieces to set aside on a \"work bench\" to separate them from the rest of the jumbled mess. If you're used to working together to complete the puzzle, this release won't disappoint there either. Up to four players can work together either locally on one screen or over Xbox Live.  The only real issue I had with the way the game is constructed lies in the pictures used for the puzzles. There is one piece of Tomb Radar artwork featuring Lara Croft, but the rest are pretty generic. More Eidos videogame art or screenshots would have been great. Heck, just more interesting puzzle pictures of any sort would have been nice. This is partially remedied through the Xbox Live Vision Camera support. If you have the camera, you can snap a photo of anything you want and then use that as the basis for your puzzle. These pictures can't be saved or shared, though.   This isn't as fun as the real thing. A smaller gripe comes with the background you work on. For some reason Say Design chose a swirling graphic that is near identical to the PlayStation 3 dashboard. You can turn the animation off but can't work on anything blank such as a coffee table.  In the end, the issues with the way the game was put together are trivial. Puzzle Arcade has a great presentation with smooth controls and a nice set of options. That can't cover up the fact that it's a jigsaw puzzle videogame. I like jigsaw puzzles as much as the next person, but I couldn't stay excited about clicking the pieces together in videogame form for long enough to justify an 800 Microsoft point (US $10) price tag. There's something rewarding about working through a jigsaw puzzle and then leaving your handiwork on display for a few days or weeks that Puzzle Arcade just can't replicate, try though it may.",

With a starting price of $799 for the 64GB model, the iPhone 12 is a bit more expensive than last year\u2019s iPhone 11, leaving room for the iPhone 12 Mini to fit in at the $699 price point (though it\u2019s $729 unlocked). A few upgrades to the iPhone 12 do help justify the increased price and it practically steals the show from the iPhone 12 Pro , but let's see if the new phone can earn its keep. iPhone 12 Review 14 Images  Design and Features The iPhone 12 will look fairly familiar with a design that\u2019s largely reminiscent of last year\u2019s model. Apple has changed the aluminum frame of the phone, giving it a flat edge that harkens back to the iPhone 4 . The phone feels wide in my hand, a bit wider than the Samsung Galaxy S20 or Sony Xperia V II, but the boxy edges make for a more secure grip than I expected. Apple has actually managed to trim down the size of the iPhone 12 from its predecessor. It narrowed the bezels around the display slightly and used that extra space to shrink the chassis. The screen remains 6.1 inches diagonally, but Apple has packed in the Super Retina XDR display, which increases the resolution to 2,532 x 1,170 and uses OLED technology, making for a considerable upgrade that helps merit the price hike. Which phone platform are you on? iOS Android Harmony OS (Huawei) Windows Phone holdout Symbian all day Answer See Results The new screen looks delicious, with more than enough brightness for sunny days and rich colors. But, anyone coming from an iPhone 11 Pro won\u2019t find much different. Regrettably, the iPhone 12 continues to feature the prominent notch at the top of the screen. It\u2019s still a bit of an eyesore, as I\u2019ve found it much harder to overlook than the small camera cutouts found on many competing Android phones . I find the amount of information I\u2019m able to get squeezed in at either side of the notch isn\u2019t worth much. While many smartphone manufacturers have gone through several iterations of their display cutout, it\u2019s disappointing to see Apple stuck with the same design it introduced three generations ago with the iPhone X . On the plus side, the sensors in that notch are quick to recognize my face, even in dark conditions.  Some of Apple\u2019s design upgrades aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye. For one, the new line of phones all feature 5G connectivity. In major metropolitan areas, this can be a considerable perk. For most, it won\u2019t mean much. Even with the prevalence of 5G in Chicago, I rarely find myself in an area that offers speeds above those I can get with 4G LTE. Still, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have on a phone that for many customers may last several years, especially as 5G coverage continues to roll out across the country. Another hidden change are the materials. The display is now covered in \u201cCeramic Shield,\u201d which Apple claims is tougher than any smartphone glass. I haven\u2019t dropped the phone onto the ground, but other reviewers have tested it and found it more robust than at least the previous iPhone glass. The back glass doesn\u2019t get this upgrade though. Hiding inside the iPhone 12 is a MagSafe magnetic ring. There\u2019s little I can say about this, as all it did in my review was detect when I had put a plastic case on. Additional accessories and wireless chargers will make better use of this feature though, allowing accessories to easily snap into place. On their own, though, the magnets don\u2019t change much about the phone in general use. They are relatively weak and won\u2019t let you stick your phone to every metal surface in your home.  There are two things Apple has done (or not done) that are hard to forgive. With 64GB of base storage, there\u2019s not a lot of room. I\u2019ve only used my review unit for a couple weeks and I\u2019m already using 25.9GB of space. Some 4K videos, a few large games, some downloaded Netflix movies, and a large photo collection, and I\u2019d be in real trouble at 64GB. It\u2019s only an extra $50 to move up to 128GB, and it\u2019s probably worth it, but that feels like a high price when I can get a 64GB microSD card for $9. The second thing Apple did was remove the charging brick from the box. That much is forgivable, but Apple also switched from a Lightning-to-USB-A cable to cable that terminates in a USB-C connection. So, while you can plug the iPhone 12 into any of your old cables, you can plug the new cable into exactly none of your old iPhone charging bricks. Either the new cable is kind of useless or all the old charging bricks are kind of useless. As an environmental effort, Apple\u2019s move feels ill-conceived. (Never mind the push toward wireless charging with MagSafe, a power delivery method that will use more energy to charge your phone than a wire would).   Software The iPhone 12 ships with iOS 14. Having not used Apple\u2019s mobile operating system in a long time, I was curious to see how well I could adjust. iOS 14 proved fairly easy to adapt to coming from using Android phones. Swipe navigation makes sense and works comparable to Android\u2019s own implementation, and I found some familiarity in the Notification Center and utilities page. iOS 14 gets tedious with how particular it is about where on the screen I swipe from and how far I swipe. It makes one-handed navigation difficult. Availability of swipe navigation is also inconsistent, as some pages require use of a back button instead (which isn\u2019t always easy to find). Aside from this shortcoming, navigation is quick and fluid. Though Apple hasn\u2019t introduced a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate with the latest phones, I\u2019ve heard many of my fellow reviewers comment on Apple\u2019s notable fluidity even at 60Hz. I\u2019m inclined to agree that everything feels smooth, including scrolling, and is fairly responsive. Though I think some of that sense stems from something of a speed limit in iOS. Many times while trying to scroll up and down a page, the rate of scrolling felt much slower than I was aiming for.  iOS 14 has come with a number of new features and tweaks that aim to improve the overall experience. Those include an App Library, more compact UI elements (particularly Siri and ongoing calls), upgraded Widgets, and App Clips. The App Library is meant to offer a convenient place to look for all of your apps. Apple automatically groups apps into collections on the last page of the home screen. This is sensible in theory, but Apple\u2019s grouping isn\u2019t. In my case, Gmail and Google Voice show up in a box called \u201cProductivity and Finance.\u201d Meanwhile, all my other communication apps were in \u201cSocial.\u201d Chrome and Safari were in \u201cUtilities\u201d alongside Watch, Measure, and the App Store. Books, Pocket Casts, Tips, and Translate were maybe reasonably in \u201cInformation & Reading,\u201d but Weather felt like an odd inclusion. I love app folders and use them extensively on Android. Having a screen dedicated to them on iOS could be handy, but Apple\u2019s implementation is weak and lacks any way to re-organize apps or re-name folders \u2013 surprising, since the home screen allows those folder customizations.  The new widgets could also be good in theory. They can now provide more data, and they can be placed on the home screen. But, I\u2019ve found they don\u2019t take much advantage of the ability to offer more data. Most of the widgets I\u2019ve seen are little more than shortcuts to perform an action within an app, and they almost all take up more space than they need. My widget to play the newest release in Pocket Casts takes up the space of four apps on the home screen, but most of the space is blank. Another widget I have for App recommendations takes up eight slots to show eight apps, and once placed it simply blended in with the home screen, so it\u2019s no longer apparent that those app shortcuts are actually in a widget. These are all features that could prove handy with further revision, but coming from Android, I feel like this is a game of catch up and Apple has just started running. iOS 14 is still capable, and I\u2019ve found it less prone to odd behavior than Android, albeit not immune (one day the screen shifted its brightness levels so the max brightness was fairly dim and its minimum brightness was nearly black. A reboot sorted it out). App Clips are a feature that comes with iOS 14, and they sound promising, but I haven\u2019t been able to test them out. They offer a way to run a small portion of an app without having to download the whole thing. I could see this being useful in some of Apple\u2019s suggested use-cases, such as at retailers or restaurants, as having a full app for everywhere I go would quickly become a mess.   Gaming and performance The iPhone 12 shares the same Apple A14 Bionic chipset found across all four phones in the line. Apple has long managed impressive performance out of its chips, and there\u2019s no lack of muscle in this case. Whether I was scrolling a large page of animated GIFs or gaming, the iPhone 12 didn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down. The GIF scrolling was actually impressive, as I\u2019ve often seen this kind of task hit some devices hard, as loading in new GIFs while continuing to play loaded ones takes a toll. That said, compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 running in the Samsung Galaxy S20, I see more or less similar performance. Apple has long managed impressive performance out of its chips, and there\u2019s no lack of muscle in this case \u201c Gaming does set Apple apart though. I played through the opening portion of That Game Company\u2019s Sky, a game I like to use for phone reviews as it\u2019s perhaps one of the most visually impressive smartphone games I\u2019ve seen. The iPhone 12 managed to make it even more stunning. It was incredibly smooth through my testing, with the iPhone 12 never getting more than a bit warm. The game looked great in its battery-saver mode, and the phone easily ran it with 60fps performance mode and 30fps quality modes. I occasionally noticed frame rates dropping in the performance mode, but they generally stayed high. Still, it\u2019s not quite the \u201coff the charts frames per second\u201d for \u201cconsole-quality gaming\u201d that Apple suggested during its launch presentation. Even though the Galaxy S20 had an easy time running the game as well, in a side-by-side comparison, the game visuals on the iPhone in all modes appear sharper, with better anti-aliasing and clearer surface textures.  Only the iPhone\u2019s storage and memory seemed to be weak points. Sky launched and levels loaded quicker on the Galaxy S20. Switching from the same point in the game to the home screen, opening one app (HBO Max), and then switching right back to the game also required the iPhone to relaunch the game while the S20 was able to resume from where I\u2019d left off. Fortunately, Apple\u2019s small battery isn\u2019t as much of an issue. I am not a heavy phone user from day to day, but do regularly check notifications, scroll Twitter, take photos, and listen to podcasts. I averaged over two hours of daily screen time in my last week of testing. With that level of activity, I easily could make it through two full days, and I even made it through three just to see if I could. It even managed two days when I did more extreme testing, like a number of 4K video tests, a 45-minute-long video call, and about 40-minutes of Sky gameplay (which only drained about 14% of the battery). Every user will have their own experience, but I\u2019d feel confident in the iPhone 12 surviving a whole day even if I was using it far more regularly. iPhone 12 Image Samples 22 Images  Camera The cameras haven\u2019t fundamentally changed this time around. Apple has claimed improved low-light performance, perhaps thanks to a wider aperture on the main wide-angle sensor, and I\u2019ve seen it perform well in that department. I snapped one photo at night on a dark street trying to capture a crane in the distance while a neon sign was lit up, and the camera did an excellent job handling that shot, adding a lot of extra visibility to what was a much darker scene in actuality.  The iPhone 12 cameras also make great products with strong lighting, offering life-like colors that often were a very close match for what I was seeing with my own eyes. From the main sensor, the images are wonderfully crisp. The ultra-wide camera isn\u2019t nearly as good. In the same setting, it produces much noisier and softer images. In low light, it gets even worse. Even though the camera proves capable of handling slight hand movement during long exposures, a quality shot on the primary sensor loses much of that quality when taken with the ultra-wide instead.  The main sensor\u2019s performance in both high- and low-light scenarios is a knack that it carries over into scenes with both. It handles a high dynamic-range thoroughly well, even capable of capturing all the detail on my poorly lit desk, outside my window during the daytime, and on my computer screen in one shot \u2013 a scenario many cameras would struggle with.  As in photos, so too in video. Basically, the strengths of the main sensor and the weaknesses of the ultra-wide are echoed in video. The iPhone 12 can record in up to 4K at up to 60fps, though it can quickly toggle between 1080p and 4K, and 24, 30, and 60fps. It can also record HDR video with Dolby Vision encoding and a 10-bit color depth. This is perhaps what lets it record HDR footage that looks just as good as its HDR photography. The phone\u2019s stabilization makes for surprisingly smooth handheld video, even when I tried to be (or failed to be anything but) fairly amateurish with my hand movements. That said, the image shifts rather quickly as lighting in the shot changes, and that can make for some jarring footage even if the motion is smooth. This issue is slightly diminished when shooting in 4K/30 instead of 4K/60. That brings us to another issue: settings. The iPhone 12 cameras behave differently depending on their settings. In testing I discovered that I could transition from the ultra-wide camera to the main camera and back in a single recording, but not if I was recording in 4K60. No settings indicated this would happen, and 4K60 still allows zooming in and out, but it restricts it to underwhelming digital zoom on the sensor you start the recording with. That said, the transition when the recording switches sensors is so jarring, it\u2019s best avoided altogether (that goes for the Galaxy S20, too). I also noticed switching from 4K to HD video recording actually crops the image slightly, but this isn\u2019t so much a concern as it is an oddity.  All told, the main iPhone 12 camera is among the best I\u2019ve used, especially when it comes to point-and-shoot. I\u2019d rank it above the Galaxy S20 because of that phone\u2019s struggle to get the right things in focus, but perhaps not as highly as the Sony Xperia V II. It takes great photos and videos with little fuss on my part. The ultra-wide \u2013 not so much. It\u2019s too bad there\u2019s only one great sensor, as the many Android phones offering multiple decent sensors wins out in versatility. Aside from actual visual issues, the biggest fault of the iPhone 12 camera is that it\u2019s so capable of doing all the heavy lifting that Apple has left out most user control. Anyone who wants the least bit of control over white balance, shutter speed, ISO, or anything else will find the iPhone 12 camera app lacking. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an app for that, but those controls in the default apps could have made it easier to capture pictures of my roommate\u2019s cat rolling around or record a video around my living room without the white balance shifting several times during the shot. Some of the settings that actually are user-adjustable, like toggling HDR, are sadly buried in the Settings app rather than appearing within the camera app itself.  Spinning around to the front, the selfie camera offers up clean and clear images. Next to the Galaxy S20 selfie camera, the iPhone easily offered a more realistic photo with better detail and less noise. Meanwhile, other features like slo-mo and portrait mode may be nice to have, but don\u2019t offer compelling quality.  The portrait mode feels like someone who\u2019s good at Photoshop was in a hurry, and I would have expected my bald head to be fairly easy to separate from a background. The slow-mo is capable, shooting at up to 240fps, but it gets dim and grainy.  Purchasing guide The iPhone 12 is available from Apple for $799 with carrier activation ($829 unlocked) for the 64GB model. We\u2019d recommend jumping up to the 128GB for an extra $50, as 64GB would get tight quickly. At $849 ($879 unlocked), the iPhone 12 may feel a bit lacking in features next to the competition. The price for the extra storage even puts it closer to the $999 iPhone 12 Pro , which does expand functionality a little by adding an extra camera, even if the screen and processor are the same. But, of the Pro models, the $1099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is the better choice. Every IGN iPhone Review 19 Images The Samsung Galaxy S20 may have started at $999 , but it\u2019s not hard to find Samsung phones at a discount, and the versatility of the S20 gives it an edge. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S20 FE offers an even more value at $699 . Unless you really want the extra screen space, the iPhone 12 Mini is the more enticing entry into the iPhone 12 era. It comes in $100 cheaper at $699 for the 64GB model, and the only difference is size: It\u2019s much smaller and features a 5.4-inch display."

        "Content": "When we first got word that EA would be expanding its sports division to encompass Wii fully, we were psyched.  The company nailed Madden in the Wii's opening year, following it up with a slightly less polished version of gaming's greatest football franchise, but still one that is well worth the cash, and evidence of hard work and dedication from EA's Wii department. Surely Tiger, NBA, and FIFA would follow suit, right?  Right?  Wrong. NBA Live 08 for Wii is easily the weakest EA effort thus far on Nintendo's system, and that includes Madden, FIFA, Tiger, SSX, and even MySims; it's simply too thin.  From the game's preliminary boot it may seem as though NBA Live has everything a Wii-owning b-ball nut would want, but it's simply not true, as the game lacks dynasty mode, create-a-baller, or any actual resemblance of true-to-life basketball strategy whatsoever.  This may be a game \"anyone can play like a pro\" in, but if Wii isn't your first system, or if NBA Live isn't your premiere basketball experience you'll be hugely disappointed with what it has to offer.   NBA Live features the same EA Family Play modes as Madden and FIFA this year, allowing virtually anyone to pick up a controller and get a simplistic sports offering with knowing little to nothing about videogames at all.  In NBA Live Family Mode you'll worry only about shooting, passing, stealing, and blocking, each assigned to either vertical or horizontal waggle as the players move around the court automatically.  Unfortunately the game just isn't fun to play, as it's far too easy to sink shots, you feel disconnected from the game entirely, and the motion isn't always as responsive as you'd like.  Oftentimes we'd have enough time to post up for a shot, repeat the action again to try and bypass the wonky motion detection, and actually have enough time to holler at another IGN editor to witness the lack of jumpshot taken while we flick up and down repetitively.  Sure, most of the time the motion works just fine, and though it's extremely simple it's still pretty responsive, but when it glitches out, it does it with reckless abandon.  In a smart move by EA though, ramping up from Family Play to full control mode is a smooth transition; simply plug in the nunchuk and you're good to go.  As for options and game modes, NBA Live is playing shorthanded compared to the other versions.  Online is there, and from what we've played it's pretty decent overall as far as connection speed and lag goes, but you'll again only be playing single games with no online tournaments or added play modes.  Go into a lobby or join quick-play; simple as that.  Dynasty mode has been removed - something that even PS2 has - but the game is visually stronger when pitted side-by-side against the PS2 build, and runs in 16:9 and 480p.  Season mode is amazingly basic though, allowing for little more than trades and scheduled games.  Instead you've got Party Mode, which consists of two mini-game modes; the three-point competition, and slam dunk contest.  Both are extremely simple, using just a few Wii motions to shoot the long ball or pull off a variety of dunks in a active cinematic play mode - chose the dunk, do the motions, watch your player slam it home - but neither mini-games hold a candle to even a single Madden mini from 07/08.  It's just too thin.  A Wii-exclusive \"Challenge Mode\" has also been included this year, which basically takes a variety of superstars and puts them in classic game situations, having players complete challenges one-by-one as they rise the ranks of NBA history, but again it's amazingly basic.  Pick your challenge, play through it, rinse, and repeat.  It may not have a ton of different modes or depth, but even still that'd be fine of the core gameplay was on par with other EA efforts on Wii.  Unfortunately, it isn't, as NBA Live is full of odd graphical and gameplay glitches; it is entirely unbalanced, far too easy, and a shell of its former self. Motion control is spotty and unreliable, character animations lack the necessary in-betweens to give off a fluid, realistic look, and gameplay is a mess, often disregarding rules like pass-in time limits, lane times, backcourt violations, or the like.   With the game running in default settings we fired up our first full exhibition math with the Miami Heat, only to realize that Jason Williams was unconscious from three-point range; he simply couldn't miss.  Attributing it to his \"star\" ability we started passing through the starting line, shooting three after three while in single and double coverage; swish.  Finally we got to The Diesel himself, Shaquille O'Neal.  Remembering his keen ability to miss the backboard while shooting free throws, we posted Shaq up at the top of the arc, and nailed swish after swish with the big man from 24 feet out.  Apparently it's true:  With NBA Live 08 for Wii, anyone can play like a pro - even Shaq.  For the record, during that game the big man was more Kazaam than he was O-Neal, as he went on to shoot 18/22 from beyond the paint; an 82% accuracy rating.  The NBA Jam version of Shaq can't even post those numbers.  Of course when you crank up the difficulty levels the game starts to even out a bit, but even still it lacks the depth, solidarity in team control, and strategy that makes for a true game of basketball.  Instead, you've got an easy-to-play, dumbed down version of NBA Live; something that only b-ball newcomers will want to touch.  As far as presentation goes, the model detail is pretty strong, thought he game suffers from the aforementioned animation oddities and glitches that constantly come up.  The audio section is by far the game's strongest point, including some solid hip hop tracks - Toxic by Mark Ronson is a must-hear - and decent commentary during games.  It's a shame that the rest of the package lacks as much quality as Live's audio effort. "

        "Content": "Abzu creates one of the most relaxing, stress-free underwater experiences I\u2019ve ever played. By emphasizing freedom of movement over survival, it gave me all the time I needed to soak in its gorgeous art direction, marvel at its fluid controls, and listen to its epic orchestral score. During the course of this fascinating three-hour adventure full of deep-sea mysteries and discoveries, its moving melodies ebbed and flowed with my emotions and fueled my curiosity to reach the finale, even when the story lacked context. What you actually do along the way is a little light on gameplay, but it\u2019s still a spectacular journey worth taking.   Each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction and attention to detail. \u201c Abzu\u2019s intriguing underwater world is presented with little introduction \u2013 you\u2019re a mysterious diver who awakens and begins to explore \u2013 but it generates enough mystery to propel you through a series of stunning locations. From seaweed swaying in the current to mysterious sunken shrines, each area shows off Abzu\u2019s fantastic art direction, attention to detail, and an impressive sense of scale as you swim through enormous chasms under the sea.  This journey feels remarkable because of the way it constantly dangles the next intriguing area in front of you. I found myself traveling through its underwater rabbit hole into a strange, unfamiliar world full of cryptic iconography and ambient life such as fish, turtles, and whales. I was constantly wondering what I would find around the next bend, and each new area I discovered kept the surprises coming with fantastic architecture and some incredibly large spaces to swim in. And while nothing (including some intimidatingly large sharks) wants to actually eat you, it\u2019s still a fish-eat-fish world down here, and you can observe the convincingly recreated circle of life by meditating at a shark statue if you want.   Continuing on my journey I slowly waded into ancient ruins or completely lit-up, cathedral-like structures, and enjoyed the leisurely pace. In certain places it speeds up, and high-speed channels function like highways that pick up the pace and push you into beautiful new territory. One of the more memorable speedways had me swimming alongside a pod of incredibly large whales. It made me feel like a small fish in a very large pool.  Even during the most spectacular moments the framerate was almost always consistent at 30 per second despite the density of life on screen. I noticed it slow down slightly a handful of times, like when ultra dense schools of fish would swim in a tight loop.  The rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. \u201c Abzu\u2019s journey into the deep is conveyed primarily through pretty graphics, but its rousing, evocative musical score really steals the show. Each new area you explore is bookended by music from Journey composer Austin Wintory, and his contributions sound absolutely wonderful. The stirring ensemble of strings and flutes bounces back and forth between soothing tunes and rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. The orchestrations are carefully used to punctuate emotional moments in a way that I\u2019ve seen few games do, with the tempo rising and melting away into the background appropriately. And whenever the music dissipated, the ambient sounds of the sea served as a constant reminder that I was mostly alone in this world. It all makes Abzu the closest thing to a playable version of Disney\u2019s Fantasia that I\u2019ve seen produced by a video game.   But what are we actually doing here, other than taking in the sights and sounds? Abzu never makes that clear, either from a story perspective or with gameplay depth. I did enjoy my time swimming from the start because simple controls make is easy for almost anyone to pick up and enjoy moving around. Abzu uses a familiar control setup that resembles a driving game: holding the R2 button dives deeper and constantly moves you forward. You can boost to push through through areas quickly. Within minutes I could effortlessly maneuver in the water, do loop-the-loops, or break through to the surface and pull off a quick mid-air trick like a dolphin. And what limited interactions there are with the environment focus on helping you get around: you can grab onto fish when you want to move faster or slower.  Abzu's simple puzzle are designed to keep you moving ahead. \u201c It\u2019s just a little disappointing that Abzu\u2019s smooth movement isn\u2019t really put to the test by any form of challenge, like a race through the environment. You avoid a few hazards, but that\u2019s about it. Nasty underwater landmines are the only attacker you encounter, and outside of a worrisome warning bell when you get close their scary zaps are nothing more than a momentary hinderance. Abzu has some puzzles, too, but they\u2019re little more than quick flip switches that don\u2019t require a ton of thought. They\u2019re only meant to open up the next breathtaking location and keep pushing you forward.  The mystery Abzu presents at the start is intriguing, but the end of story is a little too abstract \u2013 even relative to other wordless storytelling adventures like Journey. There are a few cutscenes, but it mostly leans on environmental storytelling to fill in the gaps of what happened to an ancient, alien-looking civilization we find here. But what happened and why were very unclear, and on my first time through there wasn\u2019t enough context to give the ending the power it seemed to aim for. I couldn\u2019t quite place what Abzu wanted me to feel, so it just left me puzzled because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what had happened. But considering the entire thing is just three hours long, it\u2019s short enough that I didn\u2019t mind diving back in for another swim through to piece together the story, which revealed significantly more meaning now that I knew what to look for."

The best levels capture the feeling of a wild rollercoaster, often showcasing addictive combat scenarios that incentivized me to get on the ride again and again. But, in order to build up my piloting skills, I had to adapt to a demanding and unintuitive control scheme that pushed my ability to focus on the TV and the GamePad to the limit.  This radically redesigned Star Fox pays homage to its vintage late \u201890s source material, but the results of the modernization are mixed.

However, it takes the retro look a little too far in places, with a lot of plain-looking enemy ships and tall tanks made of simple geometry and dull textures that looks out of place in an otherwise-modern 2016 game. Yet even without elaborate graphics, the frame rate dips noticeably under the weight of large explosion effects in a couple of bigger combat arenas.  Overall, Star Fox Zero pulls it off, and part of that is thanks to the inherent charm from its zany cast of fly boys and their intentionally cheesy banter during the campaign. It taps into these one-note personality tropes with plenty of quips and one-liners that would please a writers\u2019 room of Saturday-morning cartoon producers, complete with plenty of \u201cI\u2019ll get you next time!\u201d threats from villains. Zero\u2019s story is a predictable re-tread of the N64 original, but it does a good job of refreshing it for a new audience.  Space Jam  The campaign can be completed in roughly five hours, but you won\u2019t see everything on your first pass, and it does a lot to encourage more playthroughs so you can collect hidden medals and post high scores on the leaderboard. For example, some excellent skirmishes offer lots of targets to shoot, but if you keep your cool you\u2019ll spot clever side exits that lead to entirely new areas. These hidden pathways crisscross through the galaxy, opening up challenging new courses featuring powered-up enemies or massive alternate bosses that must be defeated before a timer runs out. Carefully prodding and poking stages for secrets is the only way to unlock all 20 campaign missions.  Others levels in Star Fox Zero pull off impressive scale and spectacle. The hyperspeed trek through the Gamma Sector is a delightful trip through a tight spaces and deadly obstacles, while the tumultuous trek through the desert planet of Titania is full of falling debris and loaded with enemy ships to shoot down with the firepower of an awesome tank at your disposal.  The one lame trip in my tour through the galaxy was Zoness, a plodding stealth level that felt more like busywork than an action-packed Disneyland attraction. In it, I had to man a frustratingly slow craft and deploy a personable-yet-dull robot companion to deactivate enemy defenses. Zoness squanders a lot of its potential with uninspired design, which often sees enemies conveniently patrolling around explosives or other hazards that made them trivial to destroy. It just doesn\u2019t come together as well as Star Fox Zero\u2019s rocket-fueled missions through livelier planets of the Lylat System.  Big boss battles are Star Fox Zero\u2019s best moments, and each one feels different. From air-to-air dogfights with the rival pilots of Star Wolf to a nasty face off with Monarch Dodora, an enormous winged boss that shoots a powerful laser from its tail, each fight focuses on using crucial maneuvers like flips to get behind enemies, barrell rolls (do one!) to avoid incoming projectiles, or blowing up pieces of a boss to expose its main weak point.  There\u2019s some extra variety that comes from piloting a handful of different vehicles in certain missions, and Nintendo does a good job of making each craft feel unique, for better or worse. The Arwing quickly became my favorite because it can maneuver quickly in air-to-air combat, and while it\u2019s clunkier and not quite as fun when it transforms into bipedal tank mode, it\u2019s still much more enjoyable than the annoying and slow-as-molasses Gyrowing hovercraft. The Landmaster tank is another slow-moving vehicle, but it makes up for it with sheer, satisfying firepower that can take down enemies quickly. Collecting medals opens up difficult challenge missions for each vehicle so I could put my expert skills to the test, but you\u2019ll have to stick with a frustrating learning curve to become an ace pilot at these controls.  The Right (and Wrong) Stuff  What\u2019s baffling about Star Fox Zero is that piloting a vehicle is complex and awkward at times because Nintendo chose to split our view of the action across two screens. The TV shows a traditional third-person perspective so you can see the space behind your ship, while the GamePad displays a transparent cockpit view that you use to aim at enemies using motions controls. I eventually did get good at it, but the learning process made my first hours more frustrating than they should\u2019ve been. I often ran right smack into enemies and walls since it was hard to focus on moving and shooting at the same time.  The problem comes when trying to maintain control as you move your eyes between the two screens, especially since the perspectives affect how you aim. Even through the TV shows a larger field of view, sometimes using it to take an unassisted shot that looks like it should hit will completely miss. In those cases, you have to look down at the GamePad to line up a precise volley, then look back up to take in your surroundings and push forward.  The good news is that the GamePad\u2019s tilt controls feel competent no matter what vehicle you\u2019re in, and it was easy to manipulate the cursor and fire at targets. Nintendo also gives pilots lots of alternate input options that alleviate some of the stress of driving: you can choose between using the analog sticks or buttons to pull off somersaults, quick 180- degree turn, or fire smart bombs. It feels like a job made for two people, and co-op mode appropriately splits up the two screens into two roles. This is the best way to play, since one person assumes the role of a pilot while a friend mans the guns. But the lock-on camera introduces a problem on the first boss: Because the perspective is stuck in a fixed perspective, the pilot can\u2019t see directly in front of him without access to the view on the GamePad, and that\u2019s kind of important! It\u2019s difficult to pick up rings, or fly in general."

        "Subtitle": "WayForward debuts on Wii U with an HD upgrade of a 3DS great.",
        "Content": "Officer Patricia Wagon is back. Eleven months ago, back in the 3DS eShop, we were first introduced to her \u2013 a cybernetic, intergalactic policewoman on the hunt to apprehend five escaped prisoners in the fast-paced platformer Mighty Switch Force . She pursued the Space Hooligan sisters through several puzzle-packed stages, using her unique helmet-mounted siren to dynamically switch blocks in the environment from the background to the foreground and vice versa. The levels were all built to be the stuff of speedrunners\u2019 dreams, and while I had some issues with the pressure imposed by the game\u2019s ever-present par times, I still recognized Patty\u2019s debut as a great game in my 8/10 review . Now, a great game has become greater. Mighty Switch Force: Hyper Drive Edition is the new Wii U-exclusive upgrade of that 3DS design, and it makes two key changes to its source material. First, it adds all-new \u201cHyper\u201d versions of each level \u2013 making them much more challenging \u2013 and second, it remasters/redraws every piece of art in the game. The Hyper levels don\u2019t require much analysis, as they are suitably stressful and the players who mastered the original game\u2019s set of stages will no doubt love the chance to pull their hair out in frustration over how maddening these remixes can be \u2013 their addition alone is enough to recommend a double-dip for dedicated fans of the first release. The art, though, is the real draw here. It\u2019s absolutely fabulous. It looks like a concept artist\u2019s sketchbook has just come to life on the screen \u2013 Officer Wagon, the Hooligans, every enemy character and even the Ugly Twitching Dog all look brilliant in high definition, with fluid animation built from animation-cel quality still frames that exceed the work of several cartoons on the air today. Mighty Switch Force was pretty before, as WayForward\u2019s skill at spritework is legendary \u2013 but this is just gorgeous. What\u2019s more, you can choose to view that art in two different ways \u2013 up on your HDTV, or held in your hands via the GamePad-only mode. Either method is excellent, and after some new Wii U owners get a taste of how addictive the GamePad-only play style is through other titles like New Super Mario Bros. U, this new Mighty Switch Force will be a great option to keep the pseudo-portable good times rolling. Hyper Drive Edition isn\u2019t perfect, as I do still wish the par times could be toggled off for the first run through the game. The Wii U GamePad\u2019s buttons also doesn\u2019t feel quite as precise as those on the 3DS in handling Patty\u2019s movements \u2013 getting the timing right in triggering block shifts will take a bit of brain re-training for veterans of the first version, and your completion times will likely suffer a bit to begin with. And WayForward missed the second chance to add leaderboards. For a game so focused on speedrunning and completion times, it\u2019s silly to not have a place to brag about your best runs \u2013 especially since the studio\u2019s had almost a year of extra time to implement them. There\u2019s the Miiverse community, of course, but its casual posts and commentary are no substitute for seeing your name at the top of a list of runners-up.",

        "Content": "Professional basketball has a sense of style that is unique to the world of sports. The glowing arenas, fashionable apparel and high speed of the game are all unmatched. On the court, it\u2019s not just about the win or the loss, it\u2019s about the way you look doing it. NBA 2K19 builds upon its strong gameplay, fantastic presentation, and wide array of game modes to embody this attitude. Its style is cramped a bit by a small number of persistent issues with AI behavior and obscene microtransactions in the MyPlayer mode, but other than that, NBA 2K19 is a high point for the series. Getting into the action isn\u2019t as smooth as it could be because NBA 2K19 has a tougher learning curve than the series has in the past, one that rewards skill and punishes novice play. Even as a veteran of the series, I found myself getting pounded by the CPU on the default difficulty level as I relearned the old mechanics and adapted to a slew of defensive improvements that make dribble-drives much more difficult. (I actually found playing online against others who were struggling with the same things to be a better learning tool.) This year places a tremendous amount of emphasis on ball control and maximizing your players\u2019 abilities. Each time the buzzer rang, however, I felt myself getting a little better.  NBA 2K19 did an excellent job of rewarding me for taking the time to learn its various skill moves, including a complex post-game and set of dribbling techniques. Pulling off a Steph Curry step-back jumper or a Lebron James fadeaway is really satisfying, especially because of the work you need to put into learning them first. Unfortunately, the complex nature of the controls and movement system can lead to some really unflattering moments. A successful move leads to a beautiful animation that seems perfectly in tune with what you would see in any NBA game, but an unsuccessful attempt often results in your player running into the defender awkwardly. I\u2019ve seen instances where the AI will start a dribble move only to bump right into a defender, carrying them all the way into a backcourt violation. For a game that is usually so naturally fluid with its motion, these hiccups are easy to spot. Pulling off a Steph Curry step-back jumper or a Lebron James fadeaway is really satisfying. \u201c While it\u2019s an improvement over previous iterations, NBA 2K19 still struggles in transition. Floor spacing is a little better but still underwhelming. Despite playing as some of the best athletes in the world, the fast break still feels too slow to develop. There have been several instances where an easy transition dunk turns into my own teammate running right out in front of me and preventing that from happening. Even with guys like Russell Westbrook, who are traditionally phenomenal in transition, I\u2019d find myself having to settle for a jumper instead of being able to get to the basket. The AI does a nice job of distributing the ball to its playmakers, which really accentuates how different every player feels. Guys like Karl-Anthony Towns dominate the paint with their athleticism while someone like Jonas Valanciunas will make you pay if you let him pop out of the pick and roll. There have been instances, however, where the AI will actively avoid open players in order to get the ball to their superstar, which is a bit absurd. Off-ball movement is actually pretty good, which makes it even more frustrating that players will work themselves open for a shot and never get to touch the ball. The AI also has a really bad tendency to hold onto the ball beyond the three-point line, even when time isn\u2019t in its favor. Thankfully, this only happens a couple of times every game, but it\u2019s certainly jarring when the AI puts up such a good fight everywhere else. Every IGN NBA 2K Review Ever 24 Images  NBA 2K19 shines on the defensive end of the court thanks to tight controls and emphasis on player ratings. Lockdown defenders like Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard stand out against weaker defenders. As a compliment to the complex mechanics available on offense, defense became much more of a chess match. Predicting what moves they\u2019ll make and when they will make them becomes of the utmost importance, especially if you don\u2019t have a strong defense behind you. Making sure your roster has at least one or two defensive stoppers, even if they\u2019re lacking offensive talent like Andre Roberson, is now a priority. The most noticeable difference comes from the interior, where bigs are no longer content letting guys like James Harden blow by on a one-on-one dribble drive. It is hard to make the defensive side of things interesting and engaging, but it helps keep NBA 2K19 fun all of the time instead of just half of it.  More Than a Game  While the immense amount of animations dedicated to matching the identity of their real-life counterparts helps, players have a tendency to look a little strange from the neck down. Lebron James, who is large and muscular, shouldn\u2019t have the same body type as Rajon Rondo, who is trim by comparison. The players\u2019 faces do a fine job differentiating one player from the next, at least among the more popular stars, but it\u2019s still an odd look. Beyond player physique, NBA 2K19 is a masterclass in presentation. From before the tip-off to when the lights shut off in the arena, there is always fantastic quality and attention to detail. Clever in-game commentary can keep even a blowout game interesting through small anecdotal stories on the part of former NBA player Clark Kellogg or more personal details about players that add to the impact of what they are doing on the court. For instance, I never knew that Jimmy Butler likes to pay for other people\u2019s groceries while at the store. Hearing about it mid-game made me want to trade for him later that season. On top of that, there are excellent interviews \u2013 some that appear to be shot from a booth and others that are done on the court \u2013 with players using their real-life voices. Seeing someone like Dirk Nowitzki interviewed about basketball mechanics is a fun detail that feels thoroughly executed. Similarly entertaining are the pre and post-game shows from Ernie Johnson Jr., Charles Barkley, [Correction: that's Kenny Smith], and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. They possess the same unique chemistry and charm in NBA 2K19 as they do on TNT, providing both useful insight and comedic delivery that break up the seriousness of a sports match. The pre-game show transitions really well into the pizzazz of the on-court battle, where the arenas are theatrical and the attire is chic. Because of the depth in its presentation, no two games of NBA 2K19 ever feel the same, giving it more than ample replay value.  Thankfully, there are a dozen or so different ways to digest NBA 2K19\u2019s strong gameplay and presentation. The best, and perhaps the only mode that matches the intensity of the complex mechanics, is MyLeague. MyLeague allows you to build upon (or create from the ground up) an NBA franchise with an inordinate amount of customization. From something like the frequency of trades taking place across the league to the shade of orange you want the New York Knicks to have, nothing seems like it is off the table. This game mode really struck my desire to run the NBA the way I see fit, which included lots of unreasonable trades between superstars and the dismantling of the Golden State Warriors, and became the perfect medium for me to enjoy NBA 2K19\u2019s strengths.  The story never lacks for interesting conflict. \u201c NBA 2K19 also enjoys its strongest MyCareer mode yet with The Way Back, which is much more story-focused than in previous years. A.I., whose name might the most unfortunate part of the mode due to the NBA\u2019s history with a more well-known player by the same nickname in Allen Iverson, is a complicated protagonist who isn\u2019t always reasonable or kind. The resulting story of his attempt to be picked up in the NBA feels personal, and certainly more pragmatic than I expected from a franchise that has really struggled in this regard. The story never lacks for interesting conflict, but it starts to run out of creative juice toward the back end. A.I.\u2019s constant struggle to learn that the scope of professional basketball goes beyond his own wellbeing is a theme that goes to the well one too many times. Sadly, while The Way Back poses as an RPG with impactful decisions that can be made at various points throughout the story, in a second playthrough I found that, at least early on, these choices have very little impact on the storyline. Similarly, the way I performed in the games that took place in between cutscenes seemed to have very little to do with the direction of A.I.\u2019s career. There were moments where I\u2019d perform horribly, only to be told in a cutscene afterward that I had the game of a lifetime. Also, the teammate grade you are given as a result of your performance is incredibly inconsistent, as it would dock an unreasonable amount of score for things out of your control while barely adding any for things like setting screens. All the same, the writing is unusually strong for a game mode like this and appearances from Anthony Mackie and Haley Joel Osment bring life to a fun and relatively short (at about five hours) MyCareer mode. Not all of the game modes felt as well worth my time as MyLeague and MyCareer. NBA 2K\u2019s foray into the card-opening business feels all too familiar, with currency being a little too hard to come by \u2013 especially because it\u2019s the same currency you use to bolster A.I.\u2019s stats in MyCareer. Naturally, 2K is willing to sell you virtual currency to speed along the process, but that comes at a frighteningly high cost. Normal packs range anywhere from about $5 to $10 where more expensive boxes go for double of that. Even the more expensive packs don\u2019t guarantee you the players you want, so I was much happier to spend the $25 worth of currency that came with the Anniversary Edition on my MyPlayer. Without dedicating major time to MyTeam, it\u2019s hard to imagine being competitive with people who will shell out the cash for a better team. Thankfully, MyLeague is entirely devoid of these microtransactions, making it much easier to enjoy without any second thought.  There is also a Blacktop mode that includes street basketball, whether it be one-on-one half court or five-on-five full court. I had fun here playing as some of my favorite NBA legends, like John Stockton and Allen Iverson, but I couldn\u2019t help but wish the gameplay branched off into something more exaggerated and along the lines of NBA Street or NBA Jam. Instead, it feels like a slightly modified version of what you\u2019d normally see in NBA 2K19.  My time with online play was mostly positive, with the largest issue being a very small delay between the push of a button and the resulting action. Unfortunately, when the shooting mechanics rely almost entirely upon that timing, it can lead to some frustrating misses or turnovers that may not have happened otherwise. This was especially easy to notice when shooting free throws, which became almost impossible to time. At its worst, I did have some instances when online where it would freeze altogether, taking me out of control for chunks at a time. It\u2019s unfortunate because there is a real element of strategy when facing a human opponent and some of that is lost in the latency. But if you don\u2019t have someone to play with locally, the thrill of going back and forth with another player, especially with the improved defense which largely removed cheap ways of scoring easily, is still worth the effort."

        "Content": "SEGA's entry into the Vita ring brings its hit tennis game to handhelds. Seems like an odd choice for the first Vita game from SEGA , but hey, Virtua Tennis' arcade tennis style is a good fit for the handheld.  Between the two major tennis games, Virtua Tennis was always the more arcade style game, while Top Spin was a more traditional tennis sim. Virtua Tennis 4 stays true to its roots. It's got a wacky, over-the-top feel, and there is more of a focus on exciting tennis action and less on stats and attributes.     Virtua Tennis 4 plays really well. The controls are tight, the animations are good, and the game has a great difficulty progression. The opponents feel unique and require different strategies to defeat. It's satisfying to hit a smash and watch the other guy dive for it. Not gonna lie, I yelled obscenities both in anger and joy during the final, most difficult tournament, and that's how a high energy, emotional game like tennis should feel.  The biggest problem with Virtua Tennis 4 is that it feels like I've played all this before. Not only because I literally played this before when it was out on PS3, but also because the series hasn't changed much. The meat of the game doesn't feel different than Virtua Tennis 3. It's nearly all the same players, and the mechanics are identical. Not that there's a lot that can be improved in a tennis game (it's essentially a glorified Pong), but it's hard to get excited for a game I've played already.  Virtua Tennis 4 isn't all a rehash, but the new features don't add a lot to the experience. The World Tour is now a bizarre board game, adding a level of randomness to the career. While it certainly keeps things interesting, it does little more than add a sense of frustration whenever I couldn't play a tournament or mini-game when I wanted to because the game forced me to move in random intervals on the game board.  Likewise the mini-games are back, with the same zaniness like gathering chicks, and playing hot potato with a time bomb, but these are momentary distractions. I commend SEGA for making my training sessions in career mode more interesting than just practicing a backhand, but the games aren't fun enough to play on their own (which is what the game's Party mode is all about).  Thankfully Virtua Tennis 4 features an Arcade mode, a more streamlined four-match tournament that gives you a decent challenge without all the fluff. And there is an online mode, though I wish it was more robust. I can play matches against people, and there's a ranking system that keeps track of my wins, but it'd be nice to set up an online career or tournament structure. That isn't too much to ask.   Vita Features   For the Vita version of Virtua Tennis, SEGA crammed some new features and mini-games into the package. You can use the camera to take a picture of your face, creating a frightening version of yourself as a playable character. The camera can also be used to pose with the game's 3D modeled tennis stars (like you really know them!).  Like the camera, most of the other Vita features seem superfluous or tacked on. The touchscreen multiplayer turns tennis into an awkward game of Pong. The VR camera mimics the motion control mode from the console games, which is fun, but only as a diversion.  The main game's touch controls allow you to swipe for shots and move your player around the court, but I found it to be slower and less responsive than the button controls. I kept switching back to the normal control scheme and eventually just never went back to touch controls. It's a good try, but when the game gets intense towards the end you need the precision of the normal control scheme.",

        "Content": "For retro enthusiasts, finding legitimate modern ways to experience games from 40 or more years ago can be a daunting task. Sure, most of the popular ones have been repackaged and released in various collections or mini consoles throughout the years, but what about some of the more obscure titles that nobody seems to remember? Evercade Handheld 15 Images Blaze Entertainment heard those pleas, and while its Evercade platform offers a vast library of titles spanning decades of arcade and home consoles to collect and play, the handheld itself leaves much to be desired. Evercade Handheld \u2013 Design and Features Right off the bat, the Evercade has a distinct retro aesthetic that\u2019s oozing with \u201870s and \u201880s vibes. It features an off-white exterior with striking red trim and grey accents. The face has a glass-like plastic finish and it\u2019s all tied together with smooth, rounded edges. It includes four face buttons as well as start and select on the right side of the screen with a rocker-style D-pad and menu button on the opposite side. All the buttons feel great to press with the D-pad specifically \u201cdesigned to feel like classic consoles.\u201d On the top of the handheld are two very low-profile shoulder buttons that unfortunately depress way too easily \u2013 I would constantly find myself pressing them and hearing the audible \u201cclick\u201d while just holding the device naturally. Thankfully, most of the arcade-era games don\u2019t utilize these buttons, but for the games that do it led to some frustration and required me to rest my index fingers behind the shoulder buttons so as not to accidentally press either one. Even worse, the right shoulder button frequently got stuck, which is a bit concerning right out of the box. There\u2019s also a power toggle switch and a micro HDMI output for connecting the device to your television and using the Evercade Handheld as a controller, although this less-common cable is not included in the box. On the rear, there\u2019s a large open slot for the Evercade cartridges, which become flush with the unit once inserted, making for an inconspicuous, seamless look. Across the bottom are two volume buttons, a headphone jack for connecting a pair of wired headphones, and a micro USB port for recharging the internal battery. You can expect to get roughly four hours of battery life on a single charge, and during my testing I found this to be accurate. One nice feature to prolong the device\u2019s battery is that the display will automatically turn off after about 30 seconds of inactivity, only to instantly wake when any button is pressed. Speaking of the display, the Evercade Handheld features a 4.5-inch widescreen with a 480 x 272 resolution. That said, since most of the games use a traditional 4:3 aspect ratio, the widescreen feels a bit wasted outside of the system menus. Resolution aside, the display is very low-quality with terrible viewing angles. Looking at it straight on is fine, but the slightest tilt causes the display to become noticeably darker. Tilting it down roughly 45-degrees causes the colors to become completely inverted, something I haven\u2019t seen in a handheld device since what feels like the \u201890s. For a sub-$100 handheld device it\u2019s clearly not going to compete with the likes of the Nintendo Switch or even modern smartphones, but this screen technology still feels completely outdated in 2021. Evercade Handheld \u2013 Software Evercade features a library of retro and arcade collections housed on proprietary cartridges that can only be played on the Evercade Handheld or the upcoming Evercade VS home console. These carts are roughly the width of a GameBoy cartridge, but about two-thirds the height with a rounded edge that sits flush with the handheld when inserted. Each cartridge features a small collection of games, some with just a couple, some more than a dozen. Most game collections are grouped by publishers such as Atari, Namco, and Data East, just to name a few. Currently, there are 26 collections containing more than 280 games spanning arcade games as well as various home consoles. In other words, you can expect roughly 11 games per cartridge, on average. With each cartridge costing 15 pounds (or roughly $21 USD) it\u2019s a decent value and for many of the games, the only way to play them on a \u201cmodern\u201d console. While many of the usual suspects are present, such as Pac-Man, Galaga, Asteroids, and Double Dragon, far too many of the games are filler titles and likely won\u2019t see much play time. Furthermore, many of the popular titles are split across different collections, requiring you to buy multiple cartridges if you want to play a handful of favorites. (Seriously, how did Mappy Kids make it into Namco Museum Collection 1 over Galaga?) Regardless, Evercade is clearly marketed towards collectors and retro enthusiasts, and the neat little numbered cases would look great on a shelf. It\u2019s hard enough to collect retro games as it is, so having a company dedicated to packaging them for you is a nice bonus. Evercade Handheld \u2013 Gaming After inserting your desired cartridge, you\u2019ll browse through the menu that includes each game\u2019s box art, screenshot, year of release, and genre. You can also change the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9, if you prefer, as well as adjust brightness and change between six different languages. The only thing missing from the main menu section are the controls for each individual game. Instead, this information is contained within a booklet inside each collection\u2019s case, along with screenshots and tips for each game. The Evercade Premium Pack includes three game collections: Atari Collection 1, which features 20 games such as Centipede, Asteroids, Missile Command, and more; Namco Museum Collection 1 \u2013 11 games such as Pac-Man, Galaxian, and Dig Dug; and the Interplay Collection 1, which has six games including Earthworm Jim and Clay Fighter. Gameplay was smooth for each of the games I played across the three included collections, and bouncing between games couldn\u2019t be easier. What\u2019s nice is each game features six save states that can be accessed at any moment, allowing you to easily pause and return to a game you were in the middle of without being forced to completely restart. This is a welcome feature for many of the arcade games that don\u2019t have built-in game saves. The rocker-style D-pad feels very similar to that of the Sega Genesis\u2019 controller. It\u2019s incredibly easy to press in any direction and can easily be rotated in a circle. While this is great for some of the platformers and fighting games, I often found I was making mistakes in the traditional arcade games that require more precise directional input, specifically when sliding my finger across the D-pad to quickly change directions as they didn\u2019t register. Other than this small issue that can easily be remedied by pressing each input instead of sliding over to it, the D-pad and face buttons feel responsive. Purchasing Guide Since the Evercade Handheld is manufactured in the UK, it\u2019s primarily sold through UK retailers such as Amazon UK or GAME for a suggested retail price of 59 pounds (or roughly $85 USD) not including international shipping. It can also be found at US retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for $99, although the collection includes the Data East Collection 1 in place of the Namco Museum Collection 1."

Unfortunately, servers are still struggling, which means your mileage may vary day-to-day when it comes to online features. But the silver lining is the mostly formidable AI can make even offline matches interesting and tense. The execution of this simple idea is so strong and so engaging that it keeps bringing me back, time and time again, for just one more match.\u201d ( Read the archived original Rocket League review .) Now, nearly three years later and with all the additional updates, features, and new platforms (including the newly launched Nintendo Switch version), Psyonix\u2019s insane formula of rocket-powered cars playing sports has only gotten better with age. The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn\u2019t changed a bit. The rules are simple: two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy, brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. A game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. \u201c But there\u2019s a golden layer of strategy and mechanical depth tucked inside the chaotic mashing of metal. Timing a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick to connect with the ball and send it sailing at a precise angle takes notable skill. Those basics, when coupled with expert teamplay and mind-blowing booster-powered aerial maneuvers, solidify Rocket League as a game that\u2019s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that\u2019s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit. At launch, the content around that gameplay felt a little barebones. Since then, though, it\u2019s been substantially fleshed out with smart alternate modes that emphasize different skills and add variety. The Snow Day hockey mode substitutes a dense, oversized puck for the bouncier soccer ball; Hoops is a basketball variant emphasizing aerial play; Dropshot is a two-sided floor-breaking mode; and Rumble mode deals out power-ups that disrupt players and influence the ball. It\u2019s all a ton of fun. And of course, the competitive playlist for the traditional 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 shines as the great ladder system Rocket League was missing to bring some-term goals to its pick-up-and-play ease, offering seasonal cosmetic rewards and bragging rights as you try to climb through the ranked tiers. Decisions, Decisions Overall, Rocket League remains a balanced multiplayer playing field. While the mechanical differences between the free cars and the large assortment of paid-for downloadable cars are noticeable, they\u2019re barely relevant. Sure, some cars turn slightly faster, some have better hitboxes for flipping, but these small differences only really matter at the highest levels of competition, where a few modest purchases don\u2019t seem like too much to ask. The cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. \u201c Serious players have their go-to speedsters, but even with the continuous influx of brand-associated cars you can purchase and use, you\u2019re still totally effective on the field. That\u2019s a list that includes the Batmobile, a DeLorean, and the platform-exclusive cars like the Mario/Luigi-mobile, Halo's Warthog, or Sweet Tooth's ice cream truck. Meanwhile, the cache of hundreds of tradeable cosmetic items continues to grow. With everything from customizable goal explosions to player banners, there are innumerable combinations that allow you to truly stand out, and almost all of it can be earned just by playing. There\u2019s some grinding, sure, but you\u2019re always rewarded, and even duplicate items can be stacked up and traded in for items of better quality using a rudimentary crafting system that adds another layer to the appeal of collecting cosmetics. And yes, Rocket League does come with loot crates that you earn for playing online matches (roughly one every 10 hours of play), but here they\u2019re used relatively inoffensively and can be completely toggled off in the options menu when setting up a game. You can't purchase them with real money, so there's no real pay-to-win element \u2013 especially since these items don't actually do anything other than make you look rad. Instead, they're more like optional rewards you get for grinding out online matches that you can open if you decide to spend $1.50 for a key (or $1 each if you buy in bulk). If you don\u2019t want to spend money at all, you can still get at the contents of these boxes by participating in special, limited-time events that award you keys just for playing more Rocket League. Your Platform Mileage May Vary The sheen on Rocket League\u2019s sleek, neon-coated look varies by platform. On everything but Switch, it runs from the standard 1080p all the way up to 4K on PS4 Pro and PC right now. (4K and HDR support is confirmed to be coming soon to Xbox One X.) Visually, you can\u2019t really go wrong with any version, since Psyonix has made efforts to ensure that you\u2019re always getting 60 frames per second in one- and two-player local splitscreen game modes on most maps. But maintaining that frame rate comes at a price on the Switch, which runs a resolution of around 526p in handheld, and 720p while docked. Blown up on a decently sized TV, you can easily see a lot of rough, jagged lines and edges, both during matches and even in menus, and missing visual effects in arenas. That said, in handheld mode it\u2019s incredibly cool to be able to play Rocket League no matter where you are in a portable enough form that beats the hell out of carrying a laptop and a controller around. But the small screen in portable mode makes it difficult to be as precise, and I regularly found I had a harder time nailing those precise angles that become second nature over time. And that becomes much worse when trying to play local split-screen on the Switch in tabletop mode - half of a small screen is almost comical. While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go \u2013 which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode \u2013 the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent on all platforms."
